## SYNOPSIS

- The adventure begins when the head acolyte of the Church of St. Terragnis contacts the party for help in finding the church's missing priest, Father Reginal Baird.
- While the characters are at the church, undead creatures erupt into the main chamber, massacre the people present, and retreat with living victims.
- The characters follow the undead down the empty well in the church's undercroft, leading them to the catacombs beneath.
- Inside the catacombs, the characters find clues about the fate of Father Baird.
- The adventure culminates in a battle against the fallen Father Baird and the horde of undead he controls with the Whisperskull.


## BACKGROUND

- A few months before the adventure begins, Father Reginald Baird discovered an ancient set of catacombs under his church.
- The catacombs belong to a centuries-gone empire of dark priests and warlords who leveraged necromantic magic.
- Father Baird began secretly exploring the catacombs and recently fell to the temptation of a vile artifact hidden therein called the Whisperskull.
- Father Baird is now under the sway of the Whisperskull and has begun animating the bodies interred in the catacombs.
- The adventure begins when Father Baird takes his next step - capturing living victims to use their blood for the rituals the Whisperskull demands...


## A WORD TO THE GM

This adventure is meant to be run at a glance with minimal preparation and a natural delivery. This required re-thinking the normal adventure presentation a bit. Here's what you'll find included:

- Each encounter contained on one page.
- Bulleted lists. Bolded keywords.
- Hyperlinks to monsters and rules online for quick reference.
- Printable cards for each monster and PC so you can run encounters using a card stack. A short video walkthrough of this method can be found here.
- Printable cards for special treasure handouts.
- Short room and area descriptions. No paragraphs of droning flavor text - set the scene naturally and embellish as desired.
- Briefly explained non-encounter rooms. Again, embellish as desired!
- GM maps and player-safe digital maps for use with virtual tabletops.
- A short video walkthrough of the adventure can be found here.


## PACING/TRANSITIONS

A dramatic question is presented with most scenes. Once that question has been answered, the tension of the scene is resolved. That's your cue to work toward the transition provided at the end the scene - even if that means summarizing the end of a clearly decided combat, or in the case of clever players, skipping combat altogether. Keep the game moving toward the next challenge!
Room descriptions that are usually long blocks of literary read-aloud text have been left short and informational in this adventure. Many Game Masters prefer to paraphrase readaloud text and set the scene based on what tone and level of detail his or her group finds engaging. Anything listed before the Development sections is safe to share however you prefer to do so.

## A MISSING PRIEST

The characters begin in any city of sufficient size to house a large church and the ruins of a fallen civilization below ground.

Allow the players to describe their preliminary actions in the city before moving on to the following adventure hooks.

## APPEAL TO REWARD

Tibalt Throgsden, the head acolyte of the Church of St. Terragnis, reaches out to the characters by messenger. He implores them, in the name of good St. Terragnis, to help find the missing Father Reginald Baird. Father Baird disappeared three days ago, and the church
![img-1.jpeg](Crypts%20of%20Azarumme%20Print%20Friendly%20V3_img-1.jpeg)
will reward each character 100 gp and a boon of healing or aid if they will help find the priest. Tibald invites the group to the church to discuss the matter in greater detail.

## APPEAL TO HEROISM

While in a church of religious importance to the group (you can substitute another god for St. Terragnis, if needed), begin the adventure's first encounter, They Came From Below. Following the attack, the survivors ask the characters to rescue any victims the undead dragged down into the well. If Tibalt is alive, he reveals that Father Baird has been missing probably down the same well - for the last three days.

## APPEAL TO DISCOVERY

Tibalt approaches the characters about an ominous turn of events - Father Baird recently discovered a series of ancient catacombs beneath the well in the church's undercroft. Father Baird warned Tibalt never to go down the well or to tell others about it in case it inspired foolish dares among the younger acolytes. Now the priest is missing, and Tibalt fears Father Baird got trapped in the catacombs while trying to ensure there was nothing dangerous down there.

## TRANSITION

Move to They Came From Below once the characters decide to go to the church.

---

## THEY CAME FROM BELOW

## CHURCH OF ST. TERRAGNIS

- The church has high, arched ceilings with windows that illuminate a haze of incense.
- Eight young acolytes scurry around main hall preparing for the evening's worship.
- Tibalt Throgsden greets the characters near the door. He sizes them up in conversation.
- If Tibalt trusts the characters, he pulls them aside in the main hall and explains his theory that Father Baird went missing down the well in the church's undercroft.

Tibalt Throgsden, LG dwarf acolyte
"St. Terragnis protects those who keep their faith in dark times. He must have sent you to us."

- Appearance. Young. Red beard. Lightly rumpled robes and an oversized tabard of St. Terragnis that's a bit too long.
- Does. Clucks his tongue at the younger acolytes and directs them with authority.
- Secret. Much less confident than he seems - on the verge of panic at running the church without Father Baird.


## DEVELOPMENT

- During the discussion with Tibalt, any character whose passive Wisdom (Perception) score is 13 or higher hears a distant crash back inside the church's chambers.
- Two rounds later, four ghasts and six ghouls with glowing, green eyes smash into the main hall from the interior rooms.


## DRAMATIC QUESTION

Can the group survive the massacre and protect the acolytes?

COMBAT
-The undead mob is here to collect four victims for Father
Baird to sacrifice to the Whisperskull. They capture up to four acolytes over the course of three rounds before retreating with their victims.
-The preternaturally intelligent ghouls use their overwhelming numbers to paralyze acolytes (use the commoner stat block) and drag them to the well in the undercroft.
-The ghasts stay behind to block passage to the undercroft until their brethren have escaped with the victims.

## Treasure

The undead have shards of emerald embedded in their eyes. The shards glow with green flame while embedded in an animate undead's eyes, but the glow fades five minutes after a shard is removed from its host. Each is worth $\mathbf{1 0} \mathbf{g p}$.

## TRANSITION

Use one of the adventure hooks in A Missing Priest if the characters are not already invested in searching for Father Baird. Move to Down The Well when the group goes down the dry, crumbling well in the undercroft.

---

## DOWN THE WELL

## Sidebar: Inside the Catacombs

- The catacombs are redolent with necromantic energy. The halls reek of decay and stale air, and darkness permeates.
- Thousands of bones are packed together to form grisly walls and ceilings.
- For each hour the PCs spend here, each must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. Upon failure, he or she is afflicted with an effect from the Corrupt The Living table (Appendix C). The effects last for 24 hours.


## AREA 1: THE BOTTOM OF THE WELL

- The well goes down 40 feet to a circular, crumbling chamber.
- Two tunnels of unworked stone extend in opposite directions from the chamber. Water sloshes somewhere in the distance.
- A sealed, stone door sits opposite the tunnels. Two hands holding a deep bowl form the handles. The door has no lock.


## DEVELOPMENT

- The door bears a faded inscription carved in Infernal that says, "Pay now the toll of the living lest ye enter the domain of the dead too rich in life."
- A DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals traces of magic in the bowl.
- Characters can smash the door open with a DC 23 Strength check. The door glides open if the bowl is filled with 1 d 10 hit points' worth of fresh blood.


## AREA 2: HALLS OF BONE

- Alcoves line the walls of a hall extending into a large, open chamber. A skeleton is lashed into a standing position in each alcove. They clutch rosaries of human teeth.
- A hooded statue looms over an altar at the end of the chamber. Its hands reach down to a shallow bowl that flickers with green fire.


## DEVELOPMENT

- Tarry blood congeals in the glowing bowl on the altar. If a character places an inert emerald shard into the bowl, the shard glows and energizes for five minutes.
- Inspecting the skeleton in the second alcove reveals shallow gouges in its eye sockets. If a character jams an energized emerald shard into the socket, the skeleton jerks to life with a scream and pushes the secret door behind it open. It is restrained, weaponless, and won't fight.


## AREA 3: ALTAR OF THE SKULL

- The walls and ceiling are decorated with hundreds of leering skulls.
- A rune-carved altar with an empty, shallow divot in the center dominates the chamber.
- A torn, bloody priest's tabard lies on the floor.


## DEVELOPMENT

- Touching the altar imparts an unpleasant, temporary numbness.
- The inscription on the altar is in Infernal: "Feed life to the skull, and it shall give ye death to wield against the enemies of Azarumme."
- Characters proficient in Intelligence (History) know Azarumme was an ancient, dark empire that fell centuries ago.
- Characters with a passive Intelligence (History) check of 15 or higher know Azarumme was a bloodthirsty dynasty ruled by vampiric warlords and lich-queens.


## Treasure

Tangled in the priest's tabard is a silver holy symbol of St. Terragnis worth 50 gp . A goodaligned creature who wears it has advantage on one Wisdom ability check per day.

## TRANSITION

Go to Twisting Catacombs if the characters move to the tunnels in Area 1.

---

## TWISTING CATACOMBS

## Sidebar: Unstable Ground

- Sinkholes lurk along the floors of the catacombs. These pits are 30 feet deep. For each round a creature stands in a square adjacent to a pit, there's a $\mathbf{2 5 \%}$ chance the square will collapse into a new 5 -foot wide, 30 -foot deep pit (maximum two per pit).
- Characters may avoid falling into a pit with a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw.


## AREA 4: UNDERGROUND SPRING

- The halls stacked with skeletal remains widen into a broad, echoing cavern.
- A still pool of sulfurous water simmers at the back of the cavern. Several limp bodies in white tabards float in it. Blood drifts from their wrists in thin ribbons.


## SPARE THESE MORTALS

- Father Baird had his minions toss the blooddrained bodies of the captured acolytes here.
- Two of the acolytes (treat them as commoners), human female Mariel and male dwarf Naugrem, are still clinging to life. They are both on their final death saving throw.
- Roll initiative to keep track of time by the round as the characters react.


## DRAMATIC QUESTION

Can the characters save the living acolytes?

## DEVELOPMENT

- If revived, the acolytes speak with chattering teeth about the hooded sorcerer who slit their wrists and filled bowls with their blood. Then, the undead beasts dragged them here.
- The sorcerer wore a black robe, had a raspy voice, and his nails were falling out. His eyes glowed with the same green as the undead.


## AREA 5: COLLAPSED MAUSOLEUM

- A pit in the corner of this cavern houses a gibbering, wounded ghoul that has fallen in and can't escape. Its eyes burn with green fire. It tries to climb by bracing itself against the sides, showing unusual intelligence, but its wounds keep it from progressing.
- A ruptured mausoleum sits half-open in the collapsing wall. The narrow, stone coffins inside have all recently been torn open.


## Treasure

A dusty cache of $\mathbf{1 5 0}$ gold pieces stamped with the profile of a forgotten Azarummian lich-queen lies piled at the back of the mausoleum. A bubbling Potion of Gaseous Form sits among the coins.
![img-2.jpeg](Crypts%20of%20Azarumme%20Print%20Friendly%20V3_img-2.jpeg)

## TRANSITION

Go to Down The Well if the characters return to the well in Area 1, or Crypt of the Fallen if they take the tunnel to Area 4.

---

## CRYPT OF THE FALLEN

## AREA 6: GLOWING CAVERN

- A hooded sorcerer stands over a guttering brazier boiling with green fire.
- Four swaying ghouls stare in thrall at the emerald-eyed skull inside brazier. Piercing whispers emanate from it in a vile language.
- Shattered mausoleums loom around the edges of the cavern. Green flashes reflect inside the tombs like cat eyes.
- Four statues encircle the brazier. Blood spills from the full bowls in their hands, tracing lines to the sputtering brazier.
- Sinkholes dot the uneven floor.


## DEVELOPMENT

- The sorcerer, who is Father Baird, hears the characters coming if they don't make an effort to be stealthy. He prepares by summoning three green-eyed skeletons.
- Father Baird takes sick delight in revealing that he is the priest the group seeks.
- If the characters show any aggression, Father Baird snaps his rotting fingers and the ghouls spring to attention. Go to the Combat section.


## Other Baird, LE human

"St. Terragnis orders you to abandon this dark place, my children. Leave us to rot. Come now, will you defy our saint's holy commands?"

- Appearance. Short. Thin beard and delicate features. Nails blackened and dying. Eyes burning with green marsh-light.
- Does. Smiles twitchily and admonishes the group to heed St. Terragnis's "commands."
- Secret. Feared the growing power and divine favor Tibalt was showing.


## Sidebar: The Whisperskull

- The Whisperskull is a relic the Azarummian sorcerers used to raise undead armies. A burning emerald glows in the cyclopean skull's lone eye socket. Fell secrets leech from its hollows in an echoing whisper.
- While the Whisperskull does not have specific game statistics, the scope and nature of its abilities can be defined by the GM. For the purposes of this adventure, it grants its bonded wielder lair actions and the power to animate unusually intelligent undead.
- The Whisperskull has an AC of $\mathbf{1 4}$ and $\mathbf{3 0}$ hit points. Its effects end if destroyed.


## DRAMATIC QUESTION

Can the characters defeat Father Baird?

## COMBAT

-Father Baird uses his lair action to summon three skeletons. He casts spirit guardians on his first turn, staying out of melee range and in cover as long as possible.

- The four ghouls grapple characters who get close to Father Baird and drag them along for a shared fall down the sinkholes.
- Father Baird panics if anyone attacks the Whisperskull. He focuses guiding bolts on those individuals.


## Treasure

The emerald inside the Whisperskull is worth 200 gp (it becomes mundane if the Whisperskull is destroyed).

## TRANSITION

Go to Down The Well if the characters return to Area 1, or Twisting Catacombs if they take the tunnels to Areas 4 and 5. If the characters have defeated Father Baird, they can move on to the Aftermath section.

---

## AFTERMATH

## WHO WILL RUN THE CHURCH?

- Without Father Baird, the Church of St. Terragnis is without concrete leadership. If Tibalt is alive, he volunteers to be the interim priest, but his training isn't complete. The characters may devise a plan to help with this situation.
- Tibalt or another member of the church makes sure the characters are paid $\mathbf{1 0 0} \mathbf{g p}$ each for their help in the catacombs. The clergy will also fulfill a boon for each character (within reason).

THE WHISPERSKULL

- Characters who want to use the Whisperskull instead of destroy it may make gains in the short term, but the skull's ill effects are inescapable in the long term. In this situation, the GM is encouraged to create specific positive and negative effects for the Whisperskull. If the characters use it, they draw the attention of more powerful parties, both good and evil.


## FUTURE ADVENTURE HOOKS

- The group may decide to seek out further information or treasures from the Azarummian empire.
- Tibalt may ask the party to deliver the news about Father Baird to the Bishop of the church of St. Terragnis, requiring travel through dangerous territory.
-The characters may be called upon to help find a new priest to lead the Church of St. Terragnis, or to lead it themselves during the search for a new priest.
-The Whisperskull in this crypt may not have been the only one left in the world...

## APPENDIX B: NEW MONSTERS

## Reginald Baird

Father Reginald Baird is a thin, middle-aged man with hollow cheekbones and a twitching smile. He was once a man of conviction, preaching the word of St. Terragnis with the stoic duty espoused by his god.
Dangerous Knowledge. Father Baird focused on the study of arcane magic and artifacts during his tutelage as a priest of St. Terragnis, rather than the more typical healing and medicinal arts. While his superiors found his interests odd, they also believed broad knowledge among the clergy would cement the church's influence as a source of wisdom and guidance. They didn't realize Baird's fascination with the arcane bordered on obsession.
Tempt Them Slowly. Once Father Baird gained the independence of his own church and flock, he was able to study necromancy in secret. Over the years, his intellectual curiosity in the dark arts gave way to an insatiable thirst for potent secrets. St. Terragnis taught self-control, duty, and the acceptance of discomfort. Necromancy, on the other hand, taught the furious, self-indulgent denial of Father Baird's greatest fear - cold death itself. When the Whisperskull called to him from beneath his own church, he knew it was a sign from the tenebrous gods that his destiny had come.
