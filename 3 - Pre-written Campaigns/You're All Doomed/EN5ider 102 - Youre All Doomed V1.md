AN ABANDONED WIZARD'S TOWER
resting atop a hill. A peaceful village threatened by undead creatures. Whispered rumors of a vast treasure buried in long forgotten crypts. Sounds like the perfect start to an adventure. A little too perfect, even.

## INTRODUCTION

What if everything the PCs encountered here was a lie? The village in peril, the wizard's tower, and the promise of an ancient treasure; all of it set up and presented to the PCs like a trail of breadcrumbs. All of it eventually leading to their deaths, orchestrated by a powerful manipulator: a literal master of dungeons. She lures adventurers with the promise of gold and glory, then chooses an assortment of monsters to challenge them. She leads them down to the dungeon, allows them a glimpse of treasure, then unceremoniously slaughters them. Her role is to remind them that death is not reserved only for monsters underground.

This is the setup of "You're All Doomed!" It's a deviously meta dungeon delve masquerading as a bog-standard fantasy adventure. Before running it, think back to (or rewatch) Joss Whedon's Cabin in the Woods, as well as films like Westworld and Dead and Buried.

Before running this adventure, make sure your players are okay with being toyed with a little, and are genre-savvy enough to spot the subtle and not-so-subtle clues that inform this adventure and its big twist. If you or your players want a less deadly adventure, run this adventure for PCs of 8 th to 1oth level instead.

## BACKGROUND

## The Old One Arrives

Thousands of years ago, prior to the recorded history of some races, something fell from the sky. A godling; a vast, unknowable being from beyond the stars, terribly ancient yet little more than a fetus. This Old One lodged itself within the soft,
fertile soil of a valley. Its thoughts were powerful enough to distort reality around it.

Only when this Old One slept was the valley on the surface safe.

## The Founding of Lightvale

Less than a thousand years ago, two adventurous sisters happened upon this valley. Bellatrix Lightvale, a cunning ranger and trapper, and Morgotha Lightvale, a learned and experienced magic-user. It wasn't long until they witnessed the horrors that the Old One's thoughts could cause.

Morgotha, using her scrying magic, gleaned what she could from glimpses at the Old One's mind. The exposure to it left her crippled: her hair and teeth fell out, her organs shriveled up. She revealed that actions in the valley leaked into the Old One's dreams, and it could be kept slumbering if those dreams pleased it.

What pleased the Old One was the death: death within the sight of victory, hopes and dreams suddenly and violently snuffed out.

Morgotha and Bellatrix knew this kind of death well, recalling fellow dungeon delvers killed by fiendish traps and hideous monsters. This was the kind of death the two sisters schemed to arrange. Over the next fifty years they spun a tale of a wondrous treasure (the witch gauntlet) hidden beneath the valley. In truth, all that awaited treasure seekers were monsters and traps.

The sisters created a village and named it after themselves: Lightvale. To outsiders, it was a peaceful hamlet beleaguered by monsters, and with fabulous riches buried beneath it. In truth, it was a cunning death trap. Adventurers were lead to a tower on the hill, where they were mercilessly killed. Their blood ran down into the earth, and their deaths kept the Old One dreaming.

## The Dungeon Evolves

Over time, the sisters grew old and feeble. Morgotha felt they were unable to continue to keep the Old One dreaming.

Bellatrix had many children who could act as heirs to their will. They could continue their mother and aunt's work of luring adventurers to their deaths. Satisfied with this, Bellatrix finally succumbed to old age and died.

Morgotha could not accept this. No one else could understand the threat of the Old One as she did. She alone had glimpsed its vast, pulsating mind and lived. She could not die while it still existed. Morgotha engaged in the necromantic rites to extend her existence into undeath, becoming a lich. In this way, she could act as the unseen master of the tower dungeon and continue their work from the shadows. She was content to let Bellatrix die and be remembered as the heroic village founder, while she lived on to keep the Old One slumbering.

Under her immortal gaze, the wizard's tower expanded underground. A dungeon level that housed the witch gauntlet, and a secret level below to keep the menagerie of monsters they'd been collecting locked up. Morgotha's extensive knowledge of teleportation magic made sure that she could safely move both people and creatures to and from places all over the valley.

Today, Lightvale Valley is a well-oiled machine that tempts adventurers and sellswords from all across the country, then kills them underground in order to preserve the Old One's slumber.

## Character Hooks

If your players aren't used to old-school adventures with a high risk of character death, be sure to use the "Missing Relative" adventure hook. This will clue players in that there's something amiss in Lightvale Village, and they'll arrive in the region skeptical and suspicious.

- The Witch Gauntlet. This fabled treasure has been talked about in adventuring communities for years. It is rumored to have
the ability to rip open tears to the afterlife, and restore those who have died to life. No one has ever taken it from its supposed resting place below the wizard's tower in Lightvale Valley.
- Zombie Troubles. A call for aid has been put out by the Mayor of Lightvale Village. The village has been attacked by the walking dead several times over the past few weeks, and only at night. The mayor promises a 500 gp reward to anyone who can destroy undead abominations lurking in the surrounding woods.
- Missing Relative. An adventurous older relative of one of the player characters has gone missing. This relative is the same class as the PC, but of a higher level. The last place they were seen was Lightvale Village, looking for information on the witch gauntlet. One week ago, the PC received a sending spell from their older relative that read "I'm trapped down here! Send help fast! They're hiding something. Lightvale isn't-." The sending is cut off before the message is complete.


## Adventure Synopsis

The adventure begins with the player characters arriving in Lightvale Valley. If you want to start the game off with some roleplaying, have the players characters arrive at Lightvale Village. If you want to start things off with some action, start play with the "Escaped Zombies" random encounter detailed below.

No matter what length of time the PCs spend in town, the villagers steer them towards the wizard's tower to the north with folktales of the witch gauntlet or pleas for help to find abducted villagers being held captive there by monsters. If the PCs show no signs of wanting to venture towards the tower, some villagers offer to buy them a drink in the tavern. This drink is poisoned and will render anyone who drinks it unconscious unless they succeed on a DC 25 Constitution

---

saving throw. Once the PCs are knocked out, the villagers transport them to a summoning circle, which warps them to Area 17 of the dungeon. The villagers will not directly attack or kill the PCs in broad daylight, no matter how much they are provoked.

If the PCs explore the surrounding area, roll for random encounters. These encounters are meant to challenge, but also to drop hints about the odd nature of the area. Savvy players should know that something is amiss by the time they arrive at the wizard's tower.

The wizard's tower is a straight-forward dungeon crawl filled with lethal traps. PCs who survive long enough to get to the witch gauntlet in the Dungeon Level should be able to locate the secret door that leads to the bottommost level of the dungeon. From there, the true nature of the dungeon, and the entire valley, is revealed.

By the conclusion of the adventure, the PCs will be faced with a number of choices, each with their own consequences. See the Conclusion section for more details.

## Region of Lightvale Valley

Lightvale Valley is a $14 \times 14$-mile area surrounded by dense forest. It lies on the northern borderland of civilization; the dirt road connecting it to other towns and villages to the south has grown over.

- Play starts at the south of the map, roughly 4 miles south of Lightvale Village. If you want to speed things up, or get your players interacting with the NPCs sooner, have them start play just outside of Lightvale Village.
- The valley is steep. Each hillside rises almost a mile up. Overland travel up the hills takes twice as long as normal.
- The forested areas are extremely dense. The trees grow within feet of each other and make passing through the forest difficult. PCs must make a successful DC 15 Dexterity (Nature) check each mile they travel through the forest in order to move at normal speed.


## RANDOM EnCOUNTERS

Roll 1d20 for every hex/mile the PCs travel on the Lightvale Valley map. When traveling at night, roll 2d20 and use the higher result. When subjected to speak with animals or speak with dead, all encountered monsters are aware of and can describe the tower dungeon to the amount that their intelligence allows.

## RANDOM ENCOUNTER TABLE

## 1d20 Result

1-10 No encounter.
11-13 1d4 village scouts pretending to be travelling either to or from the village. In actuality they are spying on the PCs and tracking their movements.
14 1d6 escaped zombie humans wandering around.
15 2d6 skeletons. A DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals that their weapons are in almost perfect condition, unlike their bones.
16 1d4 giant spiders. At half hit points, the spider(s) retreat towards whichever teleportation circle on the map is nearest to them. If they get there before the PCs do, a villager spy is waiting for them and teleports them and herself to the Monster Chamber (Area 30). The spiders do not attack the villager.
17 A young red dragon. This dragon is actually a polymorphed mastiff. Every time it is damaged it must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. Failure causes it to revert back to its dog form. The dragon acts obviously like a dog, not a dragon.
18 An owlbear. The owlbear is frightened and confused, having just been released from its cell. A DC 10 Intelligence (Nature) check reveals that owlbears are not native to this part of the country, and it is strange to find one here.
19 A wyvern. A DC 10 Intelligence (Nature) check reveals that wyverns are not native to this part of the country, and it is strange to find one here.
20 A spirit naga (day) or vampire spawn (night). These creatures are loyal to Morgotha and are willingly working with her to kill adventurers. They attack the PCs, then lead them towards the wizard's tower. Only once the PCs have gone inside the tower will they outright kill them.

## Teleportation Circles

Morgotha is an accomplished spellcaster, and has devised a series of permanent teleportation circles that allow easy passage from the valley to the cells in the tower dungeon. She and the numerous villagers use them to transport caught monsters and supplies down to the dungeon, as well as release said monsters at appropriate times.

- There are 5 teleportation circles marked on the map, as well as one hidden within Lightvale Village, and several within the tower dungeon. Each one is a 10 -foot diameter ring of stone and crystal.
- The circles are covered up with green tarps covered with grass. It takes a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check to notice them. The circles radiate conjuration magic.
- A command phrase and specified destination are required to use the teleportation circles. The command phrase is "As it ever will be," and must be followed by a stated location of a teleportation circle. The location described can be vague ("Northwest circle" or "circle by the tower" or "The Dungeon" will do), but is required. If only the command phrase is spoken, the magic teleports those within the circle automatically to the Monster Chamber (Area 30).
- Except for the children, all of the villager NPCs know the command phrase and how to use the teleportation circles.
- The teleportation circles can be bypassed with magical skill, but not easily. Activating a teleportation circle without the command phrase requires proficiency in Arcana and a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check. Doing so creates a link between that circle and the circle in the Monster Chamber (Area 30). However, there is only a $60 \%$ chance of success by taking this route. Any PC that teleports this way must make a d10o roll. Those who roll 61 or higher are instead teleported into one of the locked (and occupied) monster cells.


## Lightvale Village

Founded hundreds of years ago by Bellatrix Lightvale, this village appears welcoming and accommodating to adventurous life. Its village square is lined with shops and vendors geared specifically to sellswords or mercenaries. It definitely appears too good to be true to the casual observer (because it is!).

The village is a façade. Its adult villagers are trained in subterfuge and deception, and are merely posing as ordinary farmers, merchants, and peasants. All of them except for the young children are in on the ruse, though they all have differing levels of understanding when it comes to the details of their secret, and what lays dormant beneath their village.

- There are 50 villagers in total. All of them are human.
- All of them have a +6 bonus to Charisma (Deception) rolls. They try to hide their level of skill, as well as their class abilities, if present. To adventurers, they try to appear as "extremely average villagers."
- All of them have varying levels of training and expertise, but all of them are armed. If questioned about them carrying weapons, they laugh and smile and say "Well, these are dangerous times, what with monsters and villains roaming about."
- All of them know how to use the region's teleportation circles and can use them with ease.


## Rumors, Gossip, and Strange Observations

By talking to the villagers, or just observing the surroundings of the village, players can glean some information about the village itself, and the surrounding area. A DC 10 Charisma or Wisdom check prompts a roll on the Rumor Table below.

## 1d12 Rumor or Observation

1-4 "We've been attacked by the walking dead these past few nights. They dragged off one of our villagers, Krista. We think we saw her being dragged north towards that old wizard's tower! We can pay you 500 gp to kill these monsters and save our Krista!"

5 "Everyone here knows there's a treasure hidden somewhere up in that wizard's tower: the witch gauntlet! It's said to grant wishes, or eternal life, or something! We're all too scared to explore that place, but surely you strong, brave adventurers could handle it."

6 "Our farmers have spotted strange wolves that walk upright in the woods to the north! How horrid! We need someone brave to put an end to them."

7 "Have you ever seen a dragon? Every so often we see one fly overhead. It must have a lair somewhere in the region, but we're all too scared to take a look."

8 You notice that all the villagers seem to be keeping a close eye on you. You don't know why, but they seem overly polite and helpful.

9 You notice that every so often a villager will nod to a group of others, then quickly head to the Inn.
10 If in the inn, you notice a strange light coming from the door that leads to the basement. If not, you notice the light coming from the inn's outside cellar door.

11 You overhear the villagers talking about someone called Morgotha.
12 A child says something about a 'big stone circle on the hill to the south', but their parents quickly hush them up, looking to see if you overheard them.

## Notable Village Shops and Locations

Lightvale Village boasts a large number of stores that sell goods and tools common to adventurers. However, everything sold to adventurers in Lightvale Village is substandard, ineffective, or both. However, everything sold has the appearance of being high quality, and holds up to a certain level of scrutiny. A DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals the actual flimsy quality of the goods.

- Unicorn Trading Post. Has a bright, colorful unicorn sign. This store sells most common items found in the Core Rulebook. Rope sold here will fray and snap if put under the stress of holding the weight of more than one medium sized creature. 10-foot poles snap after being used to push or prod anything more than once. Lantern oil stays lit for half as long as normal, as do torches.
- Blackbarrel Blacksmith. Sells martial arms and armor. Has an assortment of supposedly enchanted " +1 weapons and shields." In truth, they are merely enchanted to glimmer and shine, giving them the appearance of magical items.
- Evergreen Apothecary. Filled with the pungent smell of fungi and vinegar. Sells spell components and several kinds of mundane magic potions. Neither work. The potions are just sugar water that's been enchanted so it registers as magical when detect magic is used.
- Waypoint Inn \& Tavern. A two-story building with a basement, this is the local watering hole and unofficial center of the village. A large portrait of Bellatrix Lightvale is hung above the hearth. Ordinary wine, ale, and food is served in the tavern for rural prices. Rooms are available on the upper floor to rent for standard rural prices. There is a hidden teleportation circle in the basement that connects directly to the lowest level of the tower dungeon.


## Wizard's Tower

The wizard tower is roughly 8 miles from Lightvale Village. All of the villagers know where it is, but they all say that they avoid it. They consider being close to it to be bad luck.

This dungeon is divided up into three main levels:

- Tower Level. This is the facade that exists to draw adventurers in. The tower is old and crumbling human architecture. Its main building looks almost like a chapel, with a steep tiled roof. The tower portion rises up two levels above the main building; its conical roof sags from age.
- Dungeon Level. This is where adventurers are caught, trapped, and killed. The many rooms and hallways on this level are deathtraps. The whole area is suffused in magical energy and misleading signs. This is also where the fabled 'witch gauntlet' rests.
- Secret Level. This Morgotha Lightvale's true lair, where she lives, studies, and conducts her magical experiments. The level is devoid of traps. Magically guarded cells contain monsters of all shapes and sizes, each ready to be teleported to circles that dot the region and fill the above dungeon level. If there is truth to be found about her and the Old One, it is found here.


## Tower Level Features

- Ceilings. Unless otherwise stated, all ceilings are 15 feet high.
- Doors. The doors are all wooden with iron hinges and handles. All except for the entrance doors in Area 1 are unlocked.
- Stairs. The stairs in the tower portion are stone and spiral around the walls. There is no railing.
- Windows. There are several windows all throughout the tower. Each is 10 feet off the ground, three feet high and 1 foot wide. There is no glass in these windows.

---

- Light. During the day the tower is well lit. At night it is pitch black. There are several wooden chandeliers hanging from the ceiling. All of their candles are missing.
- Traps. There are several traps in this part of the dungeon. Unless otherwise stated they require a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14 to notice. Anyone can make a DC 12 Dexterity check as an action to disarm them.
- Secret Doors. An "S" on the map indicates a secret door. This door requires a DC 18 Wisdom (Perception) or DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check to locate. Opening this door requires an action.


## Tower Numbered Areas

## 1. Foyer

- 25 feet wide, 30 feet long.
- The double doors that provide entry to this room are barred from the inside. They can be broken open with a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check, or the bar can be lifted by jamming something thin through the gap between the two doors.
- This room is empty save for a skeleton in rusted plate armor that's curled up at the back. The skeleton is unarmed, but clutches a piece of parchment that has written in Common "The witch gauntlet lies below. It is here!"
- Closely examining the skeleton with a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals that this person has been dead for over a hundred years, but the parchment note is can't be older than a few years.


## 2. Altar Room

- Roughly 10 feet wide, 15 feet long.
- Three pairs of faded and torn holy vestments hang on hooks on the wall. A stone altar to a sun god, complete with an offering basin, rests against the opposite wall.
- The altar has been enchanted with a spell that answers any prayers or offerings with a
spoken message, "Holy warrior, you are now blessed and protected." This message repeats with every prayer/offering given. If done more than five times, the message skips and warbles, and the magic dissipates. No actual bonus or protection is given.


## 3. Basin Room

- Roughly 10 feet wide, 15 feet long.
- A large basin filled with water dominates this room. The basin holds several gallons of what appears to be fresh, clean water.
- The water is safe to drink, and does not detect as anything magical or evil. However, doing so creates a laxative effect in the drinker that takes effect 10 minutes after drinking. The victim must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute, in addition to suffering from its "other effects" for the next hour. A DC 20 Intelligence (Medicine) check reveals this check reveals this effect. That this water is still fresh after so long is also suspicious.


## 4. Tower Hallway

- 5 feet wide, 10 feet long.
- This room is empty.


## 5. Main Tower Room

- Semi-circular, 25 feet $\times 25$ feet.
- Human bones and rusted swords/knives litter the floor of this room.
- Stone stairs lead up to the second level tower above.
- There is a trap door in the center of the room. It is locked with an easily smashed/unlocked rusted padlock. The trapdoor drops down $50^{\prime}$ to the dungeon level below. It is a sheer drop to Area 14 below.


## 6. 2nd Floor Tower Hall

- Semi-circular, roughly 25 feet $\times 15$ feet.
- Stone stairs lead up to the third level tower above.
- Affixed to the wall is an enormous portrait

---

painting of Bellatrix Lightvale. Her piercing eyes are enough to intimidate even the bravest warrior. Touching or jostling the painting in any way triggers a magical trap. A disintegration ray fires from behind the painting. The person who triggered it must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking iod8 force damage on a failure. If this damage reduces the person to o hit points, they are instantly killed and reduced to a pile of fine grey dust as the disintegrate spell.

## 7. 2nd Floor Hallway

- 5 feet wide, 10 feet long.
- Trap. Stepping into this hallway triggers a hidden trap door, dropping all within that five-foot square 15 ' to the room below, taking 1d6 points of falling damage. A creature can grab onto the sides of the floor by making a successful DC 16 Dexterity saving throw.


## 8. Men's Water Closet

- Roughly 10 feet $\times 10$ feet.
- A basin of water, stool, and a chamber pot. A small shelf holds dusty cakes of soap.


## 9. Women's Water Closet

- Roughly 10 feet $\times 10$ feet.
- A basin of water, stool, and a chamber pot. A small shelf holds dusty cakes of soap.
- Scratched into the stone wall in common are the words "The treasure is above! Save us all!"


## 10. 3rd Floor Tower Hall

- Roughly 20 feet wide, 10 feet long.
- This hall is empty.


## 11. Sitting Room

- Roughly 10 feet wide, 15 feet long.
- A small table and three chairs occupy this room. A small hearth and an empty shelf line the walls.
- Trap. On top of the table is a china teapot painted with an intricate design. Lifting
the teapot, disturbing it, or opening its lid triggers a magical explosion of knives. Anyone within 15 feet of the teapot must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, targets take 1od4 points of slashing damage as dozens of daggers explode outwards; half damage on a successful save.


## 12. Wizard's Bedroom

- Roughly 10 feet wide, 15 feet long.
- A work table, bookshelf, and single bed occupy this room. The walls are canvassed in magical schematics and diagrams, all written in cyphered magical script. A DC 25 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals them to be non-magical nonsense, crafted to appear interesting and complex.
- On the bookshelf are an assortment of books on the subject of spell research, histories of the region, and extraplanar lore. There are 20 books in total, each one is worth 50 gp to the right collector.
- Trap. There are also four spellbooks tucked in the bookshelf among the other books. All of them are labelled "Archmage Grimoire." Flipping through the books to examine their contents triggers a curse. Book-handlers must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On failure, their Constitution score is reduced by 1 d 4 , or half as much on a successful save. Creatures regain 1 point of Constitution after each long rest.
- There is a secret door in the wall that leads to the next room.


## 13. Secret Transport Room

- 5 feet wide, 15 feet long.
- This secret room contains a shelf with five trapped teapots and six trapped spellbooks (see Areas 11 and 12). Three copies of the portrait of Bellatrix Lightvale rest against the wall.
- There is also a smaller $5^{\prime} \times 5^{\prime}$ teleportation circle etched into the stone floor. It works the same as the other teleportation circles.

---

## Dungeon Level Features

- Ceilings. Unless otherwise stated, all ceilings are 10 feet high.
- Doors. The doors are all sturdy iron with iron hinges and handles. Unless otherwise stated, all of the doors are unlocked.
- Light. Unless otherwise stated, all of the rooms on this level are pitch black.
- Traps. There are numerous traps in this part of the dungeon. Unless otherwise stated they require a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 16 to notice. As an action, anyone can make a DC 14 Dexterity check to disarm them, or a DC 14 Intelligence (Arcana) check if they are magical.
- Secret Doors. An "S" on the map indicates a secret door. This door requires a DC 18 Wisdom (Perception) or DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check to locate. Opening this door takes an action.


## Dungeon Numbered Areas

## 14. Dungeon Level Entrance

- 20 feet wide, 15 feet long.
- This room is 50 . feet down from the trap door above that leads to Room 5 .
- There are six doors leading away from this room. All of them have symbols carved into their stone arches:
- Door to Area 15 has a crescent moon.
- Door to Area 16 has a howling wolf.
- Door to Area 18 has a gauntlet with a pentagram.
- Door to Area 19 has a lion's face.
- Door to Area 20 has a shining sun.
- Door to Area 21 has an hourglass.


## 15. Crescent Moon Room

- 10 feet $\times 10$ feet.
- This room is magically darkened, as if under the conditions of a darkness spell.
- The door to Area 17 is false. It doesn't open.
- Trap. There is a tripwire in the middle of the room. If tripped over, all the doors in this
room swing shut, and the opposite walls push inward to crush anyone inside. The walls move within 1 round, and deal 8d6 bludgeoning damage before resetting.


## 16. Howling Wolf Room

- 10 feet $\times 10$ feet.
- This room is empty save for two stuffed dire wolf heads that hang on the walls, facing each other. The door to Area 17 is magically locked and impassible.
- Each wolf has one eye that is a gem. The wolf to the east has a sapphire, and the wolf to the west has a ruby. Popping these gems out an exchanging them causes the door to Room 17 to open. Each gem is worth 70 gp . If both gems are taken but not exchanged/ reinserted within 5 minutes, the dire wolf heads animate and attack. They have the same statistics as a dire wolf, but have a speed of 10 feet (awkwardly hopping) and are undead. Reinserting the gems into their eye sockets or reducing them to o hit points ceases their animation.


## 17. Summoning Room

- 30 feet wide, 15 feet long.
- In the east corner of the room is an illusory pile of treasure. It looks to be over 50,000 gp of gold and silver coins. Touching it in any way causes the illusion to disappear.
- There is a teleportation circle on the west side of the room. Entering the room causes the dog that's been polymorphed into a young red dragon (see "Random Encounters") to be teleported in. The dragon attacks anyone nearby.


## 18. Trapped Gauntlet Hallway

- 5 feet wide, 20 feet long.
- At the end of this hallway is a pedestal with a golden gauntlet resting atop it. The gauntlet is a gold-plated tin gauntlet worth 60 gp .
- Trap. Removing the gauntlet from the pedestal causes the door of this room to

---

swing shut and lock (a DC 25 Strength check can break down the door, a DC 20 Dexterity check to pick the lock). The room immediately heats up like an oven, becoming blisteringly hot and dry. Every round, creatures within this room must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 5 d 6 fire damage on a failure or half as much on a successful save. The gold-plated tin gauntlet automatically fails this save. If it takes 20 points of fire damage or more, it melts.

## 19. Lion Hallway

- 5 feet wide, 20 feet long.
- Appears to be an ordinary empty stone hallway.
- Trap. If all of the PCs venture down this hallway, randomly determine one of them. This selected PC hears frightful lion roars as they move through the hallway. They must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or be deafened for 10 minutes, and must make a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or be being frightened of its source for 10 minutes.


## 20. Sun Hallway

- 5 feet wide, 20 feet long.
- Appears to be an ordinary empty stone hallway.
- Trap. There is a tripwire in the middle of the room. If walked through, the walls, floor, and ceiling of this hall magically become blindingly bright. All creatures within the room who can see must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw to avoid being blinded for 1 hour.
- If the PCs try to wait out their blindness in the dungeon, 2d6 skeletons are teleported from the Secret Level to Room 17. These skeletons immediately seek out the PCs.


## 21. Time Hallway

- 5 feet wide, 20 feet long.
- Appears to be an ordinary empty stone hallway.
- Trap. This hallway has been ensorcelled with powerful entropic magic. The whole hallway is surrounded by an aura of necromancy. Any creature that passes through this hallway must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. Failure causes that creature to wither and dry up, as if being rapidly aged, reducing their Constitution score by 1 d 8 points, or half as much on a successful save. Creatures whose Constitution scores are reduced to o instantly die of old age. Creatures regain 1 point of Constitution after each long rest.


## 22. Bloodletting Hall

- 20 feet wide, 10 feet long.
- All three doors are locked. The doors to Areas 23, 24, and 25 are impassible unless a sacrifice is made (see below). The other door can be smashed open or picked open with a DC 20 Strength check.
- In the center of this room is an altar, upon which rests a stone basin and a ceremonial bone dagger. The walls are decorated with mosaics which depict warriors and mages standing before the basin. One by one, it shows them using the ceremonial dagger to cut off their left hands. Finally, it depicts a door opening, and one of the warriors passing through it and placing the witch gauntlet onto their bloodied arm stump. The doors to Area 23 are decorated with symbols of the witch gauntlet.
- Investigating the mosaics closely reveals that the way forward to the witch gauntlet will only open if half of the people present surrender their left hands. There's no rounding up or down. If there is an odd number of people, the basin requires half of a hand from someone. Once the hands are placed in the basin, both impassible doors unlock.
- Note: Unless you have a house rule of your own for limb loss/amputation, cutting off a hand deals 1d2o damage.

## 23. False Gauntlet Chamber

- 20 feet $\times 20$ feet.
- The stone of this chamber is polished and white. It is empty save for a gleaming white stone pedestal at the back of it, on which rests a gleaming gold gauntlet with rubies inlaid in the back of the hand.
- Trap. The gauntlet is illusory, projected by the magic in the room. Any creature that touches or disturbs the gauntlet in any way causes lightning to spring across the floor and walls. It deals 6d8 lightning damage to all within the room. Creatures wearing metal armor take double damage.


## 24. True Gauntlet Chamber

- 10 feet wide, 30 feet long.
- At the end of this plain stone chamber is an obsidian pedestal with an open golden chest upon it. The chest is lined in velvet, and nestled inside of it is a golden gauntlet decorated with pentagrams. The gauntlet has an aura of abjuration magic.
- Trap. There is an invisible 5 foot $\times 5$ foot teleportation circle in the corner of the corner of the room. If the gauntlet is disturbed, a vampire spawn is teleported in from the Secret Level below. The PC are surprised, and the vampire spawn attacks. If the PCs run or when the vampire spawn is reduced to half health, four ghouls are teleported to the room they are in from the Secret Level below.
- The gold chest is worth 5,000 gp alone. The witch gauntlet is an ordinary (though ornate) steel gauntlet that has been gold plated. It is worth 1000 gp . It has been enchanted to detect as magical, but it has no magical properties. The gauntlet itself is trapped. If a creature sticks their hand inside of the gauntlet or attempts to wear it, a hidden runestone within the gauntlet explodes, sending gold and steel shrapnel out in a wave. Anyone within 20 feet of the gauntlet
must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, creatures take 5 d 6 points of piercing damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. The creature wearing the gauntlet takes maximum damage (30 piercing damage).


## 25. Body Hallway

- 10 feet wide, 30 feet long.
- There is a secret door in the far wall that leads to Area 26.
- This room is full of dozens of skeletons and bodies, heaped all over the ground. They are all in various states of decomposition; some are less than a month old, others are clearly hundreds of years old. Most are wearing some kind of armor and gear, but it's all rotted away. Scrawled in chalk on the wall is message in Common that reads "STAY OUT! IT'S DEADLY! SAVE YOURSELVES!"
- Investigating the room reveals that the chalk message is fresh, and can't be more than a few days old. All of the bodies have rusted weapons and armor, but all of their valuables and consumables have been taken. If you have used the "Missing Relative" adventure hook, the missing relative's body is at the back of the room, their hand pressing against the secret door that leads to Area 26. They appear to have been stabbed to death. Moving them or turning them over reveals a small blood trail that leads to the secret door.


## 26. Secret Passage

- 10 feet wide, 5 feet long.
- The secret door slides away to reveal a secret passage. There is a trapdoor that leads to a 70 -foot-long shaft. The shaft has an iron ladder in it, and leads down to the Secret Level below.
- Making excess noise in this room alerts the three villager spies working in the rooms below.

---

## Secret Level Features

- Ceilings. Unless otherwise stated, all ceilings are 20 feet high.
- Doors. The doors are all sturdy iron with iron hinges and handles. Unless otherwise stated, all of the doors are unlocked.
- Light. All rooms are well lit by iron sconces with torches that line the walls. There are also several lanterns and candelabras in every room.
- Magical Cells. The monster cells in Area 31 are shut by magical force fields. These force fields are impenetrable from the inside, but can be disturbed or broken through more easily from the outside. If a cell door takes 16 points of damage, it fizzles out and disappears. Likewise, casting dispel magic destroys all force fields within range.


## Secret Level Numbered Areas

## 27. Secret Level Storage

- 15 feet wide, 10 feet long.
- This room is filled with shelves and barrels. Within the barrels are a variety of spell components, as well as seven copies of the "witch gauntlet" from Area 17, and four copies of the "witch gauntlet" from Area 24 (untrapped).


## 28. Prep Area

- 20 feet wide, 10 feet long.
- This room contains several work tables and chairs. A magical display projected onto the wall shows a full map of the tower dungeon, as well as indicators of which traps have been sprung and which teleportation circles are active. Six sets of plate armor adorn the opposite wall, as well as a sign that reads "Protection against monsters. Please return all pieces of armor to this room before leaving this level. DO NOT WALK ON THE DUNGEON LEVEL WITHOUT A PROTECTION STONE."
- Three villager spies are sitting in this room, watching the PCs progress. If the PCs look like they are approaching this room, two of the villagers don the plate armor (increasing their AC to 18) and are ready to attack. The third goes to warn Morgotha in Area 32.
- Scattered on the various tables are 10 'protection stones'. These smooth, palm sized stones have been enchanted so that they disarm/neutralize all the traps in the dungeon within 30 feet of the stones. This allows the villagers to move through all levels of the dungeon unharmed.


## 29. Rest Area

- 15 feet wide, 10 feet long.
- This room has cots and chamber pots lined against the walls. On the wall is a wooden placard with the following carved into it: "Many must die so that even more may live, free from the danger of what slumbers below. Do not feel guilt, remorse, or pity for those who enter this dungeon. They brought this upon themselves, and it is their time to suffer."


## 30. Monster Cell Chamber

- 15 feet wide, 60 feet long. Each cell is either 10 feet $\times 10$ feet, or 10 feet $\times 15$ feet.
- This darkened room is a prison for all the caught monsters. Each cell has one of the monsters listed in the Lightvale Valley Random Encounter Table in it. If the PCs have encountered one of these monsters before, the monster retains any damage it has previously taken. If a monster was killed, it is no longer present in the cell.
- Each cell contains one of the following monsters:
- 1d4 zombies
- 2d6 skeletons
- A wyvern
- A vampire spawn (their cell has a coffin and accommodations)
- 1d4 giant spiders

---

- An owlbear
- A spirit naga (her cell has soft bedding and pillows)
- A young red dragon (secretly a polymorphed dog)
- Any monsters that are released will target and attack Morgotha and any villager NPCs present. Most of them resent or hate their human masters, or at least would rather kill/ eat them than the PCs.


## 31. Morgotha's Lair

- Roughly 15' wide, 60' long.
- A combination of magical laboratory and throne room. There are five tables filled with spell components and magical workshop equipment. At the back of the room is an iron throne, upon which sits Morgotha Lightvale, a withered lich. There is also a teleportation circle in the middle of the room.
- Treasure. In the corner of the room is a large, locked safe (DC 25 Strength or Dexterity check to open). Inside are 100 platinum trade bars ( 500 gp each, 50,000 gp total) as well as a declaration signed by Morgotha and five other prominent nobles of the region. The declaration outlines their support for what Morgotha is doing, and their pledge to hide any knowledge of the slumbering Old One from the common people, the church, and the rest of the nobility. At the back of the safe is a jewel encrusted vial of blood ( 300 gp ), which acts as Morgotha's phylactery.
- Morgotha can't stomach killing the PCs herself-she had really hoped the traps and monsters would be enough. If Morgotha is alerted to the PCs presence, she sends out a magical message to the village, calling out for aid. Within 1d4 minutes, 12 villager thugs arrive through the teleportation circle to kill the PCs.
- If the players question Morgotha or attack her, see the 'Finale' section.


## FinALE

## What Morgotha Knows

Morgotha isn't stupid, and won't try to hide the true nature of the tower dungeon and her work. She speaks plainly and pleasantly to the PCs, and will explain everything covered in the "Adventure Background" section.

She urges the PCs to move to the Monster Cell Chamber and allow the monsters to kill them. She says the following.
"Only your death at the hands of danger and strife will satisfy the Old One's dreams, and keep it slumbering. If you do not die here, and you deny the Old One what it craves, you will inflict upon this world a terrible suffering. Please ... do the right thing and die here, knowing that your sacrifice protects the world."

If the PCs agree, they are brought to the Monster Cell Chamber and promptly killed. The Old One keeps sleeping, and the people of Lightvale Valley continue their dark work.

If the PCs refuse, Morgotha attacks them. She does not fight to the death. When reduced to half her hit points she retrieves her phylactery from the safe, then runs to the teleportation circle and teleports to Lightvale Village. If she gets away, she moves to the next town over and begins planning to retake the tower dungeon.

If Morgotha is killed, the villagers all run away, either to the nearby teleportation circle, or up the ladder to the Dungeon Level. The word is put out that Morgotha has died, and the rest of the people in Lightvale Village pack their things and leave the region as quickly as possible.

If the PCs survive the adventure and walk away from the dungeon, the larval Old One erupts from the earth 24 hours later. Add 24 hours for every PC that was killed during the adventure.

- If this adventure is part of an ongoing campaign, then the larval Old One persists as an ongoing threat that ravages the realm.
- If this adventure is a one-shot game, describe the larval Old One emerging from the

ground after the allotted time has passed. It lets out an unearthly baby's cry, and stops over to destroy the nearby village, then it moves on to destroy others. If your players want to fight it, by all means let them, but be clear that this thing is like an embryonic god, and that fighting it head on is almost certainly suicide.

- If the players choose not to fight it, and walk away from the situation, congratulate them on walking away from this adventure alive.
