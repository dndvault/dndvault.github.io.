# Chapter 1: A Tale of Two Cities

![](img/adventure/BGDIA/002-dbn8x-01-01.webp)

Baldur's Gate began as a harbor town where traders would meet with "ghost lighters"—folk along the Sword Coast who used lights to lure fogbound ships to shore. When those ships ran aground, the ghost lighters would scavenge the wrecks and haul their plundered goods to Baldur's Gate, nestled on the north shore of a bend in the River Chionthar, and sell their booty. In the years since, Baldur's Gate has grown into a walled city. Today, its foggy streets run red with the blood of unfortunates who fall prey to evil opportunists, many of whom count themselves as nobles, traders, pirates, and assassins. An army of mercenary soldiers called the Flaming Fist keeps order in the city, and these soldiers answer to Grand Duke **Ulder Ravengard**. The members of the Flaming Fist don't care about justice; they crave power and coin, nothing else. But despite the Fist's reputation for cruelty, the Grand Duke is widely regarded as an honorable and reasonable man.

The city of Elturel, capital of Elturgard, is located much farther inland along the River Chionthar. Whereas Baldur's Gate has a well-earned reputation for being a nest of vipers, Elturel is seen as a beacon of faith, order, and high culture. The two cities have endured a long, bitter rivalry that originated when Baldur's Gate began stealing cargo and coin from ships heading to and from Elturel, stifling that city's sea trade. Though the conflicts between Baldur's Gate and Elturel have always fallen short of open warfare, relations between the cities have been tense for a long time—too long, some would say.

## Vanthampur Villa

Vanthampur Villa is located in the Upper City, which is populated by the wealthiest residents of Baldur's Gate and heavily patrolled by the Watch. The villa's location is marked on *map 1.1*, while *map 1.5* shows its interior. The villa connects with the dungeon and sewer complex shown on *map 1.6*.

The characters might want to visit Vanthampur Villa after leaving the Dungeon of the Dead Three or paying a visit to **Amrik Vanthampur** at the Low Lantern. If they take Amrik prisoner, they can count on Reya Mantlemorn to keep a close eye on him.

### Getting to the Villa

Twenty **guards** of the Watch vigilantly are posted at every gate to the Upper City. If the characters present the badges given to them by Captain Zodge, the Watch members let them pass through the gates, even if they are accompanied by a prisoner or a known fugitive such as Reya Mantlemorn. Any character without a badge is questioned and required to pay a gate toll of 2 cp.

If the characters have Amrik as their prisoner, he does nothing to provoke a confrontation with the guards at the gate, fearing he might be hurt.

### The Vanthampur Family

Thalamra Vanthampur is a cunning, devil-worshiping beast of a woman in her late sixties who can stare down a hell hound without flinching. She is barrel-bodied, with strong hands and forearms that speak to her beginnings as a manual laborer. Her youth was spent in the cellars and sewers of Baldur's Gate, repairing pipes and clearing out the city's filth. Thalamra rose from such lowly work to become the minister of the city's sewers and waterworks. Now she dresses in the finery that suits her station as a duke of Baldur's Gate.

Thalamra orchestrated the disappearance of Grand Duke **Ulder Ravengard** to fulfill her ultimate goal of becoming the new grand duke of Baldur's Gate. When not engaged in political matters, she conducts her most secret business in the dungeon complex below her villa.

Thalamra is a widow three times over, and each of her dead husbands was kind enough to give her a son. Her oldest boy, Thurstwell, is a pale and sullen recluse in his forties. A veritable shut-in, he uses imps to spy on his brothers, Amrik and Mortlock. Thurstwell resents both of them—Amrik for being their mother's favorite, and Mortlock for being a monstrous dolt.

Thurstwell's real problem is that his mother doesn't see him as her successor, and is grooming Amrik to fill that role. Despite his jealousy, Thurstwell would never visit harm upon Amrik for fear of incurring his mother's wrath. Mortlock is a different matter, as it's been made abundantly clear that Thalamra would disown him had she not agreed to the dying wish of her third husband to look after Mortlock despite his countless imperfections.

The last member of the Vanthampur family is Slobberchops, a mean-looking **tressym** (winged cat) with a bobtail and numerous battle scars. Characters who encounter Slobberchops can try to befriend it (see area V5).

![Map 1.5: Vanthampur Villa](img/adventure/BGDIA/017-47l11-map-1-5-dm.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/BGDIA/018-9v1gm-map-1-5.webp)
### About the Villa

Vanthampur Villa is a stately stone edifice with a detached stable house. Both buildings have sloped rooftops covered with red clay tiles. A 12-foot-high stone wall encloses the villa. Lanterns hanging along the wall's interior are lit at dusk and extinguished at dawn to illuminate the yard and villa at night. The wall features three wooden gates—the main entrance and a coach gate to the south, and a postern gate to the north.

The villa's wooden doors and lead-framed windows aren't locked, and the Vanthampurs employ guards to patrol the yard (see area V1). The guards live elsewhere and change shifts every six hours.

#### Servants

The Vanthampurs employ four full-time live-in servants (all neutral human **commoners**):

- Fendrick Gray, a decrepit seventy-year-old butler
- Sarvinder Peck, a salty fifty-two-year-old groundskeeper and stable master
- Gabourey D'Vaelan, a fussy thirty-five-year-old cook
- Ambra Fallwater, a plainspoken nineteen-year-old maid

Ambra is a recent hire to replace the previous maid, whom Duke Vanthampur threw down the stairs for breaking a vase.

### Villa Locations

The following area descriptions are keyed to *map 1.5*.

#### V1. Yard

Nine lawful evil human **guards** patrol the yard in three groups of three. When the characters first arrive, these groups are located at the points marked "V1" on *map 1.5*, and are circling the yard counterclockwise.

The guards attack anyone who trespasses onto the estate without the consent or prior notification of Duke Vanthampur or one of her sons. If the characters have Amrik or Mortlock with them, they can convince either of the duke's sons to talk them past the guards. Otherwise, the characters need to kill the guards or sneak past them. The guards are too well paid to accept bribes, and they have no respect for the Flaming Fist. To sneak past a group of guards, each character must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity (Stealth) check. This check is made with advantage at night or in fog.

#### V2. Stable House

This stone building contains stables for four **draft horses**, plus a fully equipped smithy with an anvil and a hearth. Sarvinder Peck (see "Servants" above) can be encountered here, making and fitting new shoes for the horses.

***Trapdoor.*** A 3-foot-square flagstone in the southwest corner of the stable doubles as a hidden trapdoor in the floor. Any character who searches the area finds the trapdoor with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. The stone covers a brick-walled shaft and a wooden ladder that descends 15 feet to area V27 of the dungeon. If the Vanthampurs need to flee the dungeon, they can use the trapdoor to reach their horses quickly.

![{@creature Thurstwell Vanthampur|BGDIA}](img/adventure/BGDIA/019-637000771038732405.webp)

#### V3. Foyer

If the characters knock on the front doors, the butler, Fendrick Gray (see "Servants"), makes his way here from area V10 to greet them. He ushers them in if they are expected, but turns them away otherwise.

Describe this area to the players as follows:

>>Apart from the main entrance, this room has two exits. A plaster shelf lined with ornate vases circles the room at a height of nine feet. Spread across the flagstone floor is a ten-foot-wide, fifteen-foot-long rug of exquisite design, depicting a royal coronation. Two tapestries hanging on the walls depict a dragon flying over a ship and pilgrims on camels, respectively.
>>

Four invisible **imps** lurk among the vases on the high shelf, one in each corner. The imps swoop down to attack anyone they perceive as intruders, including characters who have Mortlock or Amrik as a prisoner.

***Treasure.*** The vases, rug, and tapestries are valuable art objects, though they don't go well together. Each of the sixteen vases weighs 2 pounds and is worth 25 gp. The rug weighs 50 pounds and is worth 250 gp. Each of the two tapestries weighs 5 pounds and is worth 75 gp.

#### V4. Servants' Quarters

This undecorated room contains four single beds and a dining table for the manor's servants. The servants keep spare uniforms and other personal belongings in drawers under their beds. Nothing of value is kept here.

#### V5. Kitchen

Pleasant aromas fill this area throughout the day as cook Gabourey D'Vaelan (see "Servants") prepares meals for the Vanthampurs and their staff. Gabourey doesn't like other people in the kitchen while she works.

Pots, pans, and cooking utensils dangle above three wooden preparation tables in the middle of the room, and shelves are lined with bowls, platters, herbs, spices, and dried goods. A dumbwaiter with a manually operated rope-and-pulley system allows meals to be delivered to Duke Vanthampur's bedroom (area V17). A tiny bell near the dumbwaiter rings whenever the duke wants food sent up to her.

Slobberchops the **tressym** prowls the kitchen, killing rats and eating whatever Gabourey drops on the floor. Slobberchops has no loyalty to the Vanthampur family, and detests Thurstwell and his imp spies. The **tressym** befriends any character who feeds it, following that character around the house and using its Detect Invisibility trait to warn of invisible imps nearby.

#### V6. Pantry

Food and drink is stored on shelves in this musty room.

#### V7. Stairs Down

This room contains a barrel of fresh water and a brick-walled staircase that descends 15 feet to area V20.

#### V8. Parlor

While entertaining visitors in this room, the duke likes to sit in an austere, high-backed chair facing a pair of padded couches and a coffee table. A hidden compartment in the left armrest of the duke's chair contains a silvered dagger. A character who examines the chair can locate the hidden compartment with a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check.

Thin drapes cover the windows to diffuse the natural light, and the walls are lined with framed paintings of the duke, her three dead husbands, her three sons, and the family's winged cat, Slobberchops.

***Treasure.*** A tapestry hanging on the north wall depicts burning angels falling from the sky into a pit of fire. The tapestry weighs 5 pounds and is worth 150 gp.

#### V9. Dining Room

Thalamra Vanthampur and her sons gather here once a tenday for an always-tense family dinner. Read the following when the characters can see this area:

>>An iron-wrought chandelier hangs above a black oak dining table surrounded by eight high-backed chairs carved to look like devils. A fireplace dominates one wall, flanked by red-curtained windows. A handsome, glass-doored wine cabinet stands against one wall.
>>

Perched on the chandelier are three invisible **imps** that behave like the imps in area V3. A rope-and-pulley mechanism allows the chandelier to be lowered and raised. The rope is tied around a hook mounted on the east wall near the wine cabinet.

***Treasure.*** The cabinet contains a set of eight red crystal goblets (25 gp each) and sixteen bottles of wine. Fifteen of the bottles contain fine wine (10 gp each). The last bottle is laced with *Midnight Tears*, a tasteless poison (see "*Poisons*" in chapter 8 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*). This tainted bottle is set aside for guests whom the duke intends to eliminate.

#### V10. Gallery

Black curtains are drawn over the windows to the south, keeping this hall dark and cool. Unless otherwise occupied, Fendrick Gray, the venerable butler, paces the hall with a lantern while the maid, Ambra Fallwater, dusts (see "Servants"). A wooden staircase at the north end of the hall climbs 15 feet to area V11.

This gallery contains an eclectic collection of tapestries, paintings, and alabaster busts on pedestals meant to impress guests. The duke bought the pieces thinking them to be valuable art objects, but all are knockoffs acquired from dubious sources. The haphazardly assembled collection is a testament to bad taste.

***Wax Statue.*** A 6-foot-tall wax statue in one corner depicts **Duke Thalamra Vanthampur** cradling the family pet, Slobberchops, in her arms. The **tressym** has a wax rat in its mouth. Visitors who enter the gallery from the foyer (area V3) are often startled by the statue because of its location just inside the door and its lifelike appearance.

#### V11. Upstairs Hall

Lanterns hang from the rafters of this drafty hall. The staircase to the north descends 15 feet to area V10.

Five lawful evil human **guards** stand watch here—one by each door. They attack anyone not accompanied by a Vanthampur family member. If they hear trouble elsewhere, the guards can't be surprised, but they stay put unless ordered to move by a member of the family. Combat here alerts **Thurstwell Vanthampur** in area V13.

#### V12. Balcony

A crenelated stone battlement encloses this balcony overlooking the front yard. It's a 15-foot drop from the balcony to the ground.

#### V13. Thurstwell's Bedroom

Drab curtains cover the windows of this plain room, which contains a bed, a padlocked iron chest, a claw-footed iron bathtub, and a fireplace. Standing in the middle of the room is **Thurstwell Vanthampur**, a frail and hateful forty-two-year-old man clutching an *infernal puzzle box* (see "Treasure" below). If alerted to intruders, Thurstwell has locked the puzzle box in the iron chest and tucked the key into his robe pocket.

Thurstwell commands several imp spies who enter and leave his room through the chimney, but only one such creature is present when the characters arrive. This **imp** is invisible, lurks in the fireplace, and attacks anyone who threatens Thurstwell.

Thurstwell greets intruders in the most uncivil fashion—by casting *sacred flame* at the nearest one. On the same turn, he casts *sanctuary* on himself as a bonus action and uses his movement to cower behind the bed while the imp defends him. If taken prisoner, he whines about the failure of his guards to protect him and bides his time, hoping his captors get in over their heads and afford him a chance to escape. If interrogated, he offers the following information in exchange for his release:

- His mother, the duke, is in the dungeon below the villa with **Thavius Kreeg**. She and the former high overseer of Elturel are plotting to seize control of Baldur's Gate.
- He and his brothers recently stole the *Shield of the Hidden Lord* from a crypt under the city. A powerful devil named Gargauth is trapped in the shield, and has vowed to help the Vanthampurs conquer Baldur's Gate if released. **Thavius Kreeg** is confident that he can devise a way to release Gargauth from the shield.
- Thavius arrived in the city a few days ago with the puzzle box. The duke insisted that Thavius let the family safeguard the item while he studies the shield.

***Treasure.*** The *infernal puzzle box* is a new magic item described in *Appendix C*. Each puzzle box is unique in its design. This particular box belongs to **Thavius Kreeg** and was entrusted to Duke Vanthampur for safekeeping. Curious to know what's inside the box, the duke gave it to Thurstwell—supposedly her smartest son—to see if he could open it, but he's had no luck so far. Thurstwell can be threatened into relinquishing the box, or it can easily be taken from him. However, opening the box is beyond the ability of any of the characters. Falaster Fisk, a spy imprisoned in the dungeon (area V29), can advise the characters that taking the box to Candlekeep is their best bet for learning what it contains. The box holds a copy of the contract Thavius forged with Zariel to doom the city of Elturel.

The padlock on the chest can be picked by a character with *thieves' tools* who succeeds on a DC 15 Dexterity check. The chest weighs 50 pounds and contains a jumble of wrinkled garments, red wax candles, quills, blank sheets of parchment, and jars of ink. It also holds an unlocked wooden coffer containing 73 gp, 120 sp, and a *potion of healing*, as well as a black-covered tome titled *Apocalypto*—a poetic prophecy by an unknown author envisioning the end of the multiverse (worth 50 gp).

#### V14. Mortlock's Bedroom

This dark room contains a bed, a wooden chest with clawed feet, and a night table. The chest weighs 25 pounds and contains a few drab garments made for a man of Mortlock's size, a few worthless personal effects, and a stuffed troll doll from Mortlock's childhood.

#### V15. Amrik's Bedroom

This tastefully appointed room contains a bed, a side table, a claw-footed iron bathtub, a fireplace, and an iron-banded wooden chest. A three-foot-wide, six-foot-tall mirror is mounted to the east wall opposite the fireplace. The mirror's varnished wooden frame is carved with images of rats, ravens, and spiders.

***Treasure.*** Amrik's chest contains neatly folded and tailored apparel to fit a slender noble, and a jewelry box carved from bone (10 gp). This tiny box contains a gold signet ring (5 gp) bearing the Vanthampur motto, "Stone hearts never bleed."

#### V16. Duke's Powder Room

This room contains a vanity topped with a framed oval mirror, bottles of perfume, brushes, cosmetics, needles, and spools of thread. Other furnishings in the room include a folding wooden partition adorned with a bird of prey rendered in gold leaf, a tall black wardrobe filled with corsets and fine clothes, and a decorative gold rug laid out in front of three unlocked wooden chests. One chest is full of shoes, another contains three old bridal gowns, and the third contains seasonal hats.

***Treasure.*** The vanity holds six bottles of fine perfume (20 gp each), a silver hairbrush inlaid with lapis lazuli (100 gp), and a wooden jewelry box with electrum filigree (75 gp) holding a pearl necklace (250 gp), a platinum cameo shaped like a winged cat (50 gp), and two *potions of healing* in thin crystal vials.

#### V17. Master Bedroom

Duke Vanthampur retires to this chamber when she needs to rest or shake off a headache. She also takes most of her meals here. Food is delivered via a dumbwaiter in the southwest corner (see area V5 for details), which has a cord that rings a bell in the kitchen. Other features of the room include a canopied bed with a gossamer shroud for keeping insects at bay, a freestanding wooden privacy screen, a cast-iron bathtub with clawed feet, a fireplace, and a padlocked iron chest. The padlock is cast in the shape of a horned devil's scowling visage. Thalamra Vanthampur carries the key to the padlock (see area V28), which can be picked by a character with *thieves' tools* who succeeds on a DC 17 Dexterity check.

***Treasure.*** The chest weighs 65 pounds and is trapped (see "Trap" below). It contains three thin, black-covered ledgers with entries written in Infernal (records of Duke Vanthampur's legitimate business dealings), a set of *calligrapher's supplies* (15 gp), a *poisoner's kit* (50 gp), a coin pouch made from a sheep's bladder (containing 22 pp, 85 gp, and 113 sp), and *pipes of the sewers*.

***Trap.*** The chest has a false bottom underlaid with metal springs. The combined weight of the items in the chest holds the false bottom down, but if three or more items are removed, the false bottom rises and pulls the cork out of a thin glass vial hidden underneath it. The uncorked vial releases a cloud of poisonous gas that fills a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on the chest. The cloud is stationary and lasts for 1 minute, or until it's dispersed by a strong wind. Any creature that starts its turn in the cloud must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 11 (2d10) poison damage.

#### V18. Duke's Study

An oak writing desk angled to face the middle of the room has a matching chair behind it and two black candlesticks atop it. Other furnishings include three bookcases and a freestanding suit of black plate armor topped with a bucket helm and equipped with a longsword and a shield. A wrought-iron spiral staircase leads up to area V19.

The suit of armor is a **helmed horror** that was fashioned on Avernus. The construct understands Infernal but can't speak, and it is immune to the following spells: *fire bolt*, *sacred flame*, and *shocking grasp*. The only creatures permitted in this area are Duke Vanthampur and her sons. If any other creature enters the room unescorted, a fiery orange light fills the helmed horror's hollow interior as it attacks. The helmed horror pursues intruders beyond the room, returning here only after the trespassers leave the villa or are hacked to pieces.

***Bookcases.*** Duke Vanthampur abhors reading but keeps a modest library of fine literature for the sake of appearances. Her study contains two hundred books. A character who spends 1 hour sifting through the collection can find twenty rare first editions (25 gp each). The remaining books are worth 5 gp each to interested buyers, except for a worthless book titled *Last Charge of the Hellriders*. A cavity cut into its pages holds a small iron ring with two keys hanging from it. These keys unlock the cages in area V19.

#### V19. Tower Peak

If the characters climb the wrought-iron spiral staircase from area V18, describe this room as follows:

>>The spiral staircase climbs fifteen feet to a square room with crisscrossing rafters ten feet overhead and a peaked roof above that. An empty bookcase dominates the west wall, and two filthy padlocked cages stand on the floor. Each cage holds a human prisoner and a chamberpot.
>>

The keys to open the cages' padlocks can be found in area V18. A character with *thieves' tools* can also pick a lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. The locks can't be picked from inside the cages.

Perched atop the cages are two invisible **imps**. When no one else is around, the imps torment the prisoners with idle threats and taunts, and the prisoners know not to speak or cry out lest the imps sting them. The imps avoid combat with well-armed intruders. If anyone tries to free a prisoner, the invisible imp closest to that prisoner slips through the bars of the cage and stings the prisoner to death, turning visible as it does so. On its next turn, the imp turns invisible and takes refuge above the rafters.

***Prisoners.*** The prisoner in the northern cage is Shaleen Zoraz (neutral female human **commoner**), a sewer maintenance supervisor who was backing an effort to extend the Lower City's sewer system into the underground space occupied by the Dungeon of the Dead Three. Duke Vanthampur plans to hold Shaleen for a few days before letting her go. The imps have so terrorized Shaleen that, if freed, she intends to abandon her expansion plans and never say an unkind word about the Vanthampurs for the rest of her life.

The prisoner in the southern cage is Kaejil Orûnmar (neutral evil male human **commoner**), a tax collector who has been giving the Vanthampurs a hard time. Once Duke Vanthampur is satisfied that no one important will miss him, she plans to kill Kaejil and feed his remains to the rats in the city sewers. If freed, Kaejil plans to leave Baldur's Gate and never return.

## Under the Villa

![Map 1.6: Under the Villa](img/adventure/BGDIA/020-zb6kf-map-1-6-dm.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/BGDIA/021-8iocy-map-1-6-player.webp)As the minister responsible for the city's sewer system, Thalamra Vanthampur cordoned off the sewers beneath her villa, creating a private dungeon complex where she could conduct religious ceremonies and harbor guests who share her devotion to the archdevil Zariel.

### Dungeon Features

The dungeon is remarkably clean and kept in excellent condition. Its common features are summarized here.

**Lit Tunnels**. Tunnels are 9 feet high and have curved ceilings. Oil lanterns fitted with thick panes of green-tinted glass hang at regular intervals on 1-foot-long iron chains. Each lantern sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius.

**Iron Doors**. Doors are made of riveted iron plates, with iron handles and well-oiled hinges. Some doors have locks or barred windows set into them, as noted in the text. A character can use *thieves' tools* to pick a door's lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check, or force open a locked door with a successful DC 24 Strength (Athletics) check.

**Surfaces and Secret Doors**. The dungeon has brick walls and stone-tiled floors. Rooms have 10-foot-high plaster ceilings. Secret doors blend in with the surrounding walls, but a character with darkvision or sufficient light can find a secret door with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check.

**Smell of Incense**. Pairs of black-robed human **cultists** march through the corridors with censers, constantly perfuming the sewers with incense to counteract what would otherwise be a mildly nauseating stench.

![{@creature Duke Thalamra Vanthampur|BGDIA}](img/adventure/BGDIA/022-637000757702239303.webp)

### Dungeon Locations

Before the characters descend into the dungeon, allow them to advance to 4th level.

The following area descriptions are keyed to *map 1.6*.

#### V20. Cellar

The characters might enter this cellar by descending the stairs from area V7, or they might enter through the eastern door. Read the following boxed text to establish what they see from either direction:

>>Four stone pillars brace the ten-foot-high vaulted ceiling of this dry cellar, the walls of which are lined by a dozen barrels on wooden braces. Half the barrels have brass spigots tapped into them. The room also contains two stacks of wooden crates—one in the middle of the room and another by the south wall.
>>

The topmost crate in the middle of the room contains three **spined devils** that spy on this area through knotholes in the crate's sides. These devils burst forth and attack intruders on sight. The other crates in the middle of the cellar contain dried meat, loaves of bread, wheels of cheese, and other assorted foodstuffs—enough to sustain the Vanthampurs and the cultists in the dungeon for a month. The crates by the south wall contain candles, oil flasks, incense, and rat traps.

Six of the barrels contain drinking water, and six contain ale.

#### V21. Wine Cellar

More than two hundred corked bottles of wine are displayed in seven-foot-tall wooden racks that span the west and south walls. Empty wooden crates are stacked in the middle of the room.

***Treasure.*** Seventeen of the bottles contain fine wine (10 gp per bottle). The remaining wines on display are common vintages (1 sp per bottle).

#### V22. Sewer Tunnels

The dungeon's denizens make frequent use of these lit tunnels. The thick smell of incense hangs in the air (see "Dungeon Features" above).

Smooth stone trenches cut into the floors channel water and waste toward area V30. These trenches are 4 feet wide and 3 feet deep, with arching stone bridges spanning them at irregular intervals. The ledge on either side of a trench is 3 feet wide.

***Wandering Monsters.*** Ordinary rats occasionally enter the dungeon through the open pipes in the walls. The cultists lay traps to catch and kill these rats while they perfume the dungeon with incense. As the characters make their way through the tunnels, they might encounter these cultists.

A typical encounter consists of two lawful evil human **cultists** dressed in black robes, each carrying a censer and wearing a thin, golden mask shaped like a devil's face (and worth 25 gp to an interested buyer). The censers contain burning incense. A devil mask covers its wearer's whole face except for the eyes, nostrils, and mouth. No two masks look exactly alike.

If this encounter occurs in a tunnel that has a sewer trench running down the middle of it, the two cultists are walking on opposite sides of the trench, moving in the same direction while swinging their censers gently. You can make the encounter harder by replacing the cultists with **cult fanatics**, or adding one or more invisible **imps** as escorts.

If any wandering cultists are defeated, reduce the number of cultists encountered in area V33 accordingly. If the characters make no effort to hide the bodies of the cultists they defeat, someone stumbles upon them eventually and warns the **barbed devil** in area V26. Assuming it hasn't been defeated already, the devil scours the dungeon for trespassers once notified of their presence.

#### V23. Cold Storage

The Vanthampurs store animal carcasses and other fresh meat in this room. Hanging in the middle of the room from the 10-foot-high ceiling are six 3-foot-long chains, each ending in a hook. Flayed boar carcasses hang from four of the hooks, while the remaining two hooks are bare.

#### V24. Dining Room

The cultists dine here, though none are present when the characters first arrive. Two wooden trestle tables with benches stand in the middle of the room, which is brightly lit by six tall wrought-iron candlesticks spaced along the walls. Each candlestick stands six feet high and has nine lit candles at the top of it.

#### V25. Kitchen

The cultists prepare their meals here, though no cultists are present when the characters first arrive. The kitchen is uncomfortably warm and contains a pair of brightly burning cast-iron stoves with piles of wood next to them. Other furnishings include a wooden trestle table where food is prepared, as well as shelves lined with plates, mugs, pots, utensils, and jars of ingredients and spices.

#### V26. Temple of Zariel

The iron double door leading to this room has Infernal runes carved into its arched door frame. A character who understands Infernal can translate these runes as follows: "That which falls can rise again."

> ##### Disguised Characters
>
>Characters can disguise themselves using masks and robes taken from defeated cultists. While disguised in this fashion, characters have advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks made to fool devils and cult members in the dungeon under Vanthampur Villa.
>

A character who listens at the double door or one of the secret doors leading to this room hears a half dozen humanoid voices chanting in Infernal. Characters who listen to the chants and understand that language can discern praise heaped upon the archdevil Zariel for her tireless effort to win the Blood War.

When the characters enter the room, set the scene by reading aloud the following boxed text:

>>Two rows of tall wrought-iron candlesticks light this vaulted chamber, each one bearing nine flickering candles. A seven-foot-tall statue of an angel with white glowing eyes and a longsword stands atop a dais to the south. A six-foot-tall fiend bristling with spines stands west of the statue, glaring at four black-robed cultists who kneel and chant in the middle of the room, their faces hidden behind golden devil masks. Nine tapestries depicting the layers of the Nine Hells adorn the walls.
>>

The spined fiend is a **barbed devil** named Odious. Sent by Zariel to serve Duke Vanthampur, the devil answers only to those two. The chanting figures are four lawful evil human **cultists** wearing black robes and golden devil masks similar to those worn by the cultists in area V22. The devil and the cultists attack intruders on sight, but can be duped by characters wearing disguises (see the "Disguised Characters" sidebar).

***Statue.*** The statue represents Zariel in her angelic form. It's a Large object with AC 17, 33 hit points, and immunity to fire, poison, and psychic damage. Toppling the statue with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check causes it to shatter on the floor.

***Treasure.*** The statue's head and neck are hollow. Lodged in this cavity is a *+1 mace* that can be removed only if the statue is destroyed. The head of the mace sheds bright light in a 5-foot-radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet. The wielder of the mace can extinguish or ignite its light as an action. (This light is what causes the statue's eyes to glow.)

#### V27. Escape Tunnel

Hidden behind a secret door, this tunnel has a wooden ladder at its north end. The ladder climbs a 15-foot-high shaft to a trapdoor that opens into area V2.

#### V28. Secret Shrine

This room is hidden behind secret doors (see "Dungeon Features"). The scraping noise either door makes when opened is loud enough to alert the room's occupant. Read the following when the characters enter:

>>This room is lit by a pair of tall wrought-iron candlesticks in the northeast and southeast corners. Nine candles burn atop each one, casting flickering light across a claw-footed altar carved from a single block of obsidian, and which has a small angel-shaped flame erupting from its top. A gray-haired woman kneels before the altar.
>>

**Duke Thalamra Vanthampur** kneels before the altar. She wears fine clothing fit for a noble of her stature and carries no weapons. However, she possesses magical powers bestowed upon her by Zariel, her infernal patron. Any intrusion is greeted with hostility, and the duke is not squeamish about smashing foes with her bare hands if she finds herself in melee. Don't forget her Hellish Rebuke reaction, which she can use twice per day (but only once before her next turn).

If she is reduced to fewer than half her hit points, Thalamra tries to escape through the nearest secret door that isn't blocked. She either moves to area V36 or attempts to flee via area V27. Proud to a fault, she would rather die than surrender or be taken prisoner—and she happily watches any of her sons die before consenting to ransom demands. When death finally takes her, Thalamra's dying words to her killers are, "See you in hell."

Thalamra keeps two keys in a pocket of her dress. One key unlocks the chest in her bedroom (area V17); the other key unlocks the door to the vault (area V36).

***Obsidian Altar.*** The black altar weighs 800 pounds and has tiny Infernal runes carved in a ring around the nine-inch-tall, angel-shaped flame erupting from its top. This flame bears only a vague resemblance to Zariel. Defacing any of the altar's runes extinguishes the flame and causes the altar to crack in two.

#### V29. Prison

Read the following boxed text when the characters open the door to this room:

>>A broad-shouldered figure with purple skin and a beard of writhing snakelike tentacles stands in the middle of a room lined by iron doors, tightening its grip on a glaive as it glares at you through the darkness. Each door is set with a small barred window, and a ring of keys hangs from the creature's belt.
>>

The prison guard is a **bearded devil** named Thoss, which attacks anyone it perceives as an intruder or a threat. Characters disguised as cultists can try to dupe Thoss into allowing them to interrogate or release prisoners (see the "Disguised Characters"). The keys dangling from the devil's belt unlock the cell doors.

Two of the cells (your choice) contain prisoners. The other four cells are empty, though captured characters might end up here (see the "Imprisoned Characters" sidebar). If you need to introduce a new party member to replace one who died, that character can begin the adventure locked in one of the empty cells.

***Falaster Fisk.*** The first prisoner is a short, lean, erudite male human in his fifties named Falaster Fisk. Originally from Calimshan, Falaster is a neutral **spy** with no weapons. He speaks Common and Infernal, wears an ankle-length caftan, and has dark hair. His neatly trimmed goatee beard is dyed crimson.

Falaster works for **Sylvira Savikas**, a tiefling expert on the Nine Hells currently based in Candlekeep. When **Thavius Kreeg** arrived in Baldur's Gate a few days ago, it didn't take Falaster long to hear rumors that the Vanthampurs were sheltering him. Falaster tried to find out why and was caught. He can provide his rescuers with the following useful information:

- "**Sylvira Savikas** is a sage who operates out of Candlekeep. A good friend of mine! She's been monitoring devil activity in Baldur's Gate and Elturel for months."
- "Sylvira is convinced that **Thavius Kreeg** struck a bargain with an archdevil, and that a copy of the contract he signed is hidden inside a magic puzzle box. She asked me to help her obtain proof of Kreeg's crimes."
- "Sylvira is no friend of **Thavius Kreeg**'s. She thinks she can open his puzzle box, and is willing to pay for it—in gold or magic items."

If released, Falaster helps the characters as best he can while staying out of harm's way. Expecting that he might be caught, he obtained and memorized a floor plan of the dungeon under Vanthampur Villa. He can thus lead his rescuers to secret rooms (areas V28 and V34) and the Vanthampurs' vault (area V36).

***Satiir Thione-Hhune.*** The second prisoner is a fit, aristocratic human woman in her seventies named Lady Satiir Thione-Hhune. Born into the rich and politically powerful Hhune patriar family, Satiir is a neutral evil **noble** with no weapons or armor (AC 11). She was kidnapped by the Vanthampurs to be used as leverage in the event that the Hhunes find out who stole the *Shield of the Hidden Lord* from their family's crypt.

Unknown to the Vanthampurs, Satiir is a member of a secret evil order whose members call themselves the Knights of the Shield, and who are the self-appointed guardians of the *Shield of the Hidden Lord*. Satiir doesn't speak of the shield. Instead, she tells her rescuers that the Vanthampurs were planning to use her to keep the Hhunes from opposing Duke Vanthampur's bid to become the new grand duke. If Satiir is allowed to escape, she informs her family and associates that the Vanthampurs stole the shield, destroying Duke Vanthampur's political future in Baldur's Gate. The characters might encounter more of Satiir's friends on the way to Candlekeep (see "Knights of the Shield").

#### V30. Barrier of Iron Bars

This sewer tunnel slopes down gradually toward the south, channeling water and sewage into the city's sewer system. The tunnel is blocked by a 10-foot-square barrier composed of vertical iron bars with 6-inch gaps between them—enough room for a rat to saunter through, but too narrow for normal-sized characters to squeeze through. The bars are embedded deep into the stone of the floor and ceiling.

A character can bend the bars with a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check, creating a gap wide enough for a Medium or smaller humanoid to squeeze through.

> ##### Imprisoned Characters
>
>If the characters are defeated in Vanthampur Villa or the dungeon below, you can have the bad guys stabilize dying party members, strip them of their gear (which is stored in area V28), and lock them in the prison (area V29). This alternative to a "total party kill" scenario affords **Duke Thalamra Vanthampur** and her cultists the opportunity to interrogate the characters and find out what they know. It also sets up the possibility of a prison break.
>

#### V31. Vestry

Four wooden wardrobes stand against the walls in this area. The cultists store their robes and masks in these wardrobes before leaving the dungeon and returning to the city above. The wardrobes along the west wall stand empty. Characters who search the wardrobe on the south wall find four sets of black robes and four gold devil masks, as worn by the cultists encountered elsewhere in the dungeon.

#### V32. Connecting Tunnel

The dim light from two of the cultists' green-glass lanterns doesn't reach the ends of this corridor, creating pools of darkness there. Two lawful evil human **cult fanatics** guard the tunnel, one at each end. Characters with darkvision or their own light sources spot the fanatics. Otherwise, the fanatics surprise the characters. Each fanatic wears a black robe and a thin gold devil mask similar to those worn by cultists in other areas.

Sounds of combat here alert the cultists in area V33, who arm themselves but stay where they are.

#### V33. Cultists' Quarters

This room is lit by two tall wrought-iron candlesticks each topped with nine flickering candles. Around the room's perimeter are ten wooden bunk beds, next to which are unlocked footlockers containing ordinary clothes belonging to the cultists.

Ten **cultists** gather here, minus any cultists defeated in area V22. These cult members are lawful evil humans wearing black robes and thin gold devil masks. Some have dozed off, while others are sitting on their beds, sharing rumors regarding **Thavius Kreeg**'s hand in the fall of Elturel and Duke Vanthampur's plans for Baldur's Gate. These cultists show intruders no quarter.

Sounds of combat here alert the cult fanatics in area V32, who investigate immediately.

#### V34. Ritual Chamber

This room is hidden behind secret doors (see "Dungeon Features"), and its features are as follows:

>>This ten-foot-high vaulted chamber has a plaster ceiling painted with images of terrifying winged devils looking down on a symbol embedded in the room's floor: a circular disk of black stone inscribed with a nine-pointed gold star. Four wrought-iron candlesticks bristling with unlit, half-melted red candles surround the circle.
>>

The cultists use this chamber to perform diabolical rituals that duplicate the effect of a *divination* spell, except that the spell's contact is a devil that manifests as a pillar of smoke above the symbol on the floor. The images on the ceiling are pit fiends, recognizable by any character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Religion) check.

#### V35. Thavius Kreeg's Quarters

Describe this room to the players as follows:

>>Wrought-iron candlesticks topped with flickering candles light this room, which is heated by a cast-iron stove with clawed feet. Across from the crackling stove is a modest desk with a matching chair. Other furnishings include a small table and chair for dining, a bed, an iron chest resting at the foot of the bed, and two tapestries: one showing spirits rising as lemure devils from the River Styx, and another depicting a dead man dangling like a marionette from hooked chains.
>>

***Treasure.*** Thavius keeps a holy symbol of Torm (a silver pendant shaped like a right-handed gauntlet on the end of a silver chain) in the chest. The holy symbol is worth 25 gp. The chest contains nothing else.

#### V36. Vanthampur Vault

The door to this room is locked (see "Dungeon Features"), and Duke Vanthampur has the only key. The door can be unlocked from the inside without the key. When the characters open the door to the vault, read or paraphrase the following boxed text to set the scene:

>>This room contains four wooden tables with two small wooden coffers atop each one. Hanging on the wall opposite the door is a beautiful golden shield. Standing in front of the shield is an old man in plain garments, carrying a lit candlestick. As he turns to face the door, you see that his shadow on the far wall doesn't match his form, but appears to be the shadow of a pudgy, horned fiend with small wings.
>>

The man is **Thavius Kreeg**, the former high overseer of Elturel. Formerly a priest of Torm (god of courage and self-sacrifice), he lost his spellcasting ability when he abandoned his faith and now only pretends to worship that deity. The shield hanging on the wall behind him is the *Shield of the Hidden Lord*, which is depicted and described in *Appendix C*. Thavius has been speaking to Gargauth, the fiend imprisoned in the shield, and has concluded that the shield is responsible for much of the rampant avarice and malice in Baldur's Gate. Given time, Thavius thinks he can use the shield to drag Baldur's Gate down into Avernus.

Thavius craves power and the appreciation of his hellish masters. However, he abhors violence and avoids combat whenever possible. He sheds crocodile tears for Elturel, claiming that he was visiting a parish a few miles outside the city when it disappeared, and expressing horror in response to the city's fall. Neither story holds up under scrutiny.

Thavius also lies about his relationship with Duke Vanthampur. He claims the duke's guards captured him shortly after his arrival in Baldur's Gate, and that the duke needs his help to ascertain the magical properties of the celestial shield, which her family "acquired" from a crypt under the city. Despite being a practiced liar, Thavius has no lie to explain his diabolical shadow.

If she's with the party, Reya Mantlemorn is awestruck in the presence of the high overseer, and won't allow the characters to harm Thavius as long as she believes he's innocent of wrongdoing. His altered shadow is not damning enough evidence. Convincing Reya that Thavius is corrupt can be accomplished by forcing a confession out of him with a successful DC 15 Charisma (Intimidation) check, or by proving that he has lost his spellcasting abilities. If the characters kill Thavius, they can encounter him again in chapter 3, after his soul is turned into a devil.

***Shield of the Hidden Lord.*** The devil Gargauth is bound into the *Shield of the Hidden Lord* and wants to escape from it. The fiend believes it can break out once the shield is taken to the Nine Hells—and it needs the characters' help to get there.

Gargauth senses the presence of the characters when they enter the room and telepathically contacts one of them at random. Referring to itself as the Hidden Lord, the devil claims to be a celestial being and vows to help the characters rescue Elturel, provided they take the shield with them into the Nine Hells. The Hidden Lord also warns that a secret society is after the shield, and that it's only a matter of time before its evil members find it. Gargauth claims that this secret society doesn't want the shield's powers to be used for good, which is the truth.

Duke Vanthampur and **Thavius Kreeg** have promised to help Gargauth break out of the shield, provided the fiend spreads corruption throughout the city by uniting the patriars behind the duke—and, by extension, behind the archdevil Zariel. Only then can Baldur's Gate suffer the same fate as Elturel. However, Gargauth is happy to take advantage of a more expedient means of returning to the Nine Hells if the characters offer it one. The Hidden Lord has no loyalty to anyone but itself.

***Treasure.*** The eight coffers are unlocked and contain money belonging to the Vanthampur family, as well as treasure stolen from Tiamat's hoard on Avernus. Duke Vanthampur plans to use this combined treasure to bribe the city's patriars and government officials into supporting her bid to become the new grand duke.

Coffer 1 contains 30 electrum ingots (10 gp each) belonging to the Vanthampur family.

Coffers 2, 3, and 4 each contain 100 gp belonging to the Vanthampur family.

Coffer 5 contains two pieces of a broken ceremonial dagger stolen from Tiamat's hoard: a curved ivory blade bearing Draconic runes that spell out "Fang," along with a bone hilt wrapped in leather strips and studded with gemstones. A *mending* cantrip can make the nonmagical dagger whole again, restoring its value (250 gp).

Coffers 6 and 7 each contain 100 pp belonging to the Vanthampur family.

Coffer 8 contains twenty azurite gemstones (10 gp each) stolen from Tiamat's hoard.

## Final Encounters in Baldur's Gate

If the characters fail to locate **Thavius Kreeg**'s *infernal puzzle box* (see area V13) or the *Shield of the Hidden Lord* (see area V36), an NPC such as Reya Mantlemorn or Falaster Fisk recommends a more thorough search of the Vanthampur estate. As a Hellrider, Reya might be able to sense the presence of the celestial shield and urge the characters to retrieve it, lest it fall into evil hands. Similarly, Falaster loathes to leave the puzzle box behind for someone else to snatch up.

If Slobberchops the **tressym** (see area V5) is with the party, it can lead characters to the puzzle box. Captured villains can also lead characters to the puzzle box or the shield, as needed. Once these items are found, Falaster strongly urges the characters to deliver them to **Sylvira Savikas** at Candlekeep.

If invited to join the characters on their journey to Candlekeep, Reya and Falaster readily accept. Falaster has a modest dwelling in Little Calimshan, a walled neighborhood in the Outer City, and suggests making a brief stop there so he can equip himself with weapons before continuing the journey to Candlekeep.

### Reporting to Captain Zodge

Once the characters wipe out the Vanthampur family and its devil-worshiping cult, they can return to Captain Zodge to deliver their report, surrender their Flaming Fist badges, and receive any payment owed to them.

Zodge is gratified to learn that the Vanthampurs are no longer his concern. If the characters report that one or more family members are still alive, Zodge promises to hunt them down and punish them for their crimes.

### Commander Portyr

As the characters conclude their business with Captain Zodge, the meeting is interrupted by the arrival of a higher-ranking member of the Flaming Fist. Read or paraphrase the following text to the players:

>>Your meeting with Captain Zodge is interrupted by the arrival of several Flaming Fist soldiers clad in plate armor. From behind this wall of swords and steel steps an armored woman with a white cloak and graying hair.
>>
>>"Are these the maniacs who've stirred up every nest of rats in this gods-forsaken city?"
>>
>>"Commander Portyr!" says Zodge. "I was told you wouldn't be in Baldur's Gate for at least another tenday."
>>
>>"That's what the city's government wanted you to think, captain," she replies. Turning to you, she says, "I trust you've been adequately compensated?"
>>

Until recently, **Liara Portyr** commanded a Flaming Fist outpost called Fort Beluarian on the distant tropical peninsula of Chult. Her uncle is Duke Dillard Portyr of Baldur's Gate, one of the city's two remaining government leaders (assuming Duke Vanthampur did not survive). Duke Portyr summoned his niece to take command of the Flaming Fist in Grand Duke **Ulder Ravengard**'s absence. Her trip home was expedited by magic.

Liara aims to assert herself as **Ulder Ravengard**'s natural successor but clings to the hope that he's still alive. If the characters think they have any chance to rescue Elturel—and Ravengard along with it—Liara strongly urges them to pursue that quest. Her experiences in Chult have taught her to respect adventurers and their ability to get things done.

If the characters didn't find Falaster Fisk in the dungeon under Vanthampur Villa, Liara Portyr can be the one who urges them to travel to Candlekeep and seek out **Sylvira Savikas**, a renowned expert on the Nine Hells. Sylvira can help them unlock the *infernal puzzle box* and the mysteries of the *Shield of the Hidden Lord*.

After making sure the characters receive their promised reward, Liara thanks them for doing their part to help Baldur's Gate. Although she must focus her efforts on various threats to the city's security, she makes it possible for the characters to leave Baldur's Gate when they're ready, going as far as to secure a riding horse or pony for each party member to expedite their journey to Candlekeep. She can also provide a mule-drawn cart laden with food, drink, and other supplies.

## Journey to Candlekeep

When the characters are ready to leave for Candlekeep, read the following boxed text to the players:

>>As the Basilisk Gate opens, Flaming Fist soldiers hold back the tide of Elturgardian refugees. You cut a path through these wretched souls, whose wails intensify as the Basilisk Gate closes behind you. The dirt road cuts through the slums of the Outer City, past the walled neighborhood of Little Calimshan, to the great span of Wyrm's Crossing.
>>

If Falaster Fisk is with the party, he leads them to his residence in Little Calimshan. In addition to grabbing weapons, he also brings along an old book of Calishite recipes to trade for admittance into the great library of Candlekeep (see "Entering Candlekeep").

### Wyrm's Crossing

The characters must cross this landmark to reach the Coast Way, which heads south to Candlekeep. Read the following to describe the scene:

>>Two great bridges meet at a tall, rocky island that rises from the middle of the Chionthar River. Buildings and merchant stalls line the sides of both bridges, making it impossible to see the river from the narrow, congested roadway that cuts between those structures.
>>
>>Wooden drawbridges connect the two bridges to a keep situated atop the island. The flags of Baldur's Gate and the Flaming Fist wave proudly above this fortress.
>>

Wyrm's Crossing is a cutpurse's paradise, and every traveler here runs the risk of being pickpocketed. As the characters make their way from one end of Wyrm's Crossing to the other, have each player roll a d20. (Don't roll for NPCs traveling with the party.) The character or characters with the lowest roll are targeted by a pickpocket (use the **bandit** stat block).

Use a character's passive Wisdom (Perception) score to determine whether a theft made against that character is successful. If the character's score is 11 or higher, the theft is detected and thwarted. Otherwise, the thief makes off with one item weighing 1 pound or less (such as a coin pouch or potion) and disappears into the crowd before the theft is noticed. If a character is robbed, ask the player what small items the character is carrying, then decide which of those items was stolen.

### Knights of the Shield

The following encounter occurs only if the characters have the *Shield of the Hidden Lord*. Otherwise, skip ahead to the "Tale of the Hellriders" section. Read the following to set the scene:

>>As Wyrm's Crossing and Baldur's Gate disappear from view, you find yourselves heading down the Coast Way, a dirt road that leads to such distant lands as Tethyr, Amn, and Calimshan. Candlekeep lies some one hundred and fifty miles south and west—a five-day journey.
>>
>>Coming up the road toward you is a human farmer riding on the front of a hay-filled wagon pulled by two draft horses. The farmer gives you a friendly wave as the wagon draws near.
>>

The farmer is Kaddrus, a lawful evil **cambion** using the *alter self* spell to conceal his true form. Hiding under the hay are the cambion's evil accomplices: three human **veterans** who speak Common and Infernal. Their names are Falar and Zaroud al'Ryshal, and Nulra Blacksaddle. When the cambion gives the order in Infernal, the veterans leap out of the hay and attack. Meanwhile, the cambion assumes his true form, flies up into the air, and targets creatures with his Fire Ray attack. The two **draft horses** are ordinary beasts but don't spook easily.

Kaddrus and the veterans are members of a secret society known as the Knights of the Shield (see area V29). Their goals are to kill the characters and take the *Shield of the Hidden Lord* back to the Hhune patriar family in Baldur's Gate. If the veterans are killed or incapacitated, Kaddrus flies back to Baldur's Gate to report to his superiors. If the cambion escapes, the characters might encounter him again in Candlekeep, in the guise of a monk. The next time he encounters the party, Kaddrus fights to the death to claim the shield.

### Tale of the Hellriders

If Reya Mantlemorn is with the characters, she shares the following tale over a campfire at some point during the characters' five-day journey to Candlekeep:

>>"It was over a century past that the great troubles began. Fiends roamed the lands to the north and west of Elturel. Fields were despoiled, livestock slaughtered, homes razed, and people dragged off to a terrible and unknowable fate. Terror gripped the hearts of all.
>>
>>"The city's cavalry rode across the land, striking down fiends wherever they found them and suffering fearful losses. But it was never enough. For every fiend they destroyed, it seemed as though two more appeared elsewhere. The ruler of Elturel, the High Rider, asked his people to pray to the gods for aid. To everyone's astonishment, a mighty angel entered the city the next day. Her name was Zariel, which means Companion of Light. The prayers of Elturel had been heard, and help had come.
>>
>>"Zariel located the gate through which the fiends were entering the natural world, on the Fields of the Dead west of the city. Zariel declared that she would lead the cavalry into Avernus, destroying the infernal host that was amassing there, and striking a great blow against the forces of darkness.
>>
>>"The High Rider sent out the riders of Elturel, now numbering many thousands, with Zariel at their head, riding a golden mastodon. With a great cry, Zariel and her army charged through the gate. The legions of Avernus trembled and buckled, but did not crumble. Zariel was defeated, and the remnants of her army returned to Elturel, overcome with grief at the loss of their glorious general but confident that the lords of the Nine Hells would think twice about threatening Elturel again.
>>
>>"There were great celebrations to honor the valiant knights of the cavalry, who became known as Hellriders from that day on." 
>>

## Candlekeep

Candlekeep is a fortress perched on a spur of rock overlooking the Sea of Swords. It is reached by a single road, the Way of the Lion, which branches west off the Coast Way.

Candlekeep is always open to visitors and boasts one of the finest libraries in Faerûn. The monks of Candlekeep also preserve the predictions of Alaundo the Seer, a singular sage whose prophecies have proved correct over long years. Upon the seer's death, Candlekeep became a haven for both the veneration of his prophecies and the accumulation of all knowledge. If there's a secret to be learned, the clues to finding it can probably be found in Candlekeep.

The encounters in Candlekeep focus on social interaction and exploration. The following events unfold here:

- The characters arrive at Candlekeep, where the price of admittance is a book—specifically one not already contained in the monks' library.
- The characters meet with **Sylvira Savikas**, a tiefling sage who knows the secret to unlocking **Thavius Kreeg**'s *infernal puzzle box*.
- Sylvira advises the characters to leave the *Shield of the Hidden Lord* in her custody, but Gargauth makes a good case for taking the shield with them.
- Sylvira makes arrangements to send the characters to Elturel, and gives them an unreliable map of Avernus. Reya Mantlemorn offers to go with the characters, while Falaster Fisk chooses to stay behind.

### The Way of the Lion

Read the following boxed text to describe the characters' final day of travel to Candlekeep:

>>Over the past four days, the weather on the Coast Way has gradually worsened. Dark clouds release heavy rain until the road runs thick with mud, yet you trudge on, passing by friendly merchant caravans heading north.
>>
>>On the morning of the fifth day, the rain subsides but the dark clouds remain. Ahead, you see a path branch from the wider road, heading to the sea. A raven perches solemnly on a leaning post bearing two signs that point like arms toward the west. One says "The Way of the Lion." The other says "Candlekeep."
>>

Characters who head west along the Way of the Lion arrive at Candlekeep by mid-afternoon. You can show the players the illustration of Candlekeep, and can describe the view to them by reading the following:

>>The afternoon sun shines through the clouds to illuminate the gray walls and pale spires of a timeworn fortress that stands majestically atop a rocky promontory overlooking the sea. The trail leads straight to it.
>>

### Entering Candlekeep

Although some visitors travel to Candlekeep by air, most arrive on foot or on horseback. When the characters arrive at the gatehouse, read the following boxed text to the players:

>>At the gatehouse, you are greeted by three monks in purple robes: a human, a shield dwarf, and a sun elf. Around their necks hang holy symbols of Deneir, god of writing, whose symbol is a lit candle above an open eye.
>>
>>"Welcome to Candlekeep," says the elf in Common. "A gift is required from those seeking admittance. You must donate a book or scroll that isn't already in the library's archives. Please present your gift for inspection."
>>

All three monks are neutral good **priests** of Deneir. (Apply racial traits to their statistics as needed.) The monks study any book or scroll that's handed to them, the holy symbols around their necks glowing faintly as they do.

The monks are happy to accept either *Apocalypto* (the black-covered tome found in Vanthampur Villa; see area V13), Falaster Fisk's book of Calishite recipes, or a spellbook for admittance to Candlekeep. One such gift is enough for the whole party to be able to enter the library. If a character wants to offer up some other book or scroll, you decide whether the monks accept it as a gift.

If the characters try to sneak or force their way into Candlekeep, the fortress's defenses are brought to bear as described in the "Candlekeep Defenses" sidebar.

Once allowed inside, the characters are free to go where they please and stay as long as they wish. The outermost buildings include private dormitories for the monks and public quarters for visitors, as well as amenities one would expect to find in a self-sufficient settlement (bathhouses, clothiers, granaries, gardens, and so forth). Candlekeep even has a pub called the Hearth.

#### The Hearth

In Candlekeep's pub, guests and monks can enjoy each other's company and a good meal. Read the following boxed text to describe the Hearth:

>>The pub has a low ceiling supported by massive wooden crossbeams and narrow, shuttered windows. A large fire pit in the middle of the room is surrounded by a half dozen tables and matching benches.
>>

Thirty people can dine here comfortably at any time. The Hearth is always open, and the fire is never permitted to go out. A dozen patrons typically occupy the pub during the day, with more during lunch and supper.

When the characters first show up, one patron stands out among the rest: a chaotic good **ogre** wearing a *headband of intellect*. He sits by himself in a corner, reading a book titled *The Sum of Theology* by Saint Vetheera, a servant of Oghma (god of knowledge).

A few years ago, the ogre was like others of his kind—brutish and cruel. He met a halfling adventurer wearing the shiny gold headband and killed the puny runt for it. When the ogre attuned to it, the headband grew in size, allowing him to don it. As a genius, the ogre felt compelled to learn the error of his ways and seek out a better life. He adopted the name Little One, to honor the poor halfling whose life he cut short.

Shunned by polite society, Little One came to Candlekeep hoping to learn as much as he can. He's a quiet but popular fixture in the fortress, and the monks are always saying hello to him and recommending new books for him to read.

### Sylvira Savikas

When the characters are ready, they can make their way toward the main keep, a towering edifice housing hundreds of monks and wizards, and thousands of books and scrolls. As they meander through the keep, helpful monks stop to offer them directions. If Falaster Fisk is with the party, he already knows the way to Sylvira's laboratory, located in one of Candlekeep's spires. When the characters arrive there, read the following:

>>The walls of this circular tower chamber are punctuated by arched windows that are currently shuttered. Bookcases filled with eldritch volumes stand between the windows, while tables are crowded with specimen jars, alchemical equipment, and other clutter. Engraved into the floor of the chamber is a large, nine-pointed star.
>>
>>A middle-aged tiefling dressed in wizardly robes stands by one of the windows, caught in a fugue of intense contemplation. Perched on the corner of a table nearby is a spindly little demon with warty green skin, buggy eyes, thin black horns, and a whip-like tail.
>>
>>"I can't tell you how pleased I am to see you," says the tiefling. "What have you brought me?"
>>

**Sylvira Savikas**, a lawful neutral tiefling **archmage**, is one of Candlekeep's foremost sages, and specializes in knowledge pertaining to the Outer Planes. In addition to her other skills, she has Investigation +13. She speaks Abyssal, Celestial, Common, Draconic, Infernal, and Primordial. Her **quasit** familiar, Jezebel, adds just the right amount of mischief and chaos to her life. In the unlikely event that Sylvira becomes embroiled in combat, remember that tieflings have resistance to fire damage and darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.

If the characters don't have **Thavius Kreeg**'s puzzle box with them, Sylvira is disappointed but tries not to show it. If they present the box to her, she snatches it out of their hands and studies it closely. She takes similar interest in the *Shield of the Hidden Lord* (which she calls "the Shield of Gargauth"), but avoids touching it.

> ##### Candlekeep Defenses
>
>Attacking Candlekeep would be foolhardy. Although most of the monks are simple scholars, a few are powerful spellcasters. If any trouble occurs, an **archmage** and 1d4 **mages** investigate immediately. If they can't bring the situation under control in short order, an additional 1d4 **archmages** arrive to lend assistance.
>

#### Thavius and the Puzzle Box

Sylvira has this to say about **Thavius Kreeg** and his *infernal puzzle box*:

>>"I've been suspicious of the High Overseer of Elturel for a long time. But no one wanted to hear my concerns, because **Thavius Kreeg** was widely regarded as a hero who saved his city from an undead scourge, giving rise to the holy nation of Elturgard.
>>
>>"Hailed as a savior, Thavius made all citizens of Elturel swear an oath called the Creed Resolute, which binds them to defend the nation of Elturgard. I met him years ago, and my instincts told me he was a charlatan. Afterward, I grew to suspect that he had cut a deal with one or more powerful devils, using the Creed Resolute to bind all Elturel to his dark deal.
>>
>>"I wish to prove my theory, and I believe the evidence is locked inside the puzzle box."
>>

Sylvira is an expert on magic puzzle boxes, having made and sold a few herself. If the characters give her the *infernal puzzle box*, she examines it, asks Jezebel to fetch her a flask of dark liquid, and pours a small amount into the mazelike troughs carved into the box's surface. She then tips the box so that the liquid flows in certain directions through the mazelike patterns—until the box's horn inlays pop loose and it breaks apart.

Inside the box is a stack of nine chain-linked plates, each three inches on a side, cast of dark iron, and stamped with Infernal runes. Anyone who understands Infernal can translate the runes as follows:

>>Be it known to all that I, **Thavius Kreeg**, High Overseer of Elturel, have sworn to my master, Zariel, lord of Avernus, to keep the agreements contained in this oath.
>>
>>I hereby submit to Zariel in all matters and for all time. I will place Her above all creatures, living and dead. I will obey Her all my days and beyond with fear and servility.
>>
>>I recognize the dispensation of the device called the Solar Insidiator, hereafter called the Companion. In my capacity as High Overseer of Elturel and its vassal territories, I acknowledge that all lands falling under the light of the Companion are forfeit to Zariel. All persons bound by oath to defend Elturel are also considered forfeit. I further recognize that this dispensation will last fifty years, after which the Companion will return whence it came, taking Elturel and its oath-bound defenders with it, if that is Zariel's wish.
>>
>>All this is my everlasting pledge.
>>

If Reya Mantlemorn is with the party, she is so stung by the revelation that she collapses onto the floor and weeps for Elturel. Bound to the city by the Creed Resolute, she feels the imperative to return to it. "If Zariel wants my soul," says Reya, "she's welcome to try to take it."

#### Gargauth and the Shield

Sylvira has this to say about the *Shield of the Hidden Lord* and the devil imprisoned within it:

>>"This shield is a symbol of good's triumph over evil. Gazing at such beauty, one can easily overlook the terrible force bound within it. Gargauth is, I believe, its name, though it calls itself the Hidden Lord. It was a pit fiend sent by Asmodeus to corrupt mortals on the Material Plane, and there it amassed such a following as to rival that of gods. In that way, Gargauth became a sort of demigod, and having worshipers increased its power exponentially. My, how the mighty have fallen!
>>
>>"This shield has the power to corrupt everything around it. The Hhune family of Baldur's Gate has kept it for years now. Doubtless they'll want it back, but this shield should not be taken to any place where thousands of mortals reside. It needs to be locked away in an extradimensional space, away from corruptible souls."
>>

If the characters consider leaving the shield with Sylvira, Gargauth telepathically contacts the character with the most influence in the party and suggests an alternative course of action:

>>"Take me to the Nine Hells, and I'll swear to serve you faithfully as both a guide and an advisor."
>>

Gargauth's offer is genuine, for the fiend desperately wants the shield taken to the Nine Hells. It believes (incorrectly) that it will be able to escape the shield there. Sylvira leaves it to the characters to decide what to do with the shield. A small part of her is relieved if the characters decide to take it with them, as she knows the evil Knights of the Shield will never stop looking for it.

#### Poster Map of Avernus

If the characters intend to save Elturel, Sylvira can provide them with a map of Avernus—the only such map known to exist in Candlekeep. Unfold the poster map of Avernus at this time and let the players study it. Sylvira then gives the characters a word of caution:

>>"This map might not be entirely reliable," warns Sylvira. "Its creator went mad making it."
>>

More information about how to use the poster map can be found in chapter 3.

## Getting to Avernus

Although Sylvira can prepare the *plane shift* spell, there's no point, as magical wards placed on Candlekeep prevent creatures from using such means to go to or from the library. Instead, she presents an alternative plan for sending the characters to the Nine Hells:

>>"A wizard named **Traxigor** lives in a tower twenty miles from here. I've loaned him a spellbook or two, so he owes me a favor. I can have you delivered safely to his tower, and he can use a *plane shift* spell to take you straight to Elturel. Even more importantly, **Traxigor** is looking after an old friend of mine—someone with a history of battling devils in the Nine Hells. I think you'll enjoy her company very much. Her name is **Lulu**."
>>

Characters need not leave for **Traxigor**'s tower at once. If they wish to remain in Candlekeep for a while, Sylvira is happy to accommodate them. However, Reya Mantlemorn becomes more impatient the longer they stay. Falaster Fisk parts company with the characters at this time, choosing to remain at Candlekeep for a few days before returning to Baldur's Gate.

Characters can use Candlekeep's library to learn more about the Nine Hells. *Chapter 2* of the *Dungeon Master's Guide* contains lore on all nine layers, which the characters can learn once they've spent a day or two researching the plane. Characters can also research devils to learn everything that's said about them in the "Devils" entry of the *Monster Manual*.

Once they're ready to leave for **Traxigor**'s tower, read or paraphrase the following boxed text to the players:

>>Sylvira ushers you to a crescent-shaped landing platform with a stunning view of the sea. Waiting for you atop this platform are several griffons with saddles, their handlers standing nearby to help you. "The griffons have instructions to fly you to **Traxigor**'s tower," says Sylvira. "Don't worry, it's safe!"
>>

The handlers standing ready can help the characters mount the **griffons**. Each griffon can carry one rider plus gear. Once all the characters are mounted, read:

>>The griffons take flight and head out to sea, flying just below the clouds. Candlekeep looks no less majestic from the air but grows smaller as the griffons soar westward. Large, rocky islands pass below you, and beyond them lies the open sea. After a long journey, you see a windowless, doorless stone tower—which somehow floats in the sky ahead. The griffons pass through jagged holes riddling the tower's conical peak to land on the top floor below, which has a spiral staircase leading down.
>>

### Traxigor's Tower

Once the griffons land, characters are free to dismount and descend the stairs into **Traxigor**'s tower. After delivering the party safely to the tower, the griffons take a short rest before flying back to Candlekeep.

Read or paraphrase the following boxed text to the players when the characters descend into the tower:

>>One level down, you see a cluttered chamber illuminated by various objects upon which *continual flame* spells have been cast. Scurrying around the room is an otter dressed in a tiny red cassock. The otter mumbles to itself in Common, mentioning something about a tuning fork. Suddenly, it takes notice of you and stands upright. "**Lulu**! Wake up! Our guests have arrived!"
>>
>>At the sound of her name, a small elephant with golden fur appears from under a pile of blankets near a table strewn with alchemical equipment. The elephant takes to the air on feathery wings and lets out a pleasing trumpet sound.
>>

**Traxigor** was polymorphed into an otter years ago, and decided he preferred the new form to his original one (that of a wizened old man). His otter form was made permanent by a *wish* spell. He uses the **archmage** stat block, but is a Tiny beast with a Strength of 3. His alignment is chaotic good, and he speaks Common, Draconic, Dwarvish, Gnomish, Halfling, and Troglodyte. He has the *plane shift* spell prepared instead of *teleport*, and is searching for the tuning fork he needs to cast the spell. What little he knows about the characters has been communicated to him by *sending* spells, sent by **Sylvira Savikas** in advance of their arrival.

Characters can help **Traxigor** search for his missing tuning fork, which is keyed to the Nine Hells. Whoever rolls the highest on a Wisdom (Perception) check finds the tuning fork. Whoever rolls the lowest finds a random trinket, determined by rolling on the *Trinkets table* in chapter 5 of the *Player's Handbook*. **Traxigor** doesn't care if the character keeps the trinket or not, and doesn't remember how or when he acquired it.

### Lulu the Hollyphant

**Lulu** is a **hollyphant** (see *Appendix C* for her stat block) who has lost most of her memories, as well as her Innate Spellcasting trait. (This has no effect on her challenge rating.) She regains her Innate Spellcasting trait gradually over the course of the adventure, as follows:

- In *chapter 2*, **Lulu** regains the at-will ability to cast *light* when she arrives in Elturel for the first time.
- In *chapter 4*, **Lulu** regains her 2/day spells (*bless*, *cure wounds*, and *protection from evil and good*) when she arrives at the Bleeding Citadel.
- In *chapter 5*, **Lulu** regains her 1/day spells (*banishment*, *heal*, *raise dead*, *shapechange*, and *teleport*) once she helps reunite Zariel with her sword.

#### Lulu's Background

While studying a portal to the Nine Hells located in the Fields of the Dead west of Elturel, Sylvira found **Lulu** and befriended her. **Lulu** stayed with Sylvira at Candlekeep for a while but didn't get along with the tiefling's quasit familiar, Jezebel. Sylvira decided **Lulu** would make a better companion for **Traxigor**, given his eccentricity and good nature. **Lulu** is integral to the characters' future success, though they shouldn't know that yet.

**Lulu** can speak Celestial but prefers to use telepathy, which allows her to talk to one creature at a time. If a character asks **Lulu** about her history battling devils in the Nine Hells, she shares the following information:

>>"I was with the angel Zariel when she assembled her army of Hellriders to attack Avernus. Through the gate we went, tearing through devils like a song through air. Victory was within our grasp until some of the Hellriders betrayed us. They retreated through the gate and sealed it behind them.
>>
>>"Before she was captured, Zariel told me to hide her sword so that it wouldn't fall into evil hands. Someone helped me hide the sword, but I don't remember who. We found a place to hide it, but I don't remember where. I escaped Avernus, but I don't remember how. Most of my memory is gone, and I don't remember why."
>>

**Lulu**'s memory was badly damaged by events she can't remember, but a summary of those events is presented here for your benefit.

**Lulu** was more than Zariel's traveling companion. She was the angel's friend and war mount, with the power to shapechange into a golden-furred mammoth with wings. Their friendship stretches back centuries.

When defeat on Avernus appeared inevitable, Zariel entrusted her sword to Yael, her most loyal general, and ordered **Lulu** to help Yael find a way to hide the weapon. **Lulu** and Yael blundered into a mob of demons led by the demon lord Yeenoghu, but narrowly escaped. Yeenoghu's pet—an enormous demon named **Crokek'toeck**—chased Yael and **Lulu** across Avernus. Before it could devour them, Yael plunged Zariel's holy blade into a stone as **Lulu** poured every ounce of her celestial being into it. A fortress sprang up around the sword, hedging out all evil. The effort so taxed **Lulu** that she became disoriented and flew away, leaving Yael behind.

**Lulu** wandered Avernus for months until she came upon a traveling market called the Wandering Emporium. A rakshasa named Mahadi tricked her into thinking he was her friend, only to splash her with a tiny bit of water from the River Styx, leaving her in a feeble mental state and stripping away her spellcasting powers. Mahadi then gave **Lulu** to a group of devils as a gift for the archdevil Zariel. Zariel could not abide **Lulu**'s presence—but nor could she bring herself to harm her former friend. Zariel had **Lulu** sent back to Faerûn with her mental faculties restored. Unfortunately, the damage to **Lulu**'s memory was not so easy to repair.

#### Lulu's Memories

|:---:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | "I used to be able to shapechange into a golden mammoth. In this form, I served as Zariel's war mount."                                                                                                       |
|  2  | "Zariel's most loyal Hellrider, Yael, took the sword and plunged it into a rock. I called on every ounce of goodness in my heart to raise a shield around it—a fortress against evil."                        |
|  3  | "The demon lord Yeenoghu wants to destroy Zariel's sword. He hates it as much as he hates her. We fought him once, but I don't remember where."                                                               |
|  4  | "I wandered Avernus for a while, then hid in a place called the Wandering Emporium. I made a friend there. His name was Mahadi. Maybe he can help us."                                                        |
|  5  | "The Zariel I knew is gone, replaced by a devil with a halo of fire and vengeance. 'This is who I am,' she told me. 'When demons die, they cry out my name in terror.' Those were Zariel's last words to me." |
|  6  | "It was Zariel who sent me back here. I don't know why. Maybe—just maybe—there's a tiny little spark of goodness deep down inside her still."                                                                 |

#### Restored Memories

Friendship is important to **Lulu** in ways both physical and spiritual. Her growing friendship with the characters causes the hollyphant to remember things long forgotten. For the remainder of the adventure, **Lulu** can regain lost memories whenever you wish. Ideally, these memories come back to her one at a time at moments when her friendship with the characters feels important. Any remaining memories return at once when **Lulu** regains all her spellcasting abilities.

When the time comes for **Lulu** to recall a lost memory, roll a d6 and consult the **Lulu**'s Memories table to see which memory comes back to her, or just pick one. If you roll for a memory that has come up before, roll again or choose a different memory.

#### Roleplaying Lulu

**Lulu** doesn't have a mean bone in her little body. She believes in the power of friendship and looks forward to kicking evil's butt with the characters by her side.

If **Lulu** becomes too much of a burden for you to run as an NPC, see if one of the players wants to run the hollyphant as a secondary character. Provide the consenting player with a copy of **Lulu**'s stat block, noting that **Lulu** has presently lost her Innate Spellcasting trait. As she regains memories and the use of certain spells, notify the player of these changes to her character.

### Plane Shift

The characters should advance to 5th level before leaving **Traxigor**'s tower. When they're ready to be sent to Avernus, read the following boxed text aloud:

>>As you stand together in a circle, **Traxigor** taps the tuning fork on the floor and casts his *plane shift* spell.
>>
