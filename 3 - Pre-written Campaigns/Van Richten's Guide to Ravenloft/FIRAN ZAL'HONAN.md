# FIRAN ZAL'HONAN

A mask of charm and congeniality conceals one of the most ingenious and utterly ruthless intellects to stalk through the Mists. A wandering scholar, Firan Zal'honan is quick to claim his descent from a noble pedigree. In another life, he claims, he could have ruled as a wizard-king. But his brilliance led him along a stranger path: seeking to escape the Mists into the "true realities" beyond. Firan keeps the basis for his strange theories secret, but his ambitions drive him to travel the domains; visit accursed sites; and investigate inscrutable prophecy cycles, temporal conjunctions, and an unknown figure he calls "the escapee."
For all his arrogance, Firan dreads the Mists and seeks assistance traversing them. His most noteworthy partner is the Vistani leader Madame Eva, who secretly allows him to barter strange secrets for her agents' guidance through the Mists.
Firan is an enigmatic and abrasive expert, but his knowledge of the domains and their secrets is without peer. His research causes him to regularly cross paths with other sinister scholars, such as the priests of Osybus, a group he's equally likely to aid or oppose as his investigations demand. Firan's eccentricities include loathing the domain of Darkon, an almost-personal hatred for Barovia's Count Strahd von Zarovich, and his earnest fear of the Mists-he claims that if he entered them unguided, he would never escape. However, those who prove useful to him can earn a valuable temporary ally.

## FIRAN ZAL'HONAN'S TRAITS

Ideal. "Secrets are power. No foe can hide their mysteries from me."
Bond. "None of this is real. I will endure this test. I will reap my reward. I will have my revenge."
Flaw. "My genius is immortal and has been tested like no other."

## ADVENTURES WITH FIRAN ZAL'HONAN

Firan Zal'honan is an arrogant, pragmatic, amoral genius. Furthering his schemes or adopting him as a patron can draw a party into conflict with the most prominent villains in the Domains of Dread. Use the statistics of a human archmage to represent Firan. He is accompanied by an imp named Skeever, who appears as a piebald raven. Consider the following plots when featuring Firan in an adventure:

- The characters happen upon Firan, who claims to be waiting for them. He offers insight into rare magic or their ongoing quests if they'll assist him in investigating an infamous ruin nearby.
- A thief stole Firan's prized amulet-a chain bearing a tiny gold dragon skull. Uncharacteristically agitated, he offers the characters any knowledge he possesses if they retrieve the amulet swiftly.

## JANDER Sunstar

Born on the world of Toril, the high elf Jander Sunstar was an adventurer tragically transformed into a vampire. After defeating his master, he wandered far, struggling against his vampiric urges and eventually falling in love with an adventurer named Anna, who claimed to be from another world. When Jander revealed his true nature, Anna's companions assisted her in fleeing him. In a rage, Jander slew all those he blamed for keeping him and Anna apart. In the aftermath of the slaughter, the Mists gathered around Jander, transporting him to Barovia. There, Jander met Strahd von Zarovich and lived in Castle Ravenloft for a time. When the elder vampire sought to make Jander his servant, Jander tried to slay the count, failed, and fled into the Mists.
In the centuries that followed, Jander wandered as a mysterious adventurer, secretly seeking a cure for vampirism. He's discovered multiple remedies, but none work for him. In recent decades, his attempt to save a fellow adventurer resulted in the birth of Savra Sunstar, a dhampir (see chapter 1) who Jander considers his daughter. Savra loathes him, though, and has devoted her life to hunting him and all vampires.
This estrangement pushed Jander to seek more radical methods of expunging his vampirism. Assisting in the experiments of a mysterious alchemist in Mordent, he became the first to test a prototype of the enigmatic Apparatus (see "Mordent" earlier in the chapter). But the machine malfunctioned; instead of purging his vampirism, it created myriad copies of him, scattered across the planes. All believe they're the real Jander, though an improbable number of them have already achieved semi-tragic ends. At least one Jander remains trapped in Ravenloft, forever seeking a peace he'll never deserve.

## Jander Sunstar's Traits

Ideal. "Vampirism is a curse that must be eradi-cated-from myself most of all."
Bond. "I will suffer nobly, enduring my curse so I can bring about an end to history's greatest scourge."
Flaw. "My insights and pain carry more weight than those of younger, more naive beings."

## Adventures with Jander Sunstar

Jander Sunstar is a vampire and one of Ravenloft's foremost experts on vampirism. He aids characters hunting vampires and recruits allies to protect him from others of his kind. Consider the following plots when featuring Jander Sunstar in an adventure:

- Jander needs assistance in destroying another vampire: one of his duplicates.
- Jander asks the characters to help him save a monster hunter who opposes an overly powerful foe. Within the villain's lair, the characters discover the hunter is Jander's daughter, Savra, who neither requests nor requires aid.


## LARISSA SNOWMANE

Captain Larissa Snowmane pilots the paddleboat River Dancer along the rivers and coasts of Ravenloft's domains, righting wrongs and ferrying those in need to new homes. Larissa is a legend, known for her icy-white hair, dancing skill, and mezzosoprano signing voice. As she approaches her seventieth year, she remains one of the domains' most widely traveled explorers. When danger threatens her vessel and crew, Captain Snowmane reluctantly uses a magical performance known as the Dance of the Dead, a forbidden song and dance that keeps Undead creatures at bay but slays living beings who witness it, then reanimates them as zombies. Larissa avoids rival riverboat captain Nathan Timothy and his ship, Virago, as well as the swampy domain of Souragne, where she learned her deadly magic from grim forces that consider her debt unpaid.

## LARISSA Snowmane's Traits

Ideal. "Everyone needs help from time to time. I'll help those who have no one else."
Bond. "My ship, my crew, and those in my care are my home, and I'll risk my life to protect them."
Flaw. "I've seen terrors but have risen above them. I can triumph over any evil-except my past."

## Adventures with Larissa Snowmane

Larissa Snowmane is a human druid with exceptional insight into navigating the waterways of the Mists. Her handsome, multilevel paddleboat River Dancer provides an exciting base of operations for wayfaring adventurers. Consider the following plots when featuring Larissa Snowmane in an adventure:

- River Dancer appears when the characters desperately need to escape a domain, but the Mists make their next stop even more dangerous.
- River Dancer pulls into port with only Captain Snowmane aboard. Larissa needs a crew, but she doesn't mention that her last crew died when she used the Dance of the Dead.


## RUDOLPH VAN RICHTEN

A scholar and monster hunter, Rudolph van Richten has traveled to dozens of domains, investigating reports of monstrous beings and documenting them in a series of published guides, the best known of which is Van Richten's Guide to Vampires.

---

In fairer days, Rudolph lived with his wife, Ingrid, and son, Erasmus, in their family home outside Rivalis in the domain of Darkon. Brash and recently established as a medical doctor, Rudolph ran afoul of the Radanaviches, a family using Vistani traditions as a cover for brigandage. When the doctor refused to treat one of the family's mortally ill members, the group's leader, Irena Radanavich, ordered her band to kidnap Rudolph's son and then sold the young man to the vampire Baron Metus. Rudolph pursued the Radanaviches, shattered their criminal operation, and brought Irena to justice, but not before suffering her curse: "Live you always among monsters, and see everyone you love die beneath their claws." In the weeks that followed, the curse took hold. Before Rudolph could track down and slay Baron Metus, the vampire murdered both Ingrid and Erasmus.
In the decades since, van Richten has hunted monsters and armed others with the knowledge they need to confront the dark. Though he's made many devoted allies, he keeps them at arm's length, fearing the threat of his curse. When not traveling, van Richten lives out of his herbalist's shop in Mordentshire in the domain of Mordent.

## RudOLPH van Richten's Traits

Ideal. "Evil cannot go unpunished."
Bond. "To protect those I love, I must keep them at a distance and hidden from my enemies."
Flaw. "I am cursed. I will never find peace."
AdVentures with RudOLPH van Richten Van Richten readily provides mentorship to characters devoted to fighting the creatures of the night. To represent him, use the stat block for a priest from the Monster Manual or Rictavio from Curse of Strahd. Consider the following plots when featuring van Richten in an adventure:

- Long ago, van Richten slew a supernatural villain who terrorized a community, but now that evil has returned. The party must seek out the doctor, since only he knows the secret of defeating the creature-hopefully for good this time.
- One of van Richten's foes captures the doctor and uses his name to correspond with adventurers, luring those who would learn his secrets into a deadly trap.


## The Weathermay-Foxgrove Twins

The daughters of the mayor of Mordentshire, Alice Weathermay, twins Gennifer and Laurie grew up as inseparable hellions. Just before their sixteenth birthday, the twins' uncle, renowned monster hunter George Weathermay, returned to Mordent with his fianc√©, Natalia Vhorishkova. The twins realized
that Natalia was manipulating their beloved uncle, eventually exposing her as a werewolf who was using George to pursue one of Mordent's other famous residents, Rudolph van Richten. After the twins saved van Richten and their uncle from the werewolf, both George and van Richten encouraged their investigative instincts, training them as monster hunters.
Ever since, Laurie and Gennifer have been relentless adventurers. Laurie, taking after her uncle, trained in martial techniques to combat the undead. She rarely travels without her companions Joan and Tirran, the grown pups of her uncle's foxhounds, and her uncle's magic sword, Gossamer.
Gennifer, working closely with van Richten, learned the medicine and traditions of numerous domains. She's conducted in-depth studies of lycanthropy to assist her and her sister in pursing Natalia Vhorishkova, who remains at large. Secretly, Gennifer fears she's infected with lycanthropy, and despite never exhibiting any signs of the curse, she takes medication of her own concoction to ward it off.

## Gennifer's Traits

Ideal. "There's a solution for everything; I just have to be clever enough to see it."
Bond. "My family has endured so much, and now I have to hold my own."
Flaw. "I'll never be as strong as my relatives, so I'll have to be smarter."

## Laurie's Traits

Ideal. "There's a solution for everything. I just have to take your chance when it arises."
Bond. "Deeds, not words, will maintain my family's respected place in society."
Flaw. "I'll never be as smart as my relatives, so I'll have to be stronger."

## Adventures with the Twins

Gennifer and Laurie are skilled and well-prepared adventurers who have the statistics of a druid and a veteran, respectively. Consider the following plots when featuring the twins in an adventure:

- The characters have gotten in over their heads, and the Weathermay-Foxgrove twins-pursuing the same quest-come to the rescue. Afterward, the sisters encourage the party to participate in a training expedition to an infamous locale.
- Gennifer has vanished. Laurie seeks aid, fearing that Natalia Vhorishkova kidnapped her. In truth, Gennifer's fear of turning into a lycanthrope has led her to head off on her own-and into greater danger.
