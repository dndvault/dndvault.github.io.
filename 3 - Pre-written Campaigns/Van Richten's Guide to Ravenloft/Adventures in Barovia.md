# Adventures in Barovia

Count Strahd von Zarovich casts a shadow no matter where heroes tread in Barovia, and sooner or later, they'll face an inevitable showdown with the land's vampiric overlord. The domain's innumerable evils all ultimately tie back to Strahd. Any corrupt individual, sinister cult, or rampaging monster might have been inspired by the Darklord, their evil ultimately furthering the count's plots and infamy.
Strahd's depravity takes physical form in the vampire's lair, Castle Ravenloft. The castle is itself a notorious legend intrinsic to the count's terror. The Mists often deposit strangers to Barovia within sight of the fortress, daring the unwary to approach. Ultimately, only the bravest lay siege to the castle or accept the count's invitations to visit him there. But Castle Ravenloft needn't be challenged in a single assault, and defeating Strahd might not be the only goal of those who enter. The library, chapel, and catacombs of Castle Ravenloft all hold tempting secrets that might be vital to countering the count's plots or undoing other evils. Or Strahd might make good on an invitation to grant guests shelter and safety within the Castle Ravenloft-for a time. Ultimately, don't hesitate to employ the setting's most infamous castle even if you don't plan to run a lengthy siege.
The adventure Curse of Strahd explores Barovia and Castle Ravenloft in detail, but you can also use the ideas on the Barovia Adventures table to create your own plots.

7 From the ruined mansion of Argynvostholt, the revenant knight Vladimir Horngaard dragoons innocents into the Order of the Silver Dragon and pits them against Strahd's servants.
8 The characters are accused of a crime. Surprising everyone, word arrives that Count Strahd von Zarovich will serve as their judge.

## InCarnations of Tatyana

The curse that engulfs Barovia means that the soul of Tatyana, the subject of Strahd's obsession, perpetually reincarnates into new physical forms. No matter what form she takes, Strahd unceasingly seeks her, determined to possess her and soothe his rejected ego. The following section explores creating stories with Tatyana's latest incarnation at their center. This incarnation-whether an unwitting innocent, a determined vampire, a villain, or something else entirely-influences both Strahd's and the characters' relationship with her. Consider how changing Tatyana's incarnation allows you to give your own distinct spin to Ravenloft's classic tale.
Characters and groups marked with an asterisk on the following tables are further detailed in the "Travelers in the Mist" section at the end of in this chapter.

## Who Is Tatyana?

When building your version of Tatyana, use the Tatyana's Incarnation table to determine the character's basic description. Once you're satisfied, consult the following "Connection to Strahd" section to determine the incarnation's relationship to Barovia's Darklord. Alternatively, if you wish Tatyana's incarnation to appear outside Barovia and potentially lead adventurers to Strahd's domain, consider the plots in the "Beyond Barovia" section.

## Tatyana's Incarnation

## d8 Who Is Tatyana's Newest Incarnation?

1 Ireena Kolyana, the adopted daughter of burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich of the village of Barovia

8 Quentin L'Argent, the dragonborn son of human goat herders living near the ruined manor Argynvostholt.

## Connection to Strahd

Once you know what form Tatyana's current incarnation takes, consider how the character feels toward Barovia's Darklord. If your version of Tatyana wants to stay away from Strahd, whether or not the incarnation knows they possess Tatyana's soul, roll on the Avoiding Strahd table. Alternatively, if they're compelled to destroy Strahd, roll on the Hunting Strahd table.

## Beyond Barovia

It's not necessary to have Tatyana's incarnation appear within Barovia. Rather, Tatyana's spirit might arise in another land or under strange circumstances. The Lost Tatyana table provides suggestions for such characters and their objectives.

## Lost Tatyana

## d6 Resurrection Circumstances

1 Tatyana's incorporeal spirit assembles and haunts heroes whom she believes have the best chance of defeating Strahd.
2 A character's friend or loved one is the incarnation of Tatyana. When the Mists claim that individual, the character is drawn into Barovia as well.
3 A character's own reincarnation allows Tatyana's soul to enter their body, bringing with it memories in the form of vivid dreams.
4 Tatyana's soul was captured by an effect similar to the magic jar spell. Strahd or another entity hires the characters to seek out the container holding the soul, not revealing its true nature.
5 Tatyana's soul reincarnated as someone another Darklord covets, such as the bearer of Ankhtepot's ka in Har'Akir or Elise in Lamordia (both detailed later in this chapter).
6 Tatyana's soul found its way into a distant relative of Strahd, Lyssa von Zarovich. Lyssa seeks to grow more powerful and claim Castle Ravenloft for herself. Her first step to deposing Strahd was to become a vampire. Now she needs allies.

Tatyana might be reborn in any number of GUSES, SICH as IREENA KOLYANA OR LYSSA VON ZAROVICH.
