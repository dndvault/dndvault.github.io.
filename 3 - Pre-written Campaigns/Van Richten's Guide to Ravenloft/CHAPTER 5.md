# CHAPTER 5

## MONSTERS OF RAVENLOFT

UNTOLD TERRORS HAUNT THE DOMAINS OF Dread. Among them skulk nightmares known on countless worlds, but even familiar monsters can take on twisted forms or demonstrate unexpected abilities. This chapter explores ways to help you, the DM, make even the most commonplace monsters more frightening, as well as providing a host of horrors to add to your adventures in the Mists.

## Horror Monsters

For adventurers who regularly face terrifying monsters, it's easy for familiarity to sap the frightfulness from terrible foes. Restoring mystery and menace to even the most ordinary monsters can be a simple matter, though, and enhances the atmosphere of horror adventures. Six simple techniques can transform a stat block straight out of the Monster Manual (or other source) into a horror to haunt your characters' dreams:
Monstrous Origins. Monsters in Ravenloft can be every bit as unique as player characters.
Notorious Monsters. A monster is more frightening when its reputation precedes it.
Describing Monsters. Give yourself permission to dwell on a monster's description.
Monstrous Tactics. Monsters that fight dirty-or in a particularly fearsome way-have more impact.
Monstrous Traits. Simple tweaks to a monster's stat block can enhance its horror.
Monstrous Minions. Simple traits can reflect a monster's relationship to the evil master it serves.

## Monstrous Origins

A variety of explanations, from transformative curses to magical experiments, can justify the appearance of a unique individual with unusual traits. In the same way, monsters in Ravenloft don't need to be members of a species or society. You can have a vicious merrow living under a bridge or a yuan-ti abomination Darklord without having to explain merrows as a species or the nature of all yuan-ti in the setting. Monsters can be one-off flukes of nature or the products of insidious magic.
For significant adversaries, use the tables in the "Genres of Horror" section of chapter 2 to inspire you as you craft a monster's unique details. When it comes time for the final confrontation, it might not
matter whether the bridge-haunting merrow was the product of an amoral experiment to infuse piscine traits into a soldier or the result of someone drinking from a spring tainted by demon's blood; the merrow's stat block remains the same. But those different origin stories suggest completely different paths for adventurers to follow when investigating the creature and ensuring nothing like it ever returns to be a menace again.

## Notorious Monsters

Every monster tells a story. The more you treat monsters as unique individuals and foreshadow their threat, the larger they'll loom in characters' minds. Build dread by giving monsters reputations that suggests their form, deeds, or peculiarities while letting players' imaginations embellish details.
For example, tales describe a horrifying skeletal figure that corrupts the land wherever it walks. Its habit of whistling cheerfully while committing brutal acts is the source of its epithet: the Whistling Fiend. Characters might hear rumors of its merry tunes becoming fearful earworms for those who survive its passing. A party seeking the monster might also hear the whistling long before they confront the fiend. All that time, they can at guess at their enemy's nature, but ultimately the Whistling Fiend might be any demon or other threat you choose.
The Whistling Fiend's notoriety has little to do with its stat block. It's famous because of its habit of whistling amid acts of terrible carnage. Use the tables in chapter 4 of the Dungeon Master's Guide to help inspire similar characteristics to color a monster's notorious reputation.

## Describing Monsters

When adventurers encounter a monster for the first time, especially if its reputation precedes it, dwell on its description. You could tell the players that they see a merrow or hold up the creature's picture from the Monster Manual. But that first moment of revelation is the best time to paint a horrifying picture of the monster in the players' imaginations. In addition to the techniques described in the "Running Horror Games" section of chapter 4, consider these concepts as you describe a monster:

---

Emphasize Wrongness. Focus on the features that make the creature alien, inhuman, and out of place. The Whistling Fiend looks like a humanoid skeleton dripping its own gelatinous musculature. Its skull curves to a point suggestive of a sickle.
Engage All the Senses. Describe elements of the creature that are likely to provoke a visceral response, such as the smell of rot that its oily flesh exudes, the whistled tune of a well-known nursery rhyme issuing from its lipless mouth, and the unnatural heat that forms ripples in the air around it. These details don't need to rely on grotesque descriptions. Sometimes it's a contrast between mundane and terrifying details that stands out, like a monster's soulful eyes or pearly teeth set amid vicious features.
Make it Personal. There's a fine line here: Don't dictate a character's actions in response to what they see. But you can touch on the feelings that the creature provokes, leaving it up to the players to describe how they respond to those feelings. Your gut twists in revulsion. The acrid air stings your nostrils. You're suddenly aware of how small and hollow your dreams are in a world that can spawn beings of pure evil.

## Monstrous Tactics

Monsters, just like player characters, can try anything you can imagine in combat, including the full range of combat options described in the Player's Handbook. Monsters can use the Help action to aid each other, they can grapple or shove their enemies, and so on. Some monsters use these options to maximize their advantages in battle; others use them to sow fear among their enemies, even if they're not strategically optimal choices.
For example, creatures known as "goblyns" in Kartakass and other domains are ordinary hobgoblins in terms of their game statistics, but they're known for a tactic they call "feasting": they grapple their enemies and then make unarmed attacks to bite their faces. These attacks aren't terribly dangerous (a hobgoblin's unarmed strike deals only 2 damage, compared to the average of 5 it deals with a longsword), but the face-biting is much more shocking to the victim and onlookers.
Monsters become more fearsome if they use tactics like ganging up on the least-armored characters in a party, taking the time to take bites from unconscious foes, separating party members from each other, and attacking from hiding. Use these tactics judiciously; the goal is to surprise and scare the players, not to convince them that you're trying to make them fail.

The Whistling Fiend is notorious for being heard long before it's seen.

## Monstrous Traits

Consider undermining players' expectations about what a creature is or can do by making tweaks to the traits in its stat block. Adding a sahuagin's Blood Frenzy trait to a different monster can help it feel like a bloodthirsty horror, for example. Traits such as a troglodyte's Chameleon Skin or a doppelganger's Ambusher can help make a monster feel more sinister as it lurks in hiding and ambushes its foes. Some traits, such as a night hag's Etherealness or an imp's Invisibility, can help a monster escape from an encounter so it can return to haunt the adventurers another day. Traits such as a banshee's Horrifying Visage or a black dragon's Frightful Presence can heighten the inherent fearsomeness of truly terrifying creatures.
Of course, you're not limited to the traits that appear in existing monster stat blocks, but those are a good starting point. Feel free to invent your own.

---

## Monstrous Minions

In the Land of the Mists, many monsters serve as minions or manifestations of more powerful villains. To reflect a minion's relationship to its Darklord master or other sinister forces, add one or more of these traits to a monster's stat block.
Alien Mind. If a creature tries to read the minion's thoughts, that creature must succeed on a Intelligence saving throw with a DC equal to $10+$ the minion's Intelligence modifier or be stunned for 1 minute. The stunned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
Minion's Mind. The minion can't be compelled to act in a way contrary to its master's instructions.
Sacrificial Minion. When the minion dies, its master regains hit points equal to four times the minion's challenge rating, as long as the master is within 100 feet of it.
Selfless Bodyguard. When an attack hits its master and the minion is within 5 feet of its master, the minion can use its reaction to make the attack hit itself instead.
Telepathic Minion. The minion and its master can communicate telepathically with each other, as long as they are on the same plane of existence.

## Creating Unique Nightmares

Once you've considered the techniques in this section, put them all together to create your own unique terror. If you have ideas about what you want your monster to do, write them down. Then think of what stories connect the pieces you want to use or fill in gaps you don't know about yet.
For example, perhaps you've got an idea for a troll that ambushes adventurers while they rest. Considering its origins and appearance, the troll literally being a troll isn't important to you; you're more interested in that general challenge and look for the creature. To make your troll feel notorious, you think of what would scare adventurers-where they're vulnerable and what they're sensitive about. You come up with an idea for a creature that can come from anywhere, maybe even within the adventurers' own gear. With tactics and traits in mind, you think of your troll as an abductor and give it the Grappler trait of a mimic and the Amorphous trait of a black pudding so it can sneak in anywhere. Finally, you don't think of the troll as a minion, but you give it the Alien Mind trait to reflect its tormented psyche. Then you flesh out its story and give it a name: the Bagman.

The Bagman emerges from a bag of hOLDING TO COLLECT ITS NEXT VICTIM.

## Beware the Bagman

The Bagman is an urban legend about an adventurer who sought to escape doom by abandoning his party and hiding inside a bag of holding. When he tried to leave, though, he became lost amid a constantly increasing number of extradimensional storage spaces. Over time, the strange forces of this magical in-between place transformed the adventurer into a monstrous creature. Now, every night, the Bagman slips out from a random bag of holding. If he doesn't find his home, he drags someone back into the bag with him and leaves behind some trinket from his hidden kingdom of lost junk. Some say that if you speak too loudly over an open bag of holding or whisper "follow my voice" into a magical storage space three times, the Bagman will come for you.
Any character might know the story of the Bagman. What the Bagman is and how you use this urban legend is up to you. Is there truly a Bagman, or is he just a story? If an object vanishes overnight or if someone finds something that isn't theirs in a bag of holding, is the Bagman to blame? Is the Bagman just a monster that preys on adventurers, or is he the Darklord of his own hidden domain? The possibilities for horror adventures are endless, and nowhere-especially not adventurers' gear-is safe.

## Bodytaker Plant

Whether hailing from the stars or sprouting from hidden depths, the malicious vegetation known as bodytaker plants seek to become the dominant form of life wherever they appear. These invasive organisms subvert whole societies by consuming individuals and replacing them with duplicates called podlings. Bodytaker plants view themselves as perfect organisms and seek to dominate the lands where they grow. To their minds, a world would be healthier and more efficient were they in control. Anyone who disagrees either lacks perspective or is fit to serve only as fertilizer.

A bodytaker plant roots deep, spreading near-invisible filaments through the soil. Should any of these fibers survive the plant's destruction, the bodytaker plant regrows after a matter of months. Salting or poisoning the soil where it grew destroys these filaments and prevents the plant from reappearing.

---

## Podlings

Bodytaker plants either capture unsuspecting victims with their vines or accept captives brought to them by their podling servants. In either case, they drag creatures into their central pod, where potent chemicals render the captive comatose. Over the course of hours, the creature is dissolved and its body repurposed into a podling duplicate.

Podling Link. The plant can see through and communicate telepathically with any of its podlings within 10 miles of it.
Rejuvenation. When the plant dies, it returns to life in the place where it died 1d12 months later, unless the ground where it took root is sown with salt or soaked with poison.
Unusual Nature. The plant doesn't require sleep.

## Actions

Multiattack. The plant makes three Vine Lash attacks.
Vine Lash. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 20 ft ., one target. Hit: $11(2 d 6+4)$ slashing damage. If the target is a creature, it is grappled (escape DC 15). Until the grapple ends, the target is restrained. The plant has four vines, each of which can grapple one target.
Entrapping Pod. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft ., one Medium or smaller creature grappled by the plant. Hit: 22 (4d8 +4 ) acid damage, and the target is pulled into the plant's space and enveloped by the pod, and the grapple ends. While enveloped, the target is restrained, and it has total cover against attacks and effects originating outside the pod. The enveloped target must also immediately succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be stunned by the plant's sapping enzymes until it is removed from the pod or the plant dies. The enveloped target doesn't require air and gains 1 level of exhaustion for each hour it spends in the pod. If the target dies while enveloped, it immediately emerges from the pod as a living podling, wearing or carrying all of the original creature's equipment.

As an action, a creature within 5 feet of the bodytaker plant that is outside the pod can open the pod and pull the target free with a successful DC 15 Strength check. If the plant dies, the target is no longer restrained and can escape from the pod by spending 10 feet of movement, exiting prone. The plant has one pod, which can envelop one creature at a time.

Podlings are near-perfect mimics of the creatures they replace. Despite having the knowledge of those they mimic, podlings frequently miss the nuances of interactions between sapient beings. These duplicates make excuses about their odd behavior, but those familiar with an individual replaced by a podling can often tell something's amiss. Roll on the Podling Behavior table to see what unusual habits a podling might demonstrate.

## Podling Behavior

d6 Behavior
1 The podling abandons the habits and hobbies of the creature it's mimicking.
2 The podling lavishes affection on plants and views houseplants with excessive sympathy.
3 The podling relishes exposing its skin to the sun. It resents clothing and hair.
4 The podling often reacts as if some unseen force is speaking to it, staring into the distance or nodding.
5 The podling often communicates to other podlings using Deep Speech.
6 The podling no longer understands the nuances of a relationship, system, or instrument.

Semblance of Life. The podling is a physical copy of a creature digested by a bodytaker plant. The podling has the digested creature's memories and behaves like that creature, but with occasional lapses. An observer familiar with the digested creature can recognize the discrepancies with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (insight) check, or automatically if the podling does something in direct contradiction to the digested creature's established beliefs or behavior. The podling melts into a slurry when it dies, when the bodytaker plant that created it dies, or when the bodytaker plant dismisses it (no action required).
Unusual Nature. The podling doesn't require sleep.

## BONELESS

Not all animate corpses shamble from their graves. Boneless are undead remains devoid of skeletons. Most rise from the bodies of those who've suffered brutal ends, such as deliberate skinning or crushing. Deathless malice infuses what remains, their husks flopping and slithering in pursuit of vengeance or at the whims of sinister masters. Slipping through cracks and under doors, these stealthy undead seek to adorn living frames once more, wrapping themselves around their victims and wringing them to death in their full-body grip.
Boneless arise in a variety of forms. While the animate skins of specific creatures are the most common, foul spellcasters might create these horrors from the scraps of failed experiments, necromantic slurries, heaps of discarded hair, abattoirs, and charnel concoctions. These origins don't affect a boneless's statistics but lend it distinct forms.
Whether through accident or depraved genius, some villains use one corpse to create two separate undead. Boneless might adorn the frames of other undead, like skeletons or zombies. The sight of a boneless peeling itself from its independently undead frame haunts the nightmares of many seasoned monster hunters.

Compression. The boneless can move through any opening at least 1 inch wide without squeezing. It can also squeeze to fit into a space that a Tiny creature could fit in.
Unusual Nature. The boneless doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

## Actions

Multiattack. The boneless makes two Slam attacks. If both attacks hit a Large or smaller creature, the creature is grappled (escape DC 13), and the boneless can use Crushing Embrace.
Slam. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft ., one target. Hit: $5(1 \mathrm{~d} 4+3)$ bludgeoning damage.
Crushing Embrace. The boneless wraps its body around a Large or smaller creature grappled by it. While the boneless is attached, the target is blinded and is unable to breathe. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw at the start of each of the boneless' turns or take $5(1 \mathrm{~d} 4+3)$ bludgeoning damage. If something moves the target, the boneless moves with it. The boneless can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement. A creature, including the target, can use its action to try to detach the boneless and force it to move into the nearest unoccupied space, doing so with a successful DC 13 Strength check. When the boneless dies, it detaches from any creature it is attached to.

## Actions

Chill Touch (Cantrip). Ranged Spell Attack: +6 to hit, range 120 ft., one creature. Hit: 13 (3d8) necrotic damage, and the target can't regain hit points until the start of the brain's next turn. If the target is Undead, it also has disadvantage on attack rolls against the brain until the end of the brain's next turn.
Mind Blast (Recharge 5-6). The brain magically emits psychic energy in a 60 -foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 14 Intelligence saving throw or take $17(3 \mathrm{~d} 8+4)$ psychic damage and be stunned for 1 minute. A stunned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

At will: detect thoughts, mage hand, zone of truth
3/day each: charm person, hold person
1/day each: compulsion, hold monster, sleep (3rd-level version),
Tasha's hideous laughter.

## CARRION STALKER

A carrion stalker begins life as a pale larva that infests a corpse. Over the course of weeks, this grub burrows, feeds, and grows, ultimately developing into a chitinous mass of pincers and tentacles. When an adult carrion stalker detects movement, it bursts from its corpse-cradle to attack, intent on implanting its young into the living and starting its species' life cycle anew.
More than one necromancer has animated a corpse infested with carrion stalker larvae. While this can prove shocking and deadly, some depraved spellcasters cultivate carrion stalkers within zombies. The embedded carrion stalkers ride along in their freshly animated conveyances, bursting forth once they detect living creatures nearby. This destroys the zombie, but unleashes a new horror.
Carrion stalkers also enjoy symbiotic relationships with carrion crawlers. Carrion crawlers won't devour bodies infested by carrion stalkers, but they often pick up stalker larvae as they root among filth. The crawlers then spread these grubs, potentially infecting whole sewers, graveyards, or battlefields with carrion stalkers. In return, carrion stalkers avoid preying on carrion crawlers.

## Actions

Multiattack. The carrion stalker makes three Tentacle attacks. If it is attached to a creature, it can replace one Tentacle attack with Larval Burst, if available.
Tentacle. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft ., one creature. Hit: $5(1 \mathrm{~d} 4+3)$ piercing damage, and the carrion stalker attaches to the target and pulls itself into the target's space.

While attached, the carrion stalker moves with the target and has advantage on attack rolls against it.
A creature can use its action to try to detach the carrion stalker and force it to move into the nearest unoccupied space, doing so with a successful DC 11 Strength check. On its turn, the carrion stalker can detach itself from the target by using 5 feet of movement. When it dies, the carrion stalker detaches from any creature it is attached to.
Larval Burst (1/Doy). The carrion stalker releases a burst of larvae in a 10 -foot-radius sphere centered on itself. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned. A creature poisoned in this way takes 7 (2d6) poison damage at the start of each of its turns as larvae infest its body. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Any effect that cures disease or removes the poisoned condition instantly kills the larvae in the creature, ending the effect on it.
If a creature is reduced to 0 hit points by the infestation, it dies. The larvae remain in the corpse, and one survives to become a fully grown carrion stalker in 1d4 weeks. Any effect that cures diseases or removes the poisoned condition that targets the corpse instantly kills the larvae.

## CARRIONETTE

Carrionettes arise from innocent intentions. Heartfelt wishes breathe life into a beloved toy and, for a time, a creator might feel blessed by their new companion. But carrionettes aren't content to live as toys and seek to escape the confines of their diminutive bodies.
Every carrionette possesses a silver needle that pins its soul to its body. By posing as simple toys or hiding their desires, a carrionette gets close to an unsuspecting victim. It then uses its needle to swap souls with the victim, stealing the victim's body while trapping the victim's soul in its own doll-like frame. The carrionette then imprisons its old body, keeping the animate doll hidden while it explores the world in its stolen guise-often that of the very person who wished the carrionette into being.
Carrionettes might appear as any type of toy or piece of art. While marionettes and porcelain dolls are the most common, all manner of deadly stuffed animals, crawling jack-in-the-boxes, bloodthirsty poppets, murderous jewelry box ballerinas, and so forth might be carrionettes. These malicious toys are skilled deceivers and, despite some having existed for generations, often affect unsettlingly childlike personalities. Among the most notorious of these terrors is the carrionette Maligno, Darklord of the domain of Odaire (detailed in chapter 3).

False Object. If the carrionette is motionless at the start of combat, it has advantage on its initiative roll. Moreover, if a creature hasn't observed the carrionette move or act, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to discern that the carrionette is animate.
Unusual Nature. The carrionette doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

## Actions

Silver Needle. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft ., one creature. Hit: 1 piercing damage plus 3 (1d6) necrotic damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 12 Charisma saving throw or become cursed for 1 minute. While cursed in this way, the target's speed is reduced by 10 feet, and it must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from each ability check or attack roll it makes.
Soul Swap. The carrionette targets a creature it can see within 15 feet of it that is cursed by its Silver Needle. Unless the target is protected by a protection from evil and good spell, it must succeed on a DC 12 Charisma saving throw or have its consciousness swapped with the carrionette. The carrionette gains control of the target's body, and the target is unconscious for 1 hour, after which it gains control of the carrionette's body. While controlling the target's body, the carrionette retains its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. It otherwise uses the controlled body's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.
If the carrionette's body is destroyed, both the carrionette and the target die. A protection from evil and good spell cast on the controlled body drives the carrionette out and returns the consciousness of both creatures to their original bodies. The swap is also undone if the controlled body takes damage from the carrionette's Silver Needle.
