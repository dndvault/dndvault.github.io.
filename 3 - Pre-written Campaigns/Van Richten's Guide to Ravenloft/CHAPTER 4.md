# CHAPTER 4

## HORROR ADVENTURES

CREATING YOUR OWN HORROR ADVENTURES is like crafting any other D\&D adventure with one exception: your goal is to horrify your players in the most fun way possible. Frightening adventures benefit from an atmosphere of dread, conceived through a combination of terrifying narratives, dramatic presentation, and game elements encouraging fear. Drawing out the anxiety and anticipation of players requires deliberate consideration, though. The tools and techniques in this chapter provide ways to make sure your game is both spooky and safe in ways right for your specific group. A toolbox of horror-focused rules also provides options for what sort of grim adventures you might create. At the end of this chapter, a horror adventure puts these methods to use and leads characters on their first steps into the Domains of Dread.

## Preparing for Horror

Before you run a horror game, consider the following steps to ensure the willingness and full engagement of your players. If a group gathers to play a fun, low-stakes adventure but is immediately thrust into unexpected horror, the game can feel like a trap. You should avoid this. Rather, set expectations with your players about what a horror-focused game means, and determine what topics and themes will encourage or discourage players' participation.

## Understanding Horror

Your primary goal as a DM running a horror adventure is to facilitate a fun D\&D experience. This book assumes you and your players enjoy the thrill and suspense of scary stories. The audience of a horror movie can enjoy the menace on screen because they know it can't harm them (and they have an idea of what to expect from the film's trailer). In the same way, your players count on you to make sure an adventure's terror doesn't target them personally or otherwise step beyond the game. Your goal is never to make players feel uncomfortable or threatened. As D\&D adventures aren't scripted, unexpected elements can arise during play. If your whole group can agree to the terms outlined in this section, everyone should have an exciting, enjoyable experience.

## Set Expectations

Well before you assemble a group around a game table, pitch the adventures you're thinking about running to your prospective players. Note the types
of conflicts that might arise, the tone, and major themes. Telling players what to expect prepares them as they imagine what sorts of characters they could create and launches conversations about content to be embraced and avoided. You don't need to reveal the major plot points or twists in your story, but share the kinds of monsters and general themes you're interested in using, other horror stories you're inspired by, and which genres of horror from chapter 2 interest you. Being transparent with your players allows them to decide if this is a game they want to play, which is best to know before play begins.

## Horror Content Survey

Take advantage of the time before your first game session to learn about your players' thoughts related to horror adventures. To do this, create a brief list of questions focused on the following topics. After preparing this survey, distribute it to your players as an e-mail, physical handout, or otherwise before gathering to play. Keep the survey's results anonymous, but use them to guide what sort of adventures you'll create.

## Content and Themes Questions

Start your survey by listing common story and horror elements to determine your players' comfort with them. The following list is not exhaustive; customize your list to include elements you imagine could arise during adventures. End the list with a space where players can add other topics to avoid or that they're interested in. For each of these topics, ask whether it should be included or avoided:

- General phobias and common fears, such as clowns, needles, or spiders
- Descriptions of gore or visceral violence
- Romantic in-character dialogue
- Themes of mental and physical health involving the body and the mind
- Real-world religion and politics, or analogs of them
- Topics related to real-world social or cultural injustices and discrimination
- Game-specific content, such as dangers, monster types, and setting details you might use
- Specific genres of horror, like those in chapter 2

If you're not comfortable adding any of these topics to your game, don't include them as options, and use them as the starting point for a list of elements that your adventures won't include.

---

## Serious Fear

Many horror D\&D games are spooky romps not too different from typical D\&D adventures. Others venture into more unsettling territory. You and the players should decide what level of intensity is right for your horror adventures. This section provides guidance that applies whether your adventures are morbid comedies or explorations of mature themes. The advice here emphasizes structures that work for all players, including those with different tolerances for being scared or who have certain topics that are off-limits for them. Always consider what you can do to make players feel comfortable with your game, even if no one entirely knows how the horror might unfold. Never assume you know your players' deepest fears-no matter how long you've been roleplaying with them.

## Gameplay Questions

After your list of topics, use the following questions to query players about gameplay considerations:

- How scary do you want the game to be? Do you enjoy being creeped out as a player, or should the characters alone experience fear?
- How difficult do you want the game to be? Should there be a high, average, or low threat of death?
- How do you feel about effects that take away your ability to control what your character does?
- Do you want to allow phones or other distractions at the game table, or should they be set aside?
- Are there any specific stories or rules you'd like to see highlighted during the game?
- Are there general events or experiences you don't want to see during the game?
- Do you have any accessibility needs that would make the game more enjoyable, such as captions for video calls or a specific kind of seating?
- Do you have any other notes or concerns?

Once you've completed this survey, distribute it to your players, give them a window of time to respond, then collect the results. Use this information to inform your adventure planning and to create an anonymized list of content that will not be featured in your game. Bring this list to your session zero.

## SESSION ZERO

After you learn what topics your players are excited about, it's time to discuss what you've learned with your potential players during a preliminary, be-fore-play gathering or "session zero." Tasha's Cauldron of Everything outlines how to run session zero discussions, but in general, use this session to discuss the game's content, social contract, and house rules, and to create characters.

## ReInforge Expectations

Make it clear that D\&D is a group storytelling game. As the DM, you have a role in crafting adventures and arbitrating rules, but you aren't solely responsible for how much fun the group has. Everyone is responsible for the group's enjoyment of the game. By the same token, the whole group has a role in determining how scary the game is and how far that frightful content goes. Chapter 1 provides guidance for players participating in horror adventures. Make sure you and the players are aware of this and use it to inform character creation and play.

## Establish Boundaries

Review your takeaways from the content surveys. Then, informed by players' survey responses, present your list of content the game will not feature. These are your game's boundaries and will not be included. Emphasize that boundaries aren't negotiable, and neither you nor any of the players should bring them into the game.
Note that boundaries may change during play. Encourage players to bring any additions to you, privately or in the moment, so you can add them to the list. When this happens, don't refer to past survey data, defend past choices, or ask players to explain their boundaries. Trust that players know their needs best, and update the game accordingly.
Let players know that this list of boundaries will be accessible during every session and that by playing, they agree to respect these boundaries. Make it clear that players who don't respect these boundaries will have to leave the game.

## Customize Your Experience

During session zero, the group can discuss ways to customize the game in the following ways:
Discuss Genre. If there are horror genres that players gravitated toward in the survey, see if there are elements players would like to use to inspire their characters.
Discuss Campaign Themes. If you already have ideas for the sorts of adventures you plan to run or your own Darklord and domain, share the general concepts you're interested in and see what players get excited about.
Create Player Characters. If players want to discuss their characters or create them collaboratively, now is a great time to do so.
Choose Optional Rules. If there are optional rules-like those presented later in this chapterthat you're amenable to using, determine which ones work best for the group.

## Running Horror Games

While preparing and running frightening adventures, keep in mind the ebb and flow of suspense. Atmosphere, pacing, description, and player involvement all influence a game's tension and directly contribute to how scary your adventures feel.

## Horror Atmosphere

Atmosphere is the overall mood of your game. It's the sense of levity, excitement, or dread that stems from a story's content and players' perception of it. Atmosphere can be challenging to build and easy to disrupt, but any D\&D game-particularly scary games-benefit from your work to cultivate an atmosphere consistent with the experience you're trying to create. Consider the following elements to influence your game's atmosphere and create moody trappings for your horror adventures. Customize what you can and don't fret about what you can't.

## Accessibility

When choosing the space you'll be playing in, review any accessibility needs communicated in the content survey. Accommodate what you can; communicate what you can't as early as possible. Enlist players for help. Players may have difficulty with low light, loud background music, small printed text, strong odors, cramped spaces, specific allergens, or challenges with programs (if playing online). If any player identified these as an issue, don't use them to create an unnerving atmosphere. Recognize the difference between creating a moody atmosphere and making it difficult for players to participate.

## Location

If possible, play in an area with minimal visual or auditory distractions. Favor surroundings that appropriately reinforce your desired atmosphere and have little non-player traffic. If space is shared, negotiate with non-players to reserve the space in advance. You can also reduce distracting stimuli by turning screens off, covering decorations, and moving unnecessary objects away.

## Music

Consider what fills the pauses in the game's action or other quiet moments. Lulls breed distractions. Subtle music, though, can fill such instances while reinforcing the game's atmosphere. Search for ambient, atmospheric, or instrumental music. Choose options without lyrics and that aren't recognizably tied to popular media. Create playlists in advance. If you can subtly control volume, slowly raise it when you want attention, and lower it when players are talking. Experiment with how volume and tempo influence whether a scene feels subdued or energetic.

## Lighting

Dimming the lights can transform your game space, causing distractions to fade and making it look unfamiliar. If the lighting's easy to control, you might adjust it to suggest a setting's light level. More elaborate techniques might involve using colored lights or using patterned cut-outs to cast eerie shadows. Whenever manipulating lighting, though, always ensure players have enough light to read by.

## ProPs

Props can serve as artifacts from your game's world, atmospheric focus pieces, or complete distractions. The first rule of creating props for your game isn't to overdo it. Props can be nice to have, but shouldn't become chores to create, reasons to delay game sessions, or distractions from play. Props can be as simple as a whiteboard for notes or sharing pictures of characters or monsters to increase their memorability. Furniture, whether by its arrangement or removal, can suggest a specific location. Props can even represent game mechanics, such as tracking hit points with crimson flat glass marbles in clear goblets. Ravenloft in particular has a history of featuring props in its adventures (see "Tarokka Deck and Spirit Board" section later in this chapter). The world of creating custom props is endless, but don't compare your game to performances with whole production budgets.

## Distractions

A distraction for one player may be a necessity for another. Discuss compromises that benefit everyone. Maybe food and non-game items are kept away from the play space. Perhaps phones and tablets are permitted as long as they are silenced and used away from the table. Additionally, not everyone is comfortable being photographed or identified in public discussions of a game, whether in real-time or after a session, so ask about the place of social media in the game before making assumptions.

## The Dungeon Master

You have incredible control over your game's tone and atmosphere. Model the behaviors you want players to emulate by staying focused on the game, letting others speak in turn, heading off encroachment on boundaries, and complimenting exciting choices. Stand or pace during intense moments. Speak faster or sound anxious when something scary is happening. Raise the volume of your voice during pitched battles and whisper during tense or conspiratorial moments. Allow yourself to sound uncertain, correct yourself, or pause as if you heard something outside. Ask players, "Are you sure?" Engaging with the suspenseful atmosphere you want to create helps bring it into being around you.

---

## Horror Pacing

Pacing is the speed and energy with which your story unfolds. This relates to the amount of action in your game and, in a horror adventure, the tension or frequency of suspenseful moments. Everything can't be scary, and continuous terror is unsustainable. Before players grow numb to endless tension, create opportunities for them to catch their breath and regain a temporary feeling of calm. The best horror adventures are like roller coasters, ratcheting up suspense and releasing it before building toward the next harrowing moment. Also, mix up social interaction, exploration, combat, and other types of encounters to create interesting and engaging pacing. Ensure that scenes are always somehow relevant to your story and move characters toward their goals.

## Logistics

You often have less time to play than you think once late starts, food breaks, and other interruptions are all taken into account. When planning your adventures, account for less time than your full game session.

## Undermine Reality

Dread and uncertainty are keys to engaging horror adventures. Horrific experiences or supernatural settings undermine assumptions about what can or can't happen. Have a character wake from a prophetic nightmare with a fresh scar. Have a threat characters are fleeing appear ahead of them. Make candles gutter, paintings cry, animals whisper curses, or gigantic eyes peer through windows. Did these things actually happen, or are characters' senses turning against them? The answers often don't matter, particularly when the Mists provide explanations for all manner of casually dreadful impossibilities.

## Idle Uneasiness

Occasionally slow your adventure's pace to draw out the tension you've established. Linger on describing sensory details. Ask players to describe what their characters are thinking, feeling, or fixating on. Detail the ways objects could be used violently, words could be lies, and shadows could hide monsters. Ask players what they think is the worst possible thing that could happen right now. Describe feelings of being watched. Hint that the characters are being hunted. Let characters respond to these stray thoughts. Sometimes these impressions should just be their nervousness getting to them. But sometimes it's the calm before a threat strikes.

## Out of Time

When the time for action comes, make your narration feel urgent. Speak quickly and in short bursts. Focus less on senses and more on descriptions of
impact-a splash of crimson, who knows where it came from? Split the characters' attention. Roleplay other creatures begging, panicking, and trying to escape. Politely demand players react quickly: "There's no time to debate-what do you do?"

## Parallel Scenes

Occasionally encourage players to split the party. When characters are separated, cut back and forth between them. Encourage everyone to watch even scenes their characters aren't in. Keep these split scenes short, and when an exciting event occurs, cut away and make the players wait for resolution. Give characters things to tell one another when they meet again. Players can then decide whether or not their characters trust such reports.

## Reliability and Trust

Reliability and trust are just as important to your horror adventures as lurid shocks. Frequent betrayals encourage paranoia that can paralyze players. Emphasize that certain people and locations will never turn on the characters through repeated positive encounters. The players can trust these allies, but can they keep them safe?

## Just Enough Hope

Fear without hope tempts paralysis and apathy, which can ruin the game. Reward characters who behave dramatically, heroically, or in ways that increase the game's frightful atmosphere. Rewards might include brief scenes focused on a character's actions, opportunities to regroup and rest, clues to adversaries' weaknesses, and discoveries of actual treasure. To maintain character agency, avoid having strangers or allies of the group rescue characters from problems they got themselves into. By the same token, don't throw characters into impossible situations. Never let hope die.

## End on Cliffhangers

Leave players excited to play again. When ending a session, implement one of the following to conclude on a cliffhanger: hint at a new threat, impose a complication on existing plans, increase the stakes, introduce a new mystery, have a foe appear, have the world change, or otherwise shock the characters, then call for a break before players can react.

## Describing Horror

The horrors populating your adventures can take endless forms, whether they be foes, impending events, or magical forces. Rather than just naming what the terrible thing is, inspire your players' imaginations by describing a horror indirectly in stages. Chapter 5 features advice or making familiar monsters more frightful. Also consider the following elements when describing terrors:

---

Before It Arrives. Foreshadow the horror's approach. How do the environment, nearby animals, the weather and nature, and the light and shadows react?
Approaches. What sounds does it make as it moves? What parts do characters see before the whole comes into view?
Up Close. What does it smell like? How does it breathe? Does it cool the air around it or bring heat wherever it goes? How does it stand? When it reaches out to grab a character, what does it feel like?
Attacks. How does it attack? Does it have weapons, or does it use its body to fight? Does it have sharp claws that rake across flesh, or is it a supernatural force that warps what it comes in contact with?
Wounded. When it's wounded, how does it react? What does its blood look like? What is inside it instead of flesh and blood? When it becomes desperate, how does it react?

## Let Players Fill Gaps

Invite players to turn their imaginations against themselves. Leave details intentionally blank, describing just enough to reveal gaps that inspire horrific implications. Fixate on a specific trait, like only describing a vampire's eyes as it attacks.
Alternatively, directly ask players to fill in details. Ask questions like these: What does the way it moves remind you of? It emits the worst smellwhat is it? Something falls free and, for an instant, what are you certain it is? Players' responses don't need to control the narrative; it's up to you whether they're true or just one perception.

## Horror Gameplay

Just as you consider how you'll tell your tales of terror, keep in mind what you can do to make the experience of playing the game more suspenseful.

## Horror Threats

While horror traditionally nullifies heroes' strengths, doing so can remove the players' agency and undercut their enjoyment. Beyond the Dungeon Master's Guide advice for creating dangerous encounters, consider the following techniques to make combat feel more menacing:

- Feature monsters that are immune to tactics characters often use but that are vulnerable to other strategies the characters could employ.
- Have foes spend combat actions doing things that are fundamentally creepy, like chanting to sinister gods or regurgitating their last meal.
- Use another creature as the opening act for the true threat. A notorious monster is all the scarier when it emerges and rips apart something the characters assumed was their true antagonist.


## SubVert Clichés

When characters and worlds feature clichés, they become dull and predictable. If your favorite horror story features outdated tropes, your fondness doesn't redeem them. To create dynamic and compelling characters, consider the following options:

- Avoid drawing inspiration from stock characters in fiction or film.
- Treat characters as real people with real motivations. Put yourself in their shoes. What would you do?
- Show how multiple people from the same culture are different.
- Feature members of different genders, ethnicities, and sexualities, as well as people with disabilities and of varied beliefs, as having broad roles, professions, interests, and outlooks. Endlessly work to quash stereotypes.
- Don't use cliché accents, especially to represent marginalized people.
- Matter-of-factly provide opportunities for everyone to be exceptional. Magical settings bear no resemblance to real-world history, and character creation rules presuppose no standard bar for heroics.
- Have foes play dead, only to "return to life" after characters think things are safe.
- Make use of the techniques detailed in the "Horror Monsters" section of chapter 5.


## Encourage Space

A typical D\&D session is longer than a typical horror movie, and it can be hard to sustain the atmosphere for hours on end. Plan to take breaks during your game session, and encourage players to step away from the table if they need to. If you feel like the game has gotten intense or taken a turn someone's not enjoying, ask, "Is everyone comfortable with continuing?" before proceeding. If anyone's not, thank the players for their honesty and hasten the game to a cliffhanger. Before the next game session, talk with the group about the best way to move
![img-61.jpeg](assets/Van%20Richten's%20Guide%20to%20Ravenloft_img-61.jpeg)

---

forward in a way everyone can enjoy. Work to create a supportive environment where players can admit to being uncomfortable without fearing that they're going to ruin everyone's fun. As DM, you can model this behavior by noting when you're shying away from a creepy idea that comes to you or thanking players who uphold the game's boundaries.
Beyond impromptu checks, once during a session, after a scheduled break, check in with the group and consider asking the following questions:

- What do your characters hope will happen?
- What do your characters worry might happen?
- Do you want to update any content boundaries?
- Is there anything that would make the game more enjoyable for you?


## Ask Permission

Players put considerable thought and investment into their characters. Don't impose rules on characters that might make players not want to play them anymore. For example, characters might gain any of the lineages and Dark Gifts from chapter 1 during play. If there's an opportunity for a character to gain one of these options, ask that character's player if they'd be comfortable with such an adjustment before imposing it. If the player says no, consider other options.
Beyond rules considerations, some actions also require special consideration before they occur in game, such as these examples: romance between characters, violence between characters, one player's character influencing or controlling another player's character, and yelling. All players (including the DM) must ask and gain permission from everyone playing-not just the affected players-before introducing this content. Without any explanation or debate, if a single person gives a thumbs down or doesn't respond, this action shouldn't be performed. Players may change their minds at any time. If a topic was listed as a boundary, it is off the table entirely.

## Content Tools

Content tools enable you and your players to adjust the game's content as you play. Since D\&D is improvisational, the game can go in unexpected directions. If a direction makes the game a worse experience for anyone, use these tools to correct course.
Many content tools exist, but a popular one involves passing a blank note card to each participant,
(including the DM) and instructing everyone to draw an $X$ on their card. One uses their X-Card to signal to everyone else in the game that a boundary has been crossed. If you are playing remotely, players can lift the X to the camera, type X in a chat window, or cross their arms to form an X. In any case, this is a sign that something that just happened is off limits. The person touching the card can comment on what they want adjusted, or whoever's narrating the scene can walk back what just happened, try something else, or leave the scene with a vague ending (like in a film where things fade to black). The person using the content tool doesn't have to explain why the content is objectionable, nor should anyone question it. Instead of a debate, thank the person for being honest about their needs and move on.
Make it clear to players that if a person doesn't feel comfortable using a content tool, they can wait for a break to check in or talk to you privately. Players may also give a friend permission to use the card on their behalf. As the DM, lead by example. Treat content tools seriously and use them to adjust how your shared story plays out.

## Engaging Players

If players seem disengaged, check in with them. Ask them what they would like to see happen next. If they don't know, write two or three options down, hand them the options privately, and ask them to choose one. If issues remain, call for a break, and privately ask what you can do to make the game more engaging.

## After the Horror

It's always a good idea to check in with players at the end of a session, but this rings especially true for adventures where tensions run high and the stories can elicit strong emotional responses. At the end of a horror game session, leave time to check in with players and ask them how the game went, how they're feeling, and what they liked about the session. You might ask the following questions:

- What unsolved mysteries do you want answers to?
- Did you find anything confusing or off-putting?
- What are you looking forward to in the next session?

These answers can help you craft the next session to create a game your players enjoy.
If players give short or vague answers or you suspect that trust at the table has been broken, try creating an anonymous space to receive feedback. It's important to hear honest feedback from players so you can ensure everyone is fully immersed in the story and you can address any issues that might prevent them from enjoying the next game session.

## Tarokka Deck and Spirit Board

Ravenloft has a tradition of adventures featuring setting-specific props and memorable, set-piece encounters. Such atmospheric scenes immerse players in an experience unique to the Land of the Mist. Two fateful tools used in such encounters are detailed here, the tarokka deck and spirit board. Consider including these mystery-steeped props in your own Ravenloft adventures, or use them as inspiration to create other immersive experiences.

## Tarokka Deck

In both 1983's adventure Ravenloft and 2016's adventure Curse of Strahd, the plot changes in accordance with cards drawn from a tarokka deck. A tarokka deck contains fifty-four tarot-like, for-tune-telling cards, each one bearing one of the following symbols:
Crowns. The portentous cards of the high deck are marked with crowns but are not themselves a suit. The figures on these fourteen cards represent distinct forces of fate, change, and despair.
Coins. The ten cards of this suit symbolize avarice and the desire for personal gain.
Glyph. The ten cards of this suit symbolize faith, spirituality, and inner strength.
Stars. The ten cards of this suit symbolize the desire for personal power and control over mysterious forces.
Swords. The ten cards of this suit symbolize aggression and violence.
Tarokka decks allow you run encounters where fortune-tellers predict characters' fates. Once you're familiar with the cards and their meanings, you can interpret them in ways that tie in to the characters' pasts or events in your adventures. You can also use the results of tarokka readings to guide your campaign and make sure predictions come to pass.
The tarokka hails from the same world as the domain of Barovia, but it and its users have since spread throughout the Domains of Dread. Further details and a complete tarokka deck appear in the adventure Curse of Strahd.

## Spirit Board

Spirit boards are tools to contact and divine the will of spirits or other mysterious forces. Upon placing their fingertips on a planchette set atop the board, assembled users feel forces move the planchette toward letters and symbols, gradually revealing a cryptic message. The spirits boards common in the Land of the Mists were first created by members of the Keepers of the Feather (see chapter 3), and feature half-understood images from their occult studies and Barovian lore. These markings include symbols from the tarokka deck, which carry the same meanings as they do upon those cards. All manner of mysterious beings consider a spirit board's use an invitation to communicate with the living, resulting in messages shared from beyond the grave and frightful revelations.
This book's appendix provides a depiction of a spirit board to use in your adventures, while a planchette to be used with it appears here. The adventure "The House of Lament" later in this chapter features séances employing a spirit board. When making use of this game prop, you take the role of the forces guiding the planchette. Move the planchette subtly to reveal mysterious messages appropriate to your adventures.

## Horror Toolkit

Setting the stage for horror isn't entirely a product of good storytelling. As highlighted throughout this book, any rule might take on a terrifying cast, whether you present it as having some grim source or you customize it with ominous new options. This section goes a step further, providing options to make existing rules more terrifying and presenting systems that encourage unique horror experiences.

## CurSEs

An ancient warning echoes in a tomb robber's mind. A lost treasure bears a magical affliction, assuring it remains lost. A dying priest's last breath carries a portent of doom. Curses come in myriad forms, presaging terrifying tales and distinctive dooms.
This section provides guidance for creating dramatic curses, either distinct from or as part of curses resulting from magic, monsters' actions, or other effects. These curses provide ominously poetic responses to fateful choices and afflictions that last until they're alleviated by specific remedies. Spells at the characters' disposal might relieve these curses' effects temporarily but can't lift them completely. The price must be paid.
![img-62.jpeg](assets/Van%20Richten's%20Guide%20to%20Ravenloft_img-62.jpeg)

## Laying Curses

Curses aren't something to throw around lightly. They should be dramatically appropriate responses to meaningful choices characters make. If every goblin or bandit coughs out a dying curse, the narrative impact fades. There should always be a way to avoid a curse, and a curse's effects should clearly arise from wrongdoing. Here are some examples of actions that warrant a curse:

- Defiling a sealed tomb
- Desecrating a temple
- Slaying a villain who is backed by a powerful entity such as a demon lord or a deity
- Murdering or grievously harming an innocent
- Stealing a treasure that is meaningful to an entire culture

In cases where the curse arises from a creature, such as a dying villain's last breath, the pronouncement of the curse is clear. When there is no wronged party present to lay the curse directly, the curse should be obvious in some way, such as a warning of dire consequences carved into the wall of an ancient crypt or relayed by a spell such as magic mouth.

## COMPONENTS OF A CURSE

Most curses have three distinct components: pronouncement, burden, and resolution. Whatever form these take, at least one of them, especially the burden or resolution, should have an ironic connection to the action that triggered the curse.

## Pronouncement

The first component of a curse is the pronouncement, which amounts to a threat. It promises suffering to those who dare to perform or have already performed a specific offensive act. The pronouncement can be a standing warning against taking some action, or it could be a declaration in the moment. The following examples suggest just a few possible pronouncements:

- A widely spread story explaining that a particular action tempts terrible punishment
- A warning spoken on the cusp of a deadly battle, assuring dire consequences for the victorious
- A poem, rhyme, or song foretelling doom
- A carved epitaph on a gravestone discouraging robbers
- The last words of a dying person-either a powerful villain or a wrongly slain innocent
- Swearing a vow to refrain from or undertake some action on pain of great suffering

---

## Burden

A curse's burden is the effect that causes hardship and suffering to the curse's victim. A burden is often reflective of what caused the curse in the first place, twisting the transgressor's action against them. The burden takes effect immediately, along with a vague sense of foreboding-such as a chill down the spine or a wave of nausea. The victim might not notice the curse's effect until a situation arises to make it obvious. For example, a character cursed with clumsiness that manifests as disadvantage on Dexterity checks might not notice anything until they make such a check. Burdens can take many forms, such as the following:

- The victim has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, saving throws, or some combination of the three. This can be tied to a single ability score or applied generally.
- The victim can't communicate using language, whether through speaking, sign language, writing, telepathy, or any other means.
- The victim gains 3 levels of exhaustion that can't be removed while the curse endures.
- When the victim finishes a long rest, they must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, or their hit point maximum is reduced by 1 d 10 . If this reduces their hit point maximum to 0 , the victim dies, and their body crumbles to dust.
- When the victim takes damage, they take an extra 1d10 necrotic damage. This effect can't happen again until the start of the victim's next turn.
- The victim gains a Dark Gift (see chapter 1) appropriate to the circumstances surrounding the curse.
- The victim gains vulnerability to one damage type.
- The victim's Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution score is reduced to 3 , and the victim can't be raised from the dead while the curse lasts.
- A monster hunts the victim relentlessly. Even if the monster dies, it rises again or a new one takes its place 24 hours later.


## RESOLUTION

Sometimes a curse can be ended by making restitution to a wronged party (or their closest kin in the case of a death) or reparation if something was stolen or destroyed. The resolution might be declared as part of the pronouncement, or it may be left to those who suffer the curse to make amends on their own. Research and divination can offer clues or even reveal the exact steps needed to resolve the curse.
While more general curses can lifted by a remove curse spell, more specific or dramatic curses can't be permanently lifted through spells. Magic can offer temporary respite, though. A remove curse spell cast on the victim of such a curse suppresses
the burden for 1 hour. A greater restoration spell suppresses the burden until the victim finishes a long rest. Death usually ends a curse, but the curse returns in full force if the cursed character returns to life without resolving the curse.
Persistent Curses. When a curse is resolved, its effects usually end immediately. Some more insidious curses might linger beyond the resolution but can then be removed by a remove curse spell or similar magic if the victim succeeds on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw when the spell is cast. If the save fails, it can be repeated after a specific interval passes, usually 1 month, with the curse ending on a successful save. Adjust the DC of a particularly weak curse to 10 or that of a stronger one to 20.

Here are some examples of curse resolutions:

- Protecting a loved one dear to the person who laid the curse from some dire threat
- Returning every piece of a stolen treasure hoard, down to the last copper coin, to the place where it once rested
- Slaying the head of a dynasty that has long held power in the region
- Accomplishing a seemingly impossible task, such as raising a castle above the clouds or making the sun cross the sky in a different direction


## Sample Curses

Provided here are several example curses and the circumstances surrounding them. Change the details of any of these examples to customize them to your adventures.

## Ancient Seal

This curse protects the resting place of a long-dead ruler and punishes any who disturb the ruler's remains or plunder the treasures.
Pronouncement. Carved into the stone of the crypt door are the words "Relentless death follows those who disturb the sovereign's rest."
Burden. Each character that gains the curse is hunted by a wraith that appears at sunset and vanishes at dawn, pursuing the single-minded goal of slaying the cursed individual. The wraith manifests in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of its victim. Destroying the wraith grants a temporary reprieve; it doesn't reform for 10 days. You can scale this curse for lower- and higher-level characters by choosing another kind of creature.
Resolution. The cursed character sets right what they disturbed; stolen treasure must be returned, and if the ruler's body was disturbed, it must be reinterred with proper observances.

In Har'Avir, an ancient curse awarens the Children of Ankntepot.

## Broken Vow

A character breaks a solemn vow. The consequences stem from the powers that observed the oath's swearing.
Pronouncement. Whatever vow the character made, it came with an implied warning that guilt and restlessness would beset anyone who broke the oath.
Burden. The character is plagued by restless sleep and recurring nightmares featuring those the character swore to protect. The character gains 3 levels of exhaustion that can't be removed until the curse ends.
Resolution. The curse lasts until the character upholds the broken oath. That might require the character to wait until the circumstances arise again or, more questionably, to engineer the circumstances.

## Final Breath

A deity's favored servant lies dying and calls down divine wrath.
Pronouncement. The dying creature declares to the killer, "May your mind grow dim in battle until the sun sets forever."
Burden. The character has disadvantage on attack rolls brought on by brief, sporadic bouts of confusion.

Resolution. To lift the curse, the character must cause a symbolic setting of the sun or an empowering of the night to appease the slain creature's deity. The character might prevent a festival dedicated to a sun god or perform a ritual that shrouds an entire settlement in magical night for 24 hours, thus ending the curse.

## InNOCENT BLOOD

The tragic situation came to pass where a character killed an undeserving person, who laid a vengeful curse in punishment.
Pronouncement. The dying victim spits final words: "You shall spill innocent blood until laid low by the moon's bite!"
Burden. The character is cursed with loup garou lycanthropy (see chapter 5).
Resolution. This curse can't be broken until the character is reduced to 0 hit points by a silvered weapon. If the character survives, the curse can be broken as described in the "Loup Garou Lycanthropy" section of chapter 5. Treat the character as a werewolf whose loup garou progenitor has been killed.

## Fear and Stress

Terror takes a toll. The ramifications of frightful experiences might be an instant of instinct-triggering shock or a lasting, traumatic echo. The Dungeon Master's Guide presents options for fear and horror to help reinforce terrifying themes in play. This section presents an alternative system, exploring reactions personalized to individual characters and offering incentive for players to embrace roleplaying moments of fear. Options exploring fear provide guidance to create frightening moments for a character outside of spells or monster abilities, while rules for stress model the lingering toll such events can take. None of these options are required to create an enjoyable horror roleplaying experience, but they provide ways to measure the effects of characters facing and overcoming their fears.

## Seeds of Fear

Aside from supernatural sources of dread and monsters who strike terror in their victims, fear is subjective and often quite personal. A battle-hardened warrior and a reclusive scholar might not deal with frightful circumstances in the same way. During character creation, a player can choose up to two Seeds of Fear to represent things their character finds truly frightening. The Seeds of Fear table offers some examples. These can change over time as characters grow, overcome old fears, and discover new uncertainties. Work with players to determine when their Seeds of Fear might change.
A character never has more than three Seeds of Fear; if you gain a new seed and already have three, choose which of your old fears is replaced by the new one.

## Seeds of Fear

d12 Seed
1 "I can't stand dark places."
2 "I'm terrified of a particular kind of animal."
3 "Deep water will be the death of me."
4 "I can't stand heights."
5 "I hate being stuck in tight spaces."
6 "Being around crowds unnerves me, for I always feel judged."
7 "I hate feeling isolated or being alone."
8 "Storms and extreme weather rattle me."
9 "Being followed chills my blood."
10 "Sudden noises or appearances fray my nerves."
11 "I can't be comfortable around creatures larger than I am."

12 "Reflections always seem like they're looking straight through me."

## Using Seeds of Fear

When a character encounters one of their Seeds of Fear, and interacts with the situation in a way that reinforces the seed, such as screaming or stumbling back from a horrid event, consider giving the character inspiration for their fear-focused reaction (see "Inspiration" in the Player's Handbook). Once a character gains inspiration in this way, they shouldn't be able to do so again until they finish a long rest.
For example, imagine that a character has the Seed of Fear "I hate being stuck in tight spaces" and must squeeze through a narrow crack in a cave wall to continue an adventure. If the player portrays the character's response in a way that reinforces that fear, such as refusing and finding another way around, taking time and making noise to widen the crack, or portraying some other fearful response, these would be perfect opportunities to reward the player's consideration of a Seed of Fear by granting their character inspiration.

## Fear

An overwhelming foe or horrid monster doesn't need magic or some supernatural ability to strike fear into the most stalwart adventurers. During any frightful encounter, you can call on a character to make a saving throw to resist being scared. The character must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened until the end of their next turn.
Any of the following circumstances might be reasons to have one or more characters make saving throws to resist being frightened:

- The character experiences one of their Seeds of Fear.
- An enemy is immune to the character's attacks or spells.
- An enemy demonstrates it can deal enough damage to reduce a character to 0 hit points in one blow.
- A creature is alien or monstrous in ways the character never could have imagined.
- An object undermines a character's understanding of reality.

---

## Stress

Charging headlong into terrifying situations is the stock in trade for adventurers. Among the Domains of Dread, though, periods of respite between harrowing experiences can be rare. Even the hardiest adventurers find themselves worn down over time, their performance suffering as they struggle to cope with the dread and despair.
Various circumstances might cause a character stress. Stress can be tracked numerically as a Stress Score, increasing in trying situations and decreasing with care. At your discretion, a character's Stress Score might increase by 1 when one of the following situations occurs:

- A tense, dramatic moment, especially one involving one of a character's Seeds of Fear
- Every 24 hours the character goes without finishing a long rest
- Witnessing the death of a loved one
- A nightmare or darkest fear made real
- Shattering the character's fundamental understanding of reality
- Witnessing a person transform into a horrid or unnatural creature
When a character makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, they must apply their current Stress Score as a penalty to the roll.


## Reducing Stress

A character who spends an entire day relaxing or in otherwise calm circumstances reduces their Stress Score by 1 when they finish their next long rest.
The calm emotions spell effect used to suppress the charmed and frightened conditions also suppresses the effects of one's Stress Score for the spell's duration.
A lesser restoration spell reduces the target's Stress Score by 1, and a greater restoration spell reduces a character's Stress Score to 0.

## Haunted Traps

Like other traps, haunted traps represent threats leveled toward trespassers. They originate in an area spontaneously, often resulting from overwhelming negative emotions, tragedy, or evil. Just as some terrible fates might cause a tormented individual to rise as an undead creature, so might supernatural evil and violent emotions manifest more generally as one or more haunted traps. Such traps provide a way to theme the dangers and monsters of a haunted place to reveal a grim history or frightening tale. When creating haunted traps, consider what events brought them into being and how the trap's effects suggest those origins.

## Detecting Haunted Traps

Every haunted trap has an emanation, which might be as subtle as a drop in temperature or as overt as an object moving of its own accord. A haunted trap's emanation occurs before the trap takes effect. A character notices the emanation if their passive Wisdom (Perception) score equals or exceeds $10+$ the trap's Haunt Bonus. A character who notices the haunted trap has until the start of their next turn to react, which might include fleeing to avoid the trap or attempting to disarm it (see the following section). Class features and spells, such as Divine Sense and detect evil and good, that discern desecration also detect haunted traps.

## Disarming Haunted Traps

Characters who notice a haunted trap before it activates can attempt to disarm it. Typical methods of disarming traps, such as thieves' tools and dispel magic, don't affect haunted traps. However, the Channel Divinity class feature and the remove curse spell can disarm a haunted trap.
To use Channel Divinity to disarm a haunted trap, a character uses an action to present their holy symbol and speak a prayer. To use remove curse instead, a character must cast the spell and touch an object that is part of the trap. Whichever disarming method is used, the trap itself then makes a saving throw against the character's spell save DC, adding its Haunt Bonus to the save. On a failure, the trap is disarmed for 24 hours. If the trap fails the save by 10 or more, the trap is disarmed permanently.
Depending on the haunted trap's origins, certain spells might also affect the trap. For example, a haunted trap with a fiendish origin might be permanently disarmed by the spell dispel evil and good.
Some haunted traps might also be disarmed in nonmagical ways related to the history of a haunted area. Such methods might be as simple as wearing the clothes of a haunted house's former owner or singing a lullaby that soothes a restless spirit.

---

Haunted traps disarmed in such ways typically remain disarmed for 24 hours.

## Sample Haunted Traps

Several haunted traps are presented here in alphabetical order. Customize them to create terrifying traps appropriate for your adventures.

## Danse Macabre <br> Haunt Bonus +4

This haunted trap affects a 20 -foot-radius sphere centered on an ancient but pristine instrument. When a creature enters the area, the trap's emanation manifests as the sound of distant, mournful music. A round later, a phantom performer appears and begins playing the instrument for the next minute. While the performer plays, any creature that enters or starts its turn in the haunted trap's area must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or float 20 feet into the air and be affected by the spell Otto's irresistible dance. There they are joined by illusory dancers as they dance for the remainder of the performer's song. As an action, a dancing creature can repeat the saving throw to end the effect on itself, whereupon it falls 20 feet and takes 2 d 6 bludgeoning damage. If a creature's saving throw to resist the
![img-63.jpeg](assets/Van%20Richten's%20Guide%20to%20Ravenloft_img-63.jpeg)
trap or to stop dancing is successful, the creature is immune to the haunted trap for the next 24 hours.

While the phantom performer plays, any creature within the haunted trap's area can use an action to try to convince the performer to stop playing, doing so with a successful DC 14 Charisma (Persuasion) check. When the performer stops playing, all creatures affected by the haunted trap are freed from its effects and float to the ground safely.

## FACelESS MALICE

## Haunt Bonus +2

This haunted trap affects a 15 -foot-cube in front of an ornate mirror hanging on a wall. When a visible creature enters the area, the trap's emanation manifests as the creature's distorted reflection in the mirror. If that creature is still in the area at the start of its next turn, it must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be blinded, deafened, and rendered unable to speak for 1 minute. Additionally, an illusion makes it appear that the creature has had its face erased. The remove curse spell ends this effect, as does destroying the mirror. The mirror has AC 12,10 hit points, vulnerability to bludgeoning damage, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. After a creature fails its saving throw against the trap, the trap won't activate again for 24 hours.

## ICON OF THE LOWER AERIAL KINGDOMS Haunt Bonus +6

This haunted trap is tied to the 10 -foot-radius sphere surrounding an ominous, 1 -foot-tall statue of a menacing, four-winged, birdlike figure. Once per day, when a creature enters the area, the trap's emanation manifests as the sound of distant flapping wings and a rush of warm air. If that creature is still in the area at the start of its next turn, it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed and incapacitated for 1 minute. These conditions last until the creature is damaged or someone else uses an action to shake the creature. If the affected creature remains charmed for the full minute, they are then affected as per the spell magic jar, their soul entering the statue and being replaced by the spirit of a disembodied fiend. This effect ends when dispel evil and good or a similar spell is cast on the affected creature, or when the statue is destroyed. The statue has AC 17, 15 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.
This haunted trap manifests as the result of a fiendish influence. Casting dispel evil and good on the statue permanently disarms the haunted trap.

---

## Morbid Memory

## Haunt Bonus +0

A morbid memory trap presents little danger, but it proves useful in revealing important and unsettling glimpses into an area's past. This haunted trap affects a single room or 30 -foot-square area. When a creature enters the area, the trap's emanation manifests as faint, disembodied whispers. If that creature is still in the area at the start of its next turn, an illusory scene plays out, repeating some terrible event that happened in the area. This vision typically lasts 1 minute. When the vision ends, all creatures in the area that saw the illusion must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of the area for the next 1d4 rounds. Frightened creatures must take the Dash action and move away from the haunted area by the safest available route on each of their turns, unless there is nowhere else to move. After the haunted trap is activated, it won't activate again for 24 hours.

## Survivors

Terror doesn't come just for the brave and pre-pared-often quite the opposite. Some of the most harrowing horror stories involve the least likely heroes, individuals who find their simple lives transformed into waking nightmares.
In most horror adventures, your players will employ familiar, adventure-ready characters. That doesn't need to be the case, though. Instead, for short, low-power adventures, immersive retellings of tragic events, out-of-body experiences, or other unique tales, consider providing players with temporary, stand-in characters called survivors.
This section provides guidance for using survivors, characters designed for one- to three-session adventures focused on survival rather than saving the day. Using survivors helps create horror experiences focused on the dread inherent to having limited resources and facing impending doom without forcing players to risk their favorite characters.

## Using Survivors

Survivors are premade characters that are simple and easy for players to master, while being customizable enough to fill broad roles in your adventureswhether they be farmers or bored nobles, constables or babysitters. Adventures employing survivors are meant to be asides within broader campaigns or otherwise short experiences.

## Cut Scenes, Dreams, and Memories

Use survivors to provide information to players in the form of a self-contained adventure. Even if it doesn't make sense for a campaign's characters to be present for an event, survivors can provide players with perspectives they wouldn't otherwise have. For example, you might use survivors in the following ways:

- Survivors serve as the first constables on the scene during a serial killer's crime. Afterward, when the players' other characters get involved in the investigations, the players know the details.
- Survivors give every player a part to play in one character's ominous nightmares, such as those resulting from encounters with the mind flayers of Bluetspur (see chapter 3).
- Survivors provide players front row seats to important historic events. It's one thing to hear about the massacre at Castle Ravenloft following Strahd von Zarovich's transformation into a vampire, but it's another to play it.


## Mindtaker Mists

The Mists frequently kidnap characters from across the multiverse, dragging them into the Domains of Dread. They don't always claim their victims bodily, though. Rather, the Mists might steal characters' minds, placing them into survivors involved in specific terrifying scenarios. Perhaps characters suddenly find themselves mentally recast into someone defending against a zombie siege in Falkovnia, attending a ball in Dementlieu, or exploring the tombs of Har'Akir (see chapter 3 for details on such adventures). Whether the characters survive or meet spectacular ends doesn't matter, as death might mean a return to the character's original body, a second chance to try again, or a stranger fate.

## Terrible Freedom, Delightful Doom

Make sure your players know how long you plan to use survivors and that they'll be playing their usual characters again soon. Also let them know that survivors are designed to engage with terrifying circumstances, but their triumph over such threats is not assured. Players' decisions will certainly impact the survivors' fates, but if it seems like doom is in store, encourage the players to embrace it and make sure their survivors meet unforgettable ends.

## What's Old Is New

Dwindling resources contribute to terrifying situations. When a group runs out of hit points, spells, food, or other vital reserves, tension and dread increase. High-level characters, though, have such resources in spades. By running an adventure using survivors, you can recapture some of the same tension adventurers experience early in their careers,

---

encouraging players to use their wits and make desperate choices powerful characters can avoid.

## Tools for Terror

Survivors allow you to control how players will engage with a horror adventure. The stat blocks in the following section are designed to be easy-to-use characters with a hint of talent but little that makes them remarkable:
Apprentices have a minor talent for magic and tend to be well-read.
Disciples faithfully adhere to the tenets of their chosen religions and receive spells from the deities they worship.
Sneaks survive by their wits and are often charlatans or petty thieves.
Squires possess a modicum of martial training and are stalwart companions.

Determine how you want to use survivors in your adventure. If it's important to the story, perhaps all the players use the same stat block, representing their shared experience-a group of Sneaks might all be detectives while a band of Disciples might face a terror unleashed upon a monastery. You can also allow players to choose their own survivors, as any survivor might fill a general role like noble, villager, or sailor with a touch of talent. Make use of these ready-made characters in whatever ways suit your adventure best.

## Creating a Survivor

When you plan a session using survivors, determine how you'll use the Apprentice. Disciple. Sneak, and Squire stat blocks that appear in the following section. Once you've determined what survivors to use, take a few moments to individualize them. If the survivors have particular roles in your adventure, provide that information to players along with their survivors' statistics; otherwise, let them come up with their own details. Players can give their survivors names, personalities, and lineages, but these details don't affect the survivors' stat blocks.

## LEVELS

Survivors don't possess classes as detailed in the Player's Handbook. Despite this, you can make a survivor marginally more powerful by increasing its level. The stat blocks present the survivors as they are at 1st level. Rather than gaining experience points, a survivor increases in level whenever it makes sense for your adventure. When a survivor gains a level, it gains the benefits on the Survivor Progression table. A survivor that advances from 1st to 2nd level and from 2nd to 3rd level gains access to the player's choice of Survivor Talents (see the section below).
![img-64.jpeg](assets/Van%20Richten's%20Guide%20to%20Ravenloft_img-64.jpeg)

For survivors, any foe might become the focus of its own horror adventure.

## Survivor Progression

| Level | Feature |
| :-- | :-- |
| 1st | See the appropriate stat block |
| 2nd | Survivor Talent |
| 3rd | Survivor Talent |

## Hit Points

Whenever a survivor gains a level, it gains one Hit Die and its hit point maximum increases. To determine the amount of the increase, roll the Hit Die (the type that appears in the survivor's stat block), and add the survivor's Constitution modifier. It gains a minimum of 1 hit point per level.
If a survivor drops to 0 hit points, it falls unconscious and subsequently makes death saving throws just like a normal player character.

---

## Survivor Talents

At 2nd level and again at 3rd level, a survivor gains their choice of one of the following talents. A survivor can't gain the same talent more than once, unless a talent's description says otherwise. If a talent has a prerequisite, the character must meet it to gain the talent.

## Adrenaline Surge

At the start of your turn, you can choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. Until the start of your next turn, you are frightened of that creature and your walking speed is doubled.

## Desperate Scream

Whenever you make a saving throw, you can summon your desire to live into a desperate scream. You gain advantage on the saving throw, and the scream is audible up to 100 feet away. You can scream in this way twice, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

## Divine Guidance

Prerequisite: Disciple survivor
You learn one 1st-level spell of your choice from the cleric spell list. It must be a spell you don't already know. You can cast the spell once with this talent, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.
You can select this talent more than once. Each time you do so, you must choose a different spell.

## Magical Talent

Prerequisite: Apprentice survivor
You learn one 1st-level spell of your choice from the wizard spell list. It must be a spell you don't already know. You can cast the spell once with this talent, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.
You can select this talent more than once. Each time you do so, you must choose a different spell.

## Resilience

Choose one ability score. You gain proficiency in saving throws using the chosen ability.

## Sacrificing Shield

Prerequisite: Squire survivor
When a creature you can see makes an attack against a target you can see within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to become the target of the attack instead. If you are wielding a shield, you can reduce the damage by 1 d 10 . Once you use this talent, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

## Skillful

You gain proficiency in two skills of your choice.

## Slip Away

Prerequisite: Sneak survivor
When a creature you can see within 5 feet of you hits you with an attack roll and deals damage to you with the attack, you can use your reaction to give yourself resistance against that damage. You can then move up to half your speed without provoking opportunity attacks. Once you use this talent, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
