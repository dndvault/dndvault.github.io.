# My Friends,

I send this ahead of me with capable souls I'm paying enough to trust. I received your last letter pre-opened. Whatever eyes are fixed on you might be keener than you fear.
Tomorrow I depart on an expedition, one that can't be delayed-perhaps the most important of my life. Thus, I won't be joining you in as timely a manner as l'd like. In my stead, I've sent enough coin to ensure these messengers' assistance and silence for even the most daunting work.
I'm also sending an apology, one this might be my last chance to make. There are a thousand times I wish I'd been better, when I should have spoken not from the past but from my heart. I'm sorry I wasn't more patient and that I never told you how often your bravery and wit dazzled me-and still do. Ez, Laurie, Gennifer, Alanik, Arthur, you're all I have left of family. I haven't said it enough, but I love you all like my own. For what it's worth, I consider you all van Richtens now. My name is yours to use as you please-I pray it brings you more joy than it's brought me. But whatever name you use, I know you'll carry it as a candle to ward off the shadows.

Always,
Doctor Rudolph van Richten
