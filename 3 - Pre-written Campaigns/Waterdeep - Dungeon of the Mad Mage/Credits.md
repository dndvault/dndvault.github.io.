Disclaimer: The Mod Mags of Undermountain is not seeing visitors right now. Don't come down because, uh, we're renovating and everything is a mess. You won't find any treasure, and the buffet is closed until further notice. Ye gods, where did all these githyanki come from? As if the mind flayers weren't bad enough. What's that? You think you can plunder my home and get away with it? Ha! You don't have the experience points.
