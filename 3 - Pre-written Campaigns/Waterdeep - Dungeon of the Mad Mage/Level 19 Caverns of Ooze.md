# Level 19: Caverns of Ooze

![img-35.jpeg](assets/Waterdeep%20-%20Dungeon%20of%20the%20Mad%20Mage_img-35.jpeg)

AMED FOR THE PRIMORDIAL OOZE THAT FLOWS through its naturally formed tunnels and chambers, this cavernous level of Undermountain is designed for four 15th-level characters. Those who overcome its challenges should reach 16th level. Whimsical even by Undermountain's standards, the Caverns of Ooze offer DMs the rare opportunity to sing, should they wish to portray the genies on this level in the vein of characters from an animated feature film.

## What Dwells Here?

Halaster bound two genies to this level and pitted them against one another. The Mad Mage also captured a spelljamming vessel and deposited it here, along with its crew. Finally, the demented followers of an evil god of oozes and slimes make their home here.

## Genies of Earth and Water

A dao and a marid live here, having struck bargains with Halaster to rid level 20 of the lich Ezzat. The genies compete with one another. Whichever one obtains the lich's phylactery wins its freedom, damning the other to spend the remainder of its existence in Undermountain. By the rules of Halaster's game, the genies can use adventurers to get the job done, but they can't cause bodily harm to one another, either directly or indirectly. A disgruntled mud mephit named Urm has been forced to act as the genies' go-between.

## Scavenger Crew

The Mad Mage captured a spacefaring pirate ship called the Scavenger, stole the magic device that propels it, and left the derelict vessel and its crew to rot in the Caverns of Ooze. The ship's mind flayer captain (see "Captain N'ghathrod," page 250) was forced to eat the brains of several shipmates to survive. The remainder of the crew fled into the caverns and have taken refuge in the oozefilled caverns around the ship. Now the illithid waits for new humanoid brains to deliver themselves into its waiting tentacles.

## Worshipers of Ghaunadaur

The Caverns of Ooze have, at various times, served as a temple and sanctuary for worshipers of Ghaunadaur, the evil god of oozes, slimes, and other subterranean horrors. Halaster rewards these mad zealots by transforming them into oozes that retain most of their memories and intelligence. These servants of Ghaunadaur believe the god himself has blessed them. The Mad Mage does nothing to discourage this impression.

Followers of Ghaunadaur whom Halaster lures to Undermountain invariably visit a floating orb that weeps primordial ooze in area 4. The orb is thought to be part of Ghaunadaur himself. His worshipers sometimes refer to the object as the Weeping Eye. In truth, Halaster found the oozing orb and brought it here solely to flood the caverns and mislead Ghaunadaur's vile devotees.

---

## Wandering Monsters

Most of the ooze that flows through this level is harmless elemental waste, but this level is also home to meandering Ghaunadaur worshipers and orog space pirates looking for food. You can use the following encounters to harry restless or resting adventurers.

## Huge Gray Ooze

The characters encounter six Ghaunadaur-worshiping duergar who were transformed by Halaster's magic into a single gray ooze with a challenge rating of $8(3,900$ $\mathrm{XP})$ and these changes:

- The ooze is Huge, with $152(16 \mathrm{~d} 12+48)$ hit points and a Strength score of 18.
- As an action, it can make two attacks with its pseudopods ( +7 to hit). On a hit, a pseudopod deals 21 (6d6) acid damage, or 42 (12d6) acid damage while the ooze is enlarged.
- The ooze has the Enlarge and Invisibility traits below.

Enlarge (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). For 1 minute, the ooze magically increases in size. While enlarged, the ooze is Gargantuan, doubles its damage dice with its pseudopod attack, and makes Strength checks and Strength saving throws with advantage.

Invisibility (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). The ooze magically turns invisible for up to 1 hour until it attacks, it uses its Enlarge, or its concentration is broken (as if concentrating on a spell).

## Intelligent Black Puddings

The characters encounter two Ghaunadaur-worshiping drow who were transformed by Halaster's magic into black puddings, with these changes:

- The black puddings understand Elvish and Undercommon, but can't speak.
- Each pudding has an Intelligence of 14 and the following Innate Spellcasting trait:
Innate Spellcasting. The pudding's spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 12, +4 to hit with spell attacks). It can cast the following spells, requiring no components:
At will: dancing lights, mage hand
3/day each: darkness, faerie fire, shield
1/day: Melf's acid arrow


## Space Orogs

The characters encounter $1 \mathrm{~d} 4+1$ orogs hunting for easy prey. These orogs were raised in deep caverns on H'catha, a wheel-shaped planet ruled by beholders and the farthest world from Toril's sun. The orogs wear bucket helms resembling bulbous mind flayer heads, with large, glass-covered eye holes and tentacle-like breathing tubes.
In addition to its armor and weapons, each orog carries a tangler grenade. The orogs use these grenades to restrain foes before charging into melee.
Tangler Grenades. A tangler grenade is an alchemical, nonmagical item with an ovoid resin shell that shatters on impact. An as action, a creature can throw a tangler grenade at a point up to 60 feet away. Each creature within 10 feet of a shattered tangler grenade

## Elemental Ooze

The orb in area 4 weeps a steady stream of ooze channeled from the Swamp of Oblivion, the border realm between the Elemental Planes of Earth and Water. This ooze is a thick, viscid brown effluvium with streaks of orange, green, yellow, and black. It smells like rotten eggs and sticks to anything it touches. The ooze is never more than 5 feet deep in any given location and is difficult terrain. It moves slowly in the direction indicated by the wavy arrows on map 19 and also behaves like it's alive, occasionally extruding harmless pseudopods or amorphous shapes that bear passing resemblances to familiar creatures.
must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be restrained by sticky white webs. As an action, a creature can try to free itself or another creature within its reach from the webs, doing so with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check. A gallon of alcohol dissolves the webs produced by a single tangler grenade. Otherwise, the webs dissolve on their own after 1 hour, freeing any creatures restrained by them.

## Exploring This Level

The following encounters are keyed to map 19. Many of the caverns and tunnels are natural formations, while purple worms dug others long ago. The ooze that flows through much of the level smells foul but is harmless (see the "Elemental Ooze" sidebar).

## 1. The Resplendent Grotto of ICHthyGlug the Voluminous

Halaster has used his magic to tailor these caves to the satisfaction of Ichthyglug the marid.

## 1a. Shipwreck

This 50 -foot-high cavern contains the wreck of a cog (a 54 -foot-long cargo vessel with a single mast). The wreck's features are as follows:
Hull. The ship has broken in half, the shattered bow aiming northward and the aft section leaning against the east wall. The oak hull is soft and waterlogged, as though the vessel has been underwater for years, and both halves are encrusted with barnacles.
Mast and Anchor. The mast and anchor have broken off and lie in the middle of the cave, with the mast pointing toward a shimmering curtain of water to the west.
No Sails, No Rigging, No Crew. The ship's square sail, rigging, and crew are all missing. (The sail and the rigging disintegrated long ago.)
Characters who search the wreck discover its name carved over the barnacle-encrusted rudder: the Blue Opal. A character who learns the ship's name and succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence (History) check recalls that the Blue Opal sank in Waterdeep's harbor a few years ago under mysterious circumstances, and that the crew was rescued by merfolk who live in the harbor. Armed with this knowledge, a character can examine the hull for signs of foul play and, with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check, discover a square, smooth-cut hole in the aft section below what would have been the water line. A successful DC 16

Map 19: Caverns of Ooze

---

Intelligence (Arcana) check confirms that a disintegrate spell made the square hole, but there's no way to know who cast the spell or why the ship was sunk.

If more than one character enters the aft section at the same time, the partial hull shifts under the added weight, topples to one side, and collapses in on itself with a thunderous racket. Any creature inside the aft section when it collapses must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage from falling debris on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The watery curtains in area 1 b prevent the sound of the collapse from reaching area 1c.

## 1b. Curtains of Water

This passage has a 20 -foot-high, arched ceiling and contains three 1 -foot-thick, magic curtains of translucent, shimmering green seawater. Each watery curtain stretches from floor to ceiling and wall to wall. Sound passing through a curtain is greatly reduced; only creatures within 5 feet of it can hear anything from the other side.

Any object thrown or shot through a watery curtain has a cost of 60 feet immediately applied to its distance traveled. If this added distance changes a ranged weapon attack from normal to long range, the attack roll is made with disadvantage. An object that enters the curtain and can travel no farther falls to the floor inside the curtain.

Spell effects that would not reasonably pass through the watery curtain are stopped by the barrier as though it were a solid wall. For example, a magic missile spell could pass through the curtain to hit creatures on the far side of it, but the explosion from a fireball spell would not get through the barrier.

A creature that passes through a watery curtain gets drenched but suffers no other ill effects. In addition, lit torches and other open flames of a nonmagical nature are doused as they pass through the water. Any creature that takes damage from water, such as a fire elemental, takes 11 (2d10) cold damage when it starts its turn in a watery curtain or enters it for the first time on a turn.

If a watery curtain takes 50 cold damage or more from a single source, it becomes a 1 -foot-thick wall of ice (as if created by a wall of ice spell) for 10 minutes before reverting to its original form. A watery curtain targeted by a successful dispel magic spell (DC 17) is destroyed for good.

## 1c. Ichthyglug's Cavern

Music. Magical harp music fills this 30 -foot-high cavern. Pool. A 15 -foot-deep freshwater pool is home to a marid and six swarms of quippers.
Walls. The damp walls have harmless snails and giant starfish clinging to them.
The marid, Ichthyglug, is swimming in his pool when the characters first arrive. He greets them with a song (see the "Ichthyglug's Song" sidebar). As he sings, Ichthyglug uses his magic to cause fountains of water to erupt from the pool as quippers leap out of the water around him. Ichthyglug is neither good nor evil, but always unpredictable. His attitude toward the characters reflects their attitude toward him.

After concluding his song, Ichthyglug floats up to characters who seem receptive and gives them the opportunity to flatter his singing. After these pleasantries, he offers the characters a quest: destroy the lich Ezzat on level 20 and give the lich's phylactery to Ichthyglug. The marid promises fabulous treasure in exchange, even going so far as to mention that he is forced by Halaster's magic to make good on this promise (see "Treasure" below).

If the characters complete Ichthyglug's quest and give Ezzat's phylactery to the marid, the pool in this cavern turns into a vortex that draws Ichthyglug, the water, the quippers, and the lich's phylactery back to the Elemental Plane of Water. The characters find Ichthyglug's promised reward at the bottom of the drained pool. Characters who complete Ichthyglug's quest should receive XP as if they had defeated the marid and the swarms of quippers in combat.

If the characters destroy Ezzat but give the lich's phylactery to Jarûk the dao in area 11b, Ichthyglug knows this. Furious, he attacks the characters the next time he sees them.

Ichthyglug can't leave his cave without Ezzat's phylactery. If the marid dies here, his body disintegrates into a burst of water and foam, only to re-form 24 hours later. (The characters don't receive XP for killing Ichthyglug more than once.)

The marid commands the quippers to attack anyone who dares to enter his pool. The swarms pose no danger to creatures on land.

Treasure. Ichthyglug wears a pair of golden bracers shaped like octopi ( 250 gp each) and a large silk vest studded with ten blue spinels ( 500 gp each). These baubles vanish with the marid when he returns to the Elemental Plane of Water.

Ichthyglug's reward consists of a suit of mariner's armor (scale mail) and two common wondrous items: a candle of the deep and a pole of angling (both described below). These items appear only after the characters complete Ichthyglug's quest and help the marid escape from Undermountain.

The flame of the candle of the deep is not extinguished when immersed in water. It gives off light and heat like a normal candle.

## Ichthyglug's Song

Welcome to my grotto! Call me king of the cray. Ichthyglug's my nameI'm the catch of the day.
The ocean's my oyster.
The waves are mine to rule. Ichthyglug's my nameBaddest fish in the school.
I'm current. I'm the tide. I'll rain on your parade. Ichthyglug's my nameI'm the siren's serenade.
I'll drown you in riches. I might go overboard. Ichthyglug's my nameBut please call me "my lord."

---

The pole of angling looks like a 10 -foot pole. While holding the pole, one can speak the command word ("Ichthyglug") and transform it into a fishing pole with a hook, a line, and a reel. Speaking the command word again changes the fishing pole back into a normal 10 -foot pole.

## 2. Space Orogs

Eyes. The 15 -foot-high ceiling of this passage is carved with hundreds of glaring eyes. (Halaster used magic to create the eyes, which are harmless.)
Orogs. Twelve hostile orogs (see "Space Orogs," page 244) are camped here. Subtract from this number any orogs previously encountered and defeated as wandering monsters.
One of the orogs has 60 hit points and is bigger than the others. Her name is Rukha, and until recently she served as first mate aboard the Scavenger (see area 13).

## Treasure

Rukha the orog has a sending stone tucked in one of her gauntlets. Rukha's mate, the former cook of the Scavenger, had the matching stone but lost it (see area 13c).

## 3. Ooze There?

The characters see odd shapes form out of the ooze that flows nearby.

## 3a. The Great Ooze March

The river of ooze flows north through this 15 -foot-high cave (see "Elemental Ooze," page 244). When the characters first arrive, the ooze rises and takes the form of a conga line of modrons stretching as far as the characters can see. The modrons march against the sluggish flow and make little progress. After 1 minute, they sink back into the ooze. The ooze modrons aren't creatures or spell effects, and they can't be harmed or dispelled.

## 3b. Ooze Halaster

An artery of ooze flows down this tunnel and pools in a slight depression in the rocky floor. The first time anyone comes within 10 feet of the pool, the ooze rises up, takes the form of Halaster Blackcloak, and flails its arms in a way that suggests it might be trying to cast a spell. After 1 minute, the effigy of Halaster loses its form and becomes a pool of ooze once more. The ooze isn't a creature and can't be harmed, nor is it a magical effect that can be dispelled.

## 4. The Weeping Eye

Ooze. This 60 -foot-high cavern contains a large pool of viscid, foul-smelling ooze that flows sluggishly northwest.
Urm. A mud mephit named Urm crouches near the edge of the ooze (at the spot marked M on map 19), absently poking it with a short pole while mumbling to itself.
Orb. Near the east wall, a 10 -foot-diameter orb of ooze floats 5 feet above the pool. The orb weeps a continuous stream of ooze into the pool and appears to be its source (see "Orb of Ooze" below).

Rock Formations. The cavern's ceiling is dotted with stalactites, and the ooze flows around a few stalagmites that rise from the rocky floor.
Urm had the misfortune of being caught up in the ooze being siphoned from the Swamp of Oblivion and deposited here. Halaster found the mud mephit and cast a geas spell on it, compelling it to serve Jarûk the dao and Ichthyglug the marid. The genies use Urm as an intermediary to communicate insults to one another, but the mephit has grown weary of the genies' game. It wants to be free of Halaster's geas spell.
Urm knows all about the competition between Jarûk and Ichthyglug, and tries to lead adventurers to both genies, one after the other. Urm offers to take characters to see Ichthyglug first (area 1), since the marid is closer. If the characters have already spoken with Ichthyglug, Urm offers to guide them to Jarûk's caverns (area 11) by following the river of ooze.
Urm is lazy and selfish, inclined not to help characters beyond what it must do to satisfy the terms of its geas spell. It is familiar with the dangers lurking in the Caverns of Ooze but denies knowing anything. Removing Halaster's geas spell makes the mephit somewhat more helpful but doesn't change its wicked disposition. In exchange for its newfound freedom, Urm shares the following information, which is a mixture of truth and lies:

- The ooze that spills from the orb and fills these caverns comes from a place called the Swamp of Oblivion (true).
- Halaster captured a strange-looking vessel and hid it in a giant cavern nearby (true). The ship is alive (false).
- A powerful demon is trapped in a statue to the north (false).


## Orb of Ooze

The orb is immobile, though it can be moved with a telekinesis spell or similar magic. Casting a disintegrate spell on the orb destroys it and stops the flow of ooze into the cavern. Other spells have no effect on the orb.
Creatures and objects can pass through the orb, which is made of the same ooze found throughout this level of the dungeon. Any creature that enters the orb is restrained by it. A creature restrained by the orb can use an action to make a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check, freeing itself on a success. Another creature outside the orb can use an action to attempt the check if its within reach of the restrained creature; on a successful check, the creature is freed from the orb.

## 5. In the Grip of Ghaunadaur

A 15 -foot-high tunnel containing an open pit connects two caves with 20 -foot-high ceilings.

## 5a. Pudding Pit

This naturally formed pit is 20 feet across and 20 feet deep. At the bottom of the pit are three intelligent black puddings (see "Intelligent Black Puddings," page 244) that used to be drow worshipers of Ghaunadaur. When they detect prey nearby, the puddings climb the sides of the pit and use faerie fire spells to outline their intended

---

targets before attacking with their pseudopods. The puddings cast Melf's acid arrow spells at prey beyond their reach.

## 5b. Standing Gate to Level 12

At the north end of this 20 -foot-high cave are two 15 -foot-tall standing stones hewn from black basalt. Carved into the lintel spanning them is a large, bloodred X. The standing stones form one of Halaster's magic gates (see "Gates," page 12).
When a creature comes within 5 feet of the gate, rivulets of blood begin to seep from the rocky pores of the standing stones. The rules of this gate are as follows:

- The gate opens for 1 minute if a creature marked with a bloody $X$ stands within 5 feet of it.
- Characters must be 12th level or higher to pass through this gate (see "Jhesiyra Kestellharp," page 10). The first creature to pass through the gate triggers an elder rune (see "Elder Runes," page 12).
- A creature that passes through the gate appears in area 8 b on level 12 , in the closest unoccupied space next to the identical gate located there.


## 6. Cave with a View

Stalactites. A few stalactites cling to this cavern's 30foot high, domed ceiling.
Vessel. An enormous vessel is clearly visible through openings in the northwest wall (see area 13).

## 7. Standing Gate to Level 21

Rubble. The floor of this 20 -foot-high cave is strewn with stony rubble that acts as difficult terrain.
Fake Beholder. A gas spore, easily mistaken for a beholder, floats near a pair of 15 -foot-tall menhirs made of semitransparent crystal. Imprisoned inside each menhir is a sleeping nalfeshnee, its leathery wings wrapped tightly around its head and body.
The gas spore drifted into this cave from area 8. Its spores contain memory fragments of the dead beholder that birthed it. A creature that inhales the spores inherits a random memory, determined by rolling on the Beholder Memories table. These memories are experienced from the eye tyrant's point of view.

## BeHolder Memories

d100 Memory
01-20 The beholder chases a deep gnome through a fungal forest in a vast Underdark cavern illuminated by glowing mushrooms and phosphorescent fungi.
21-40 The beholder encounters another of its kind in the Underdark and, after a fierce volley of eye rays, it turns its rival to dust with a Disintegration Ray.
41-60 The beholder examines a tower-sized stalagmite with a large crystal atop it (see level 20, area 14).
61-80 The beholder is swallowed by a purple worm and uses its Charm Ray to make the worm release it.
81-00 The beholder falls into a sinkhole as it succumbs to Halaster's finger of death spell (see area 8).

## NALFESHNEES

The sleeping demons can't be targeted by spells or attacks while trapped inside the crystal menhirs. They remain asleep until awakened (see "Standing Gate" below). An awakened nalfeshnee teleports out of its menhir and attacks, then returns to slumber in its menhir when there are no more enemies in sight.

## Standing Gate

The crystal menhirs are indestructible and form one of Halaster's magic gates (see "Gates," page 12). Striking either menhir with a hard object or targeting it with a shatter spell deals no damage but causes the standing stone to ring loudly, awakening the demon inside. Nothing else causes these demons to awaken. While outside its menhir, a nalfeshnee can be magically compelled to divulge the command word that activates the gate. A legend lore spell or similar magic also reveals the command word. The current word is "Kelserath," but Halaster changes it every few days.
The rules of this gate are as follows:

- The gate opens for 1 minute if a creature speaks the proper command word within 10 feet of it.
- Characters must be 16th level or higher to pass through this gate (see "Jhesiyra Kestellharp," page 10). The first creature to pass through the gate triggers an elder rune (see "Elder Runes," page 12).
- A creature that passes through the gate appears in area 23 b on level 21 , in the closest unoccupied space next to the identical gate located there.


## 8. Thanks for the Memories

Ceiling. This cavern has a 30 -foot-high ceiling.
Gas Spores. Three gas spores float above a large sinkhole surrounded by rubble. Another ten gas spores float inside the sinkhole, which plunges 100 feet into darkness. (At the bottom of the sinkhole lies a moldering beholder corpse.)
Elevated Tunnel. A 10 -foot-diameter tunnel in the west wall can be reached by climbing a 10 -foot-high ledge. (This ledge is further described in area 9.)
Halaster killed a beholder that sought to carve out a domain on this level. From its moldering corpse grew a host of gas spores. Inspection of the remains accompanied by a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Medicine) check reveals that the beholder died from fire, force, and necrotic damage. Inspection also reveals a treasure (see "Treasure" below).
The gas spores carry the memories of the beholder that birthed them. A creature that inhales the spores inherits a random beholder memory, determined by rolling on the Beholder Memories table. These memories are experienced from the eye tyrant's point of view.
The walls of the sinkhole have abundant handholds and can be scaled with a successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check.

## Treasure

The dead beholder has a gold tongue stud set with a peridot ( 750 gp ).

---

## 9. High Ground

This 30 -foot-high cavern contains two 10 -foot ledges-a smaller one to the west and a bigger one to the south. Five gargoyles perch on the north ledge. When the gargoyles detect intruders, one of them flies north to warn the dao (in area 11) that visitors have arrived. If this gargoyle is wounded or waylaid, all the gargoyles attack. Otherwise, the gargoyles that remain speak to visitors in Terran, welcoming them to the "magnificent subterranean domain of Jarûk the dao." They hurl mean insults at the characters if they don't seem to comprehend what the gargoyles are saying.

## Treasure

A gargoyle that dies but isn't disintegrated outright falls to stony pieces, revealing a fist-sized, transparent red garnet ( 500 gp ) where its heart used to be.

## 10. Culvert

The normally sluggish river of ooze flows a bit faster as it approaches a natural, 10 -foot-diameter culvert in the north wall. Any creature in the ooze that ends its turn in the culvert must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be irresistibly pulled under. Unless the creature is tethered to something, it drowns in ooze as it is borne deep into the Underdark.

## 11. The Glittering Caverns of Jarûk the Prismatic

These crystal-lined caves are home to a dao and its minions.

## 11a. Fortune Favors the Boulders

Columns and Crystals. Two columns of rock support the 30 -foot-high ceiling of this cave, the walls of which are encrusted with crystals that catch and reflect light.
Boulders. The floor is strewn with boulders and rubble. Six galeb duhr beholden to Jarûk hide here, disguised as boulders.
Music. Dissonant music emanates from a smaller cave to the southeast (area 11b).
If the characters attack Jarûk in area 11b, the galeb duhr attack the characters when they return to this cave. Otherwise, the creatures remain motionless and pose no danger. If provoked into attacking, the galeb duhr animate boulders. The galeb duhr and their boulders can pursue prey beyond the confines of this cavern.

## 11b. Jarûk's Cavern

Music. Rock music fills this 30 -foot-high cavern, which resembles the inside of a geode. The walls and ceiling are encrusted with crystals that catch and reflect light.
Dao in the Sand. The floor is concave and filled with golden sand to a depth of 10 feet. A dao hides in the sand until visitors appear.
Medusas. Two medusas wearing black robes and veils lurk in the northern alcove.
The dao, Jarûk, rises out of the sand when the characters first arrive. He greets them with a song (see the "Jarûk's Song" sidebar). As he sings, the veiled medusas
emerge from their alcove and begin to dance around him as the sand swirls and forms little dust devils. Jarûk is evil and cruel, but his current predicament motivates him to be a civil host.
Once his song has ended, Jarûk offers the characters a quest: destroy the lich Ezzat on level 20 and bring him the lich's phylactery. The dao promises treasure in exchange and is forced by Halaster's magic to make good on this promise (see "Treasure" below). If the characters complete Jarûk's quest and give Ezzat's phylactery to the dao, the sandy floor turns into a giant vortex that draws Jarûk, the medusas, the sand, and the lich's phylactery back to the Elemental Plane of Earth. The characters find Jarûk's promised reward on the floor of the emptied cave. Characters who complete Jarûk's quest should receive XP as if they had defeated the dao and the medusas in combat.
If the characters destroy Ezzat but give the lich's phylactery to Ichthyglug the marid in area 1c, Jarûk knows this and attacks the characters the next time he sees them.
Jarûk can't leave his cave without Ezzat's phylactery. If the dao dies here, his body disintegrates into crystalline powder, only to re-form 24 hours later. (The characters don't receive XP for killing Jarûk more than once.)
The medusas defend the dao to the best of their ability. Jarûk is immune to their Petrifying Gaze.
Treasure. Jarûk wears a pair of golden hoop earrings studded with obsidian ( 500 gp for the pair) and an amber diadem ( $7,500 \mathrm{gp}$ ). These baubles vanish with the dao when he returns to the Elemental Plane of Earth.
Jarûk's reward consists of a gem of brightness and two common wondrous items: boots of false tracks and an orb of direction (both described below). These items appear only after the characters complete Jarûk's quest and help him escape from Undermountain.
The wearer of boots of false tracks can choose to have the boots leave tracks like those of another kind of humanoid of the wearer's size. Only humanoids can wear these boots.
Someone who holds an orb of direction can use an action to determine which way is north. This property functions only on the Material Plane.

## JARÛK'S SONG

Welcome to my cavern! I'm master of this hole. Jarûk is who I amThe khan of rock and roll.
I'm the sand in your shoes. I'm the soil in your graves. Jarûk is who I amThe diamond in these caves.
I leave no stone unturned. My wealth's beyond belief. Jarûk is who I amA god in bas-relief!
Gold runs through my veins. It seeps through all my pores. Jarûk is who I amThe pleasure is all yours.

## 12. Ghaunadaur Shrine

Intelligent Oozes. Clinging to the 20 -foot-high ceiling are three intelligent black puddings that were once drow worshipers of Ghaunadaur (see "Intelligent Black Puddings," page 244). These oozes are hostile toward all intruders. (A battle here also attracts the Huge gray ooze in area 14.)
Shrine. Nestled in a 12 -foot-high alcove at the back of the cave is a misshapen granite altar. Staring out from it is a 1 -foot-diameter purple disk inscribed with a black, glaring eye. Looming behind the altar is a 9 -foot-tall statue carved in the form of an amorphous, forward-lurching pillar that reaches out with a dozen clawed human arms.
The disk embedded in the altar can be removed by turning it 360 degrees counterclockwise. Removing the disk causes copper coins to spill out from a hollow cavity inside the altar (see "Treasure" below).
If the altar is opened, the multiarmed representation of Ghaunadaur animates and attacks creatures within 10 feet of it or within 5 feet of the altar. The statue is a Large object with AC 17, 50 hit points, a speed of 0 feet, and immunity to acid, poison, and psychic damage. It has the following ability scores: Strength 14, Dexterity 10, Intelligence 3, Wisdom 3, and Charisma 1. It has blindsight out to a range of 10 feet and is blind beyond this radius.
As an action, the animated statue makes a single melee weapon attack ( +10 to hit) with its claws. On a hit, the claws deal $22(5 \mathrm{~d} 6+5)$ slashing damage to the target, and any nonmagical armor worn by the target is destroyed.

## Treasure

The altar's hidden cavity contains $2,000 \mathrm{cp}$.

## 13. The Scavenger

The Scavenger is a 290 -foot-long, 50 -foot-wide, 25 -ton spelljamming vessel-a ship designed to travel through space. Halaster detected the vessel as it orbited Toril and lured it through a magic gate into Undermountain. He then boarded the vessel, stole its spelljamming helm (the magic device that propels and steers the craft), and took the helm to level 23, leaving the captain and crew to fend for themselves.
Mind flayers constructed the Scavenger to resemble a giant cuttlefish. Its hull is made of an alien resin as hard as thick wood. Behind the ship's tentacle-shaped rams are two circular windows of transparent crystal resembling eyes, and an upper deck (area 13a) equipped with four ballistae manned by gray slaadi. An open hatch on the upper deck provides access to the lower deck (areas 13b through 13h). The ceilings on the lower deck are 10 feet high.
The ship sits in a 5 -foot-deep pool of ooze in an immense cavern, the ceiling of which varies from 30 to 50 feet high. A character can climb the ship's hull with a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check; the distance from the cavern floor to the upper deck is roughly 20 feet.

## Captain N'ghathrod

The captain of the Scavenger is an illithid pirate named N'ghathrod. N'ghathrod is a mind flayer arcanist (see the sidebar in the "Mind Flayer" entry in the Monster Manual) with 111 hit points. It uses a crystal orb as an arcane focus and dresses in pirate garb. A wooden peg replaces one of its feet, which it lost in battle years ago. Tucked in the pockets of its overcoat are four fist-sized gray gem-stones-the control gems for the gray slaadi that guard the ship's upper deck. N'ghathrod carries a rapier as an affectation but it not proficient with the weapon.
Before it turned to a life of space piracy, N'ghathrod lived in a mind flayer colony on the ringed planet of Glyth, which is farther from the sun than Toril. A few weeks after the Scavenger became trapped in Undermountain, N'ghathrod turned on its orog crew out of hunger, killing four of them and eating their brains. The remaining orog crew members fled to avoid a similar fate. The arrival of adventurers provides N'ghathrod with an unexpected but welcome food source. It tries to separate one party member from the others with a wall of force spell. It then uses its Mind Blast to stun its prey as a prelude to extracting its brain.
If N'ghathrod is reduced to 55 hit points or fewer, its survival instinct supersedes its hunger, prompting it to surrender telepathically. The mind flayer apologizes for its assault and proposes an end to hostilities. Given a chance, it recounts how the Scavenger was orbiting Toril when it was pulled through a magic gate to its current location. It also reveals that the ship's spelljamming helm vanished shortly thereafter (spirited away by a wish spell, though the mind flayer doesn't know it). If the mind flayer and the characters establish a truce, N'ghathrod offers to "guard the ship" while the characters set out to retrieve the stolen helm. If the characters succeed, N'ghathrod allows them to claim the vessel as their own, accepting a demotion until it finds a way to get rid of them.
Lair Actions. When fighting aboard the Scavenger, N'ghathrod can take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), N'ghathrod can take one lair action to cause one of the following effects:

- N'ghathrod creates a magical duplicate of itself anywhere aboard the ship. Formed out of psionic energy, this duplicate lasts until it is reduced to 0 hit points, until it is dispelled (DC 15), or until N'ghathrod takes another lair action. The duplicate has the statistics of a normal mind flayer and is friendly toward N'ghathrod, but not under its control. It cannot leave the Scavenger.
- N'ghathrod fills all interior areas of the ship with mind-warping images and sounds of the Far Realm that last until initiative count 20 on the next round. Any creature that isn't an aberration that starts its turn inside the ship must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 10 (3d6) psychic damage.

The Scavenger is buoyant but has no sails, oars, or other means of propulsion without its spelljamming helm. The vessel can hold up to 10 tons of cargo, and its standard crew complement is twenty. It has AC 15, 400 hit points, a damage threshold of 20 , and immunity to poison and psychic damage.
Only a carefully worded wish spell can free the Scavenger from the cavernous depths of Undermountain. Characters who free the ship from its confines can sell it for $20,000 \mathrm{gp}$, minus 50 gp for each point of damage the ship has taken.

---

## 13a. Upper Deck

Ballistae. Three ballistae are mounted on the forward deck, and a fourth on the aft deck. Four gray slaadi shapechanged into orogs operate the ballistae, one per weapon.
Hatch. Not visible from the floor of the cavern is an open hatch with a ladder that descends to area 13b.
A ballista is a Large object with AC 15, 50 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Before it can be fired, a ballista must be loaded and aimed. (The ballistae are loaded when the characters first arrive.) It takes one action to load the weapon, one action to aim it, and one action to fire it ( +6 to hit, range 120/480 ft., one target). On a hit, a ballista bolt deals 16 (3d10) piercing damage.
Each ballista comes with ten bolts stored in a rack built into the weapon's stand. A swivel base gives each ballista a firing arc of 180 degrees.
The slaadi have been trained to load, aim, and fire the ballistae. They defend the deck against all boarders, relying on their darkvision to keep watch.

## 13b. Cargo Hold

Ladder. A ladder bolted to a wall climbs to the upper deck (area 13a). Hanging upside down on the ladder is a dead orog in plate armor.
Crates. A second dead orog in plate armor, along with its greataxe, lies amid the wreckage of several wooden crates. Toward the back of the hold are five intact wooden crates and five wooden chests secured under heavy cargo nets.
Dead Cook. The hallway leading toward the lower deck's forward sections contains a third dead orog, this one wearing a bloodstained apron and no armor.
The dead orog on the ladder hangs by one of its spiked boots. A character can use an action to dislodge the dangling fellow. Examination of all three orogs reveals that their skulls were cracked open and their brains sucked out-the hallmark of a mind flayer attack. The orog in the apron lies outside the door to area 13c.
Treasure. The crew plundered most of the food supplies before fleeing the ship, leaving behind five treasure chests and five intact crates (numbered below for ease of bookkeeping). The chests are unlocked, their locks broken off.
Chest 1 contains $400 \mathrm{sp}, 180 \mathrm{gp}$, and three gold bracelets ( 25 gp each). Half buried by coins is a 5 -inch-diameter miniature beholder made of enameled gold with a black pearl central eye and multicolored spinels at the ends of its eyestalks ( $2,500 \mathrm{gp}$ ).
Chest 2 contains six bolts of elven silk ( 50 gp each) and an engraved box containing five 3 -inch-tall figu-rines-each one depicting a kind of metallic dragon and made of the appropriate metal ( 250 gp for the set).
Chest 3 contains six vials of stardust that radiate an aura of illusion magic under the scrutiny of a detect magic spell. An identify spell or similar magic reveals that the dust has a singular magical property. Any creature that sprinkles the dust over itself gains the ability to cast the dream spell once as an action (spell save DC 15), requiring no components.

Chest 4 contains 320 gp and a silk pouch holding four blue pellets, each of which reproduces the magical property of a potion of healing when swallowed.
Chest 5 contains a matching set of five copper goblets with silver filigree ( 25 gp each), a black coral necklace ( 250 gp ), and a mummified elven hand wearing two gem-studded gold rings ( 250 gp each).
Crates 1 through 3 contain poisoned rations. A character who inspects these rations and succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check can tell that they're unfit to eat. Any creature that ingests a helping of poisoned rations must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 24 hours.
Crate 4 contains 60 days of edible dry rations.
Crate 5 is stamped with the symbol of a smiling gnome face encircled with the words "KRICKENHOF'S KRAFTWERKS" in carnival letters. Packed in peanuts are three gnome inventions: a spring-loaded pogo stick ( 25 gp ), a wind-up tomato masher ( 125 gp ), and a strap-on helmet with a wooden propeller mounted to the top of it. This propeller helm is an uncommon wondrous item to which only a Small humanoid can attune. While worn, the helm allows its wearer to use an action to cast the levitate spell, requiring no components. The helm's propeller spins and whirs loudly until the spell ends. Each time the spell ends, there is a 50 percent chance that the helm loses its magic and becomes nonmagical.

## 13c. Galley and Mess Hall

This room contains a dining table, six stools, and a small iron stove. Cupboards built into the walls have been thrown open, their contents (utensils and dishware) scattered across the floor.
Casting a detect magic spell in this cabin reveals an aura of evocation magic emanating from inside the wall that separates this room from area 13d.
Treasure. Characters who search the cabin and succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) spot a tiny hole at the base of the wall that separates this cabin from area 13d. Two feet above this hole, lodged inside the wall, is a sending stone. (The matching stone can be found with the orog first mate in area 2.)
If a character removes the sending stone from the wall, a miniature giant space hamster scuttles out of the hole in the base of the wall and looks rather put out. The space hamster looks remarkably like a normal hamster. It has the statistics of a rat but no attacks (and is worth 0 XP ). It has made a nice lair for itself in the walls of the ship but poses no danger if it's disturbed. A character can befriend the hamster by offering it food.

## 13D. Captain's Stateroom

Walls. The resin walls are sculpted and painted to look like glossy black tentacles entwined around one another and the screaming elves in their grasp.
Easel and Paintings. Resting on a wooden easel in the middle of the cabin is a half-finished canvas painting of a colorful alien landscape. Next to the easel, several paintbrushes and jars of paint lie on a small table. Five finished paintings of other alien landscapes are leaning against the back of the easel.

---

Chair. A bloodstained wooden chair with iron wristclamps bolted to its armrests sits in a forward alcove. A pool of sticky blood covers the floor around it.
Secret Compartment. A character who searches the cabin for secret doors and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check finds a small hatch built into the floorboards. This hatch conceals a shallow compartment containing Captain N'ghathrod's spellbook.
N'ghathrod straps captives to this chair before devouring their brains. A creature shackled to the chair can use an action to try to escape, doing so with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check.
Treasure. Before he was transformed into an illithid by the process known as ceremorphosis, Captain N'ghathrod was a spacefaring elf. Although it has no memories of its former life, the mind flayer retains its elven fondness for celestial beauty. The paintings, which illustrate worlds that N'ghathrod has visited, are worth 100 gp each.
N'ghathrod's spellbook is bound in leather, its contents written in a Braille-like script. The mind flayer uses its tentacles to read the script, which other creatures can decipher with a comprehend languages spell. The book contains all the spells N'ghathrod has prepared, plus animate dead, Bigby's hand, and Evard's black tentacles.

## 13e. Starboard Crew Cabin

This cabin contains two sets of bunks stacked three tiers high.

## 13f. Port Crew Quarters

This cabin is furnished like area 13 e and also contains a dead orog lying face down on the floor. Examination of the corpse reveals that the orog's skull was cracked open and its brain sucked out. Lying at the orog's feet is a greataxe.

## 13g. Bridge

The door to the bridge stands slightly ajar. N'ghathrod, ther mind flayer captain, is here (see the "Captain N'ghathrod" sidebar). The features of the bridge are as follows:
Windows. Two circular, 9 -foot-diameter windows of bulging, transparent crystal rest in bronze fixtures.
Celestial Chart. Painted on the sloped ceiling are familiar constellations and unfamiliar planets.
Grooves. Grooves in the middle of the floor suggest that a piece of furniture once rested there.
Characters who examine the grooves and succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check can ascertain that they're designed to secure a heavy chair or chair-shaped object to the floor. The grooves conform to the footprint of the ship's spelljamming helm, which can be found on level 23.
The chart on the ceiling has the sun at its center, with elongated rings showing the paths of the eight planets that orbit it: rocky Anadia; Coliar the gas giant; Toril and the small asteroid cluster orbiting it called the Tears of Selûne; the water worlds Karpri and Chandos; the noxious ringed planet Glyth; the asteroid cluster of Garden,
which is held together by an enormous plant; and the wheel-shaped H'catha. Beyond the planets are the constellations of Realmspace, all visible in the night skies of Toril at various times of the year.

## 13H. Oh Captain, My Captain!

The floor here is covered with shattered glass and brine, the remains of jars that once held pickled humanoid brains. The curved walls bear empty shelves where Captain N'ghathrod stored its emergency food reserves. The mind flayer was forced to eat the pickled brains after its crew fled and now hungers for fresh food.

## 14. Ooze Den

This 10 -foot-high cave has become the lair of a Huge gray ooze (see "Huge Gray Ooze," page 244), which lurks in the northernmost alcove to the right of the entrance. If the characters already fought this ooze in area 12 , the cave is empty.

## 15. Standing Gate to Level 17

Rising out of a 2 -foot-deep pool of ooze is a pair of 15 -foot-tall standing stones topped with a lintel, carved into which is a symbol of an arrow. The standing stones form a magic gate (see "Gates," page 12). Its rules are as follows:

- If an arrow or a crossbow bolt is shot between the standing stones, the gate opens for 1 minute.
- Characters must be 14th level or higher to pass through this gate (see "Jhesiyra Kestellharp," page 10). The first creature to pass through the gate triggers an elder rune (see "Elder Runes," page 12).
- A creature that passes through the gate appears in area 8 b on level 17 , in the closest unoccupied space next to the identical gate located there.


## 16. Tunnel to Level 20

At the top of the tunnel that descends to level 20 is an 18 -foot-high, ring-shaped cavern created by a purple worm that Halaster disposed of long ago.

## Aftermath

The characters have a couple of reasons to return to this level after exploring it:

- If they acquire the phylactery of the lich Ezzat, the characters must come back to the Caverns of Ooze with the phylactery to claim their prizes from the marid in area 1c or the dao in area 11b. Giving the phylactery to one genie makes an enemy of the other.
- If the characters recover the spelljamming helm that was stolen by Halaster, they can return it to the Scavenger and use a wish spell to expel the vessel from Undermountain.
The level changes little in the characters' absence, at least in the short term. If Ichthyglug or Jarûk is set free, Halaster might trap an efreeti on this level and pit it against whichever genie was denied Ezzat's phylactery, setting up the new arrival in a cave befitting its fiery nature.

![img-37.jpeg](assets/Waterdeep%20-%20Dungeon%20of%20the%20Mad%20Mage_img-37.jpeg)

UNESTONE CAVERNS IS DESIGNED FOR FOUR 16th-level characters, and characters who defeat the monsters on this level should gain enough XP to advance halfway to 17 th level. This level introduces the characters to a potentially powerful ally in their fight against Halaster-or an enemy whose destruction can put them in the Mad Mage's good graces.

## What Dwells Here?

The Runestone is a large magic crystal, created by Halaster Blackcloak, that is embedded in the top of a huge, hollowed-out stalagmite that rises from the center of this level's main cavern. This spire serves as the lair of a lich named Ezzat, who has long been Halaster's enemy.

In an effort to destroy Ezzat, Halaster created a legion of stone golems modeled after himself, placing a fragment of the Runestone in each one to imbue it with more intelligence and personality. When Ezzat learned what Halaster was up to, the lich placed wards on the stalagmite tower to prevent constructs from assailing it. This countermove prompted Halaster to abandon his golems and stop making new ones.

## Ezzat the Lich

Ezzat has become obsessed with destroying Halaster and usurping his control over Undermountain. As his mania and thirst for power grows, the lich becomes more like Halaster with each passing day.

Characters who destroy Ezzat and locate his phylactery earn Halaster's favor. Those who ally with the lich earn Halaster's enmity.

## Stonecloaks

Halaster created stone golems in his own likeness and used fragments of the Runestone to imbue them with intelligence. Then he set them loose on this level. Called Stonecloaks, these 10 -foot-tall golems worship the Mad Mage as a god and regard the Runestone as his eye into their dark domain. The Stonecloaks don't like it that a lich has taken refuge in the stalagmite tower, but Ezzat's wards mean that there's little they can do about it.

Unless otherwise noted, a Stonecloak uses the stone golem statistics, with these changes:

- A Stonecloak has Intelligence and Charisma scores of 9.
- It understands the following languages but can't speak: Abyssal, Celestial, Common, Draconic, Dwarvish, Elvish, Infernal, and Undercommon. Stonecloaks use a system of eye blinks to communicate nonverbally with one another.


## Wandering Monsters

The magical emanations of the Runestone attract earth-dwelling creatures such as bulettes, earth elementals, purple worms, and xorn to this level. The characters might also come across an expedition that has traveled from Shadowdusk Hold.

---

## ShADOWDUSK ExPEdition

An expeditionary force has been sent from Shadowdusk Hold (level 22) to collect Runestone fragments. The force consists of a chaotic evil human archmage named Akarrth Shadowdusk, a beholder named Gz'zarp, two grells, and two nothics. The grells and nothics are Akarrth's servants, the beholder his tenuous ally.
The characters can easily strike up an alliance with Akarrth, but any such pact is doomed to crumble in short order because the archmage is insane.
Treasure. Akarrth carries a wooden rod carved with tentacles that serves as an arcane focus ( 10 gp ), as well as a spellbook bound in mind flayer skin that contains all the spells he has prepared.

## Runestone CaverNS

All location descriptions for this level are keyed to map 20. The caverns and tunnels are uniformly damp from water that enters through narrow cracks in the walls and ceilings, and the sound of dripping water echoes throughout.

## 1. Desiccating Symbol

At the end of the tunnel that leads down from level 19, Ezzat has inscribed a glyph on the floor using a modified version of the symbol spell, requiring a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check to spot. Cast using a 9 th-level spell slot, the glyph triggers the death effect (save DC 20) when any creature crosses over it. After the effect is triggered, ghostly skulls float above the area where the glyph is inscribed.

## 2. Mad Golem's LaIR

Characters who approach this cavern from any direction hear stone smashing against stone. The cavern has a peaked roof 50 feet high and the following features:
Construct. A hulking, mobile mass of jumbled stone stands atop a natural rise in the center of the cavern. It is using its fists to smash something.
Forge. Carved into one wall is a stone forge that hasn't been lit in ages. A rusty iron anvil sits atop a 1 -foothigh granite plinth in front of the forge.
The jumbled construct was once a 10 -foot-tall stone golem created in the image of Halaster. In its madness, it has attached so many pieces of other Stonecloaks to itself that it has become a lumbering, 17 -foot-tall amalgamation of stone torsos, limbs, and heads--all of which resemble parts of the Mad Mage.
Any character who gets close can see that the object being destroyed by the mad golem is a stone golem that resembles Halaster. Even if the characters intervene quickly, the Stonecloak is already in pieces and can't be saved.
As the characters observe it for the first time, the mad golem removes the Runestone fragment from the pulverized remains of its latest victim and swallows it, then begins attaching pieces of the destroyed stone golem to itself. Swallowing the Runestone fragment allows the mad golem to ignore its Immutable Form trait and restores all its hit points. Characters who interrupt or
attack the golem incur its enmity. Otherwise, it shows little interest in them.
The mad golem is a stone golem with a challenge rating of $12(8,400 \mathrm{XP})$ and these changes:

- The golem is Huge and has $264(23 \mathrm{~d} 12+115)$ hit points.
- Each of its slam attacks deals $24(4 \mathrm{~d} 8+6)$ bludgeoning damage on a hit.
- It has Intelligence and Charisma scores of 9.
- It understands the following languages but can't speak: Abyssal, Celestial, Common, Draconic, Dwarvish, Elvish, Infernal, and Undercommon.
The golem is too big to fit down any tunnel smaller than 10 feet wide. Left to its own devices, it remains here and waits for another Stonecloak to wander into the area, then attacks it.


## Treasure

Any character who searches the interior of the forge and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check finds the soot-covered tinderbox, which contains a single bead of force.

## 3. Sunken Paradise

This cavern has a peaked roof 30 feet high and features a broad crevasse 300 feet deep. A rocky ledge surrounds the crevasse.
After descending 200 feet, the crevasse breaks through the roof of a vast cavern not shown on map 20. This otherworldly cavern is 100 feet high, 1,200 feet long, and 800 feet wide. It has the following features:
Light. The cavern is lit by phosphorescent moss that grows on weird rock formations along the walls. A dozen giant fire beetles that primarily feast on carrion dwell here, adding to the illumination.
Fungi Forest. Half the cavern is a forest of towering zurkhwood, interspersed with barrelstalks, bluecaps, and trillimacs (see "Fungi," page 59).
Lake. The other half of the cavern contains a 30 -footdeep lake fed by three small waterfalls. Several small rocky islands rise out of the lake, each holding a number of empty huts (an abandoned kuo-toa settlement).
The fungus forest and the underground lake are home to all kinds of subterranean wildlife, including bats, fish, and non-biting insects. For characters who reach it safely, the cavern provides a secure, idyllic refuge from the perils of Undermountain.

## 4. Myconid Colony

A myconid colony manages to thrive in this area, since the tunnels leading to these caves are too narrow for the Stonecloaks to squeeze through. The myconids must endure the occasional gargoyle attack, however.
The myconids provide strangers with food, water, shelter, and safe passage through their small domain.

## 4A. Melding Cave

Most of the myconids live in this cave, the ceiling of which is uneven and ranges in height from 15 to 30 feet. The cave's other features are as follows:

---

![img-38.jpeg](assets/Waterdeep%20-%20Dungeon%20of%20the%20Mad%20Mage_img-38.jpeg)

Map 20: Runestone Caverns

---

Moss. Thick moss grows on the walls and the ceiling. Fungi. The earthen floor gives rise to a forest of fungi, including barrelstalks, timmasks, tongues of madness, and trillimacs (see "Fungi," page 59).
Giant Insects. Six giant centipedes and four giant fire beetles are meandering among the fungi.
Myconids. The northern alcove is mostly clear of moss and fungi and filled with clouds of spores. Ten myconid sprouts and thirteen myconid adults gather here in silent meditation.
The centipedes and the fire beetles share this delicate ecosystem with the myconids, serving to help control the growth of fungi in the caverns. The light from the fire beetles' carapaces is the cave's only illumination. These creatures are not under the myconids' control and fight only in self-defense.
The myconid sprouts form an inner ring 6 feet in diameter, and the adults are in a protective ring 10 feet in diameter around them. The myconids use their Rapport Spores action option to peacefully meld with one another. Creatures that approach within 10 feet of the outer ring are subject to the spores' effect.
Characters who make telepathic contact with the myconids are greeted warmly. The myconids offer to take visitors to their sovereign (area 4b) or escort them to the edge of their domain. The friendly fungus folk are blissfully unaware of the conflict happening outside their caverns, but they're afraid of the "rock giants" (Halaster's stone golems) and "rock demons" (gargoyles) that dwell in the caves around them.

## 4b. Friendly Sovereign

Sloped Floor. The cave floor slopes upward, reducing its height from 15 feet near the entrance to 10 feet at its north end.
Fungi. Exotic mushrooms sprout from the earthen floor. The walls are lined with ripplebark (see "Fungi," page 59).
Sovereign. A 9-foot-tall myconid sovereign stands near the back of the cave. Its bioluminescent cap sheds bright light in a 10 -foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.
When not melding with its subjects, the myconid sov-ereign-named Floot-spends its time cultivating exotic mushrooms and crafting potions. Using its Rapport Spores action option to facilitate telepathic communication, Floot welcomes characters to its domain and offers them two potions as gifts (see "Treasure" below). Floot expects nothing in return, but if the characters are of a mind to reciprocate, the sovereign urges them to destroy any "rock demons" (gargoyles) they encounter, for the good of the myconid colony.
Treasure. Floot offers the characters a potion of mind reading and a potion of superior healing. Each potion is held in a clay gourd and hidden inside a hollowed-out trillimac (see "Fungi," page 59).

## 4c. QuAGGOTH SPORE SERVANTS

Guards. Five quaggoth spore servants gather here. Fungi. The walls are lined with ripplebark (see "Fungi," page 59).

The animating spores of the myconid sovereign have given the dead quaggoths a semblance of life. While in the presence of one or more myconids, the quaggoth spore servants regard all creatures with detached indifference and refrain from attacking. But they turn hostile if there are no myconids around to pacify them.

## 5. Giggling Chasm

A 20 -foot-wide, 70 -foot-deep crevasse has opened up in the floor of this 20 -foot-high cavern. The sound of an old man giggling rises from the depths of the crevasse every minute or so. This is a harmless illusion, one of Halaster Blackcloak's regional effects (see "Halaster's Lair," page 311).

## 6. LaIR OF THE MUMMY LORD

These caves form the lair of a duergar mummy lord named Gorka Tharn. Characters who cast spells in these areas or disturb the features of the caverns awaken the mummy lord, allowing the creature to bring its lair actions and regional effects into play (see the "Mummies" entry in the Monster Manual). In its lair, the mummy lord has a challenge rating of 16 (15,000 XP).

## 6A. ToOTHY MAW

This 20 -foot-high cavern resembles a tooth-filled maw because of its numerous stalactites and stalagmites. The plentiful rock formations make it difficult for large and cumbersome creatures to pass through the cavern, so the Stonecloaks avoid this area.
Casting a spell of 1st level or higher in this cavern has a chance of waking the mummy lord equal to the spell's level $\times 10$ percent. If the mummy lord awakens, the duergar mummies in area 6 b rise out of their mass grave and emerge from that area, moving to attack all creatures in the mummy lord's lair.

## 6b. Mass Grave

The floor of packed earth in this 10 -foot-high cave is a shallow grave for eight duergar mummies (Gorka Tharn's former disciples). The mummies burst out of the ground and attack any creatures that enter this area. If intruders flee, the mummies pursue. If the mummies awaken, so too does Gorka Tharn.

## 6c. MUMMY LORD'S CRYPT

Niches. Niches carved into the walls of this damp 20 -foot-high cavern contain hundreds of moldy skulls (a mix of dwarf and duergar). A few fallen skulls rest on the cavern floor.
Shrine. A small chamber to the east contains a chipped stone altar with treasure piled around it. The wall behind the altar is painted with a faded mural.
Alcove. An alcove to the northwest features a central stalagmite and stalactite, each 8 feet tall and covered with soot drawings of snakes and scorpions.
Stealing any of the treasure around the altar or touching the stalagmite automatically awakens Gorka Tharn. In addition, casting a spell of 1st level or higher in this cavern has a chance of waking the mummy lord equal to the spell's level $\times 10$ percent.

---

Gorka Tharn was a duergar priest of Laduguer, now transformed into a mummy lord, with these changes:

- The mummy lord speaks Dwarvish and Undercommon.
- It has the stone shape spell prepared instead of divination.
- It has the Enlarge and Invisibility action options described below.

Enlarge (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). For 1 minute, the mummy lord magically increases in size, along with anything it is wearing or carrying. While enlarged, the mummy lord is Large, doubles its damage dice with its Rotting Fist attack, and makes Strength checks and Strength saving throws with advantage. If the mummy lord lacks the room to become Large, it attains the maximum size possible in the space available.

Invisibility (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). The mummy lord magically turns invisible for up to 1 hour or until it attacks, it casts a spell, it uses its Enlarge, or its concentration is broken (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment the mummy lord wears or carries is invisible with it.

The stalagmite in the northwest alcove is hollow and serves as Gorka Tharn's sarcophagus. The mummy lord is lodged inside the stalagmite's funnel-shaped interior. When it awakens, the mummy lord uses a stone shape spell to create an opening large enough for it to emerge. It destroys any intruders in its lair, then returns to its sarcophagus and its slumber.
At the bottom of the stalagmite's hollow cavity, four 1-foot-tall clay urns contain Gorka Tharn's preserved internal organs, including the mummy lord's shriveled heart. Only by destroying the heart can the characters prevent the mummy lord from rejuvenating. The heart is a Tiny object with AC 5, 25 hit points, and immunity to all damage except fire.
Stone Altar and Treasure. The altar is carved from a single block of granite and dedicated to Laduguer, the evil god of the duergar. The mural painted on the wall behind the altar depicts a shadowy figure cradling a pile of gemstones in its arms. Any character who has an appropriate background or who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Religion) check confirms that the mural is meant to depict Laduguer.
Piled around the altar are $5,000 \mathrm{cp}, 2,300 \mathrm{sp}, 470 \mathrm{gp}$, five flawed diamonds ( 100 gp each), and an electrum teapot $(25 \mathrm{gp})$. A rusty warhammer is also found among the valuables. It disintegrates the first time it is used to strike anything hard.

## 7. Grypt Raiders

This 12 -foot-high cave contains six duergar, three males and three females, who have come up from level 21 to loot the shrine of Laduguer (area 6c). The male duergar are Klom Xornbane, Skrac Blackskull, and Anchok Muzgardt. The female duergar are Akith Xornbane (Klom's sister), Garlynth Ironhead, and Xarta Muzgardt (Anchok's sister). The duergar are hard to tell apart, since all of them wear mean-looking iron bucket helms with visors.

Having slipped past the Stonecloaks and the gargoyles in areas 8 and 9 , these duergar have just started a short rest to recharge their Invisibility when the characters happen upon them. The hateful, xenophobic duergar enlarge themselves and attack. They are too stubborn and determined to back down or surrender.

Each duergar carries a small gray sack holding 5 days of rations, and a large, empty gray sack to carry loot from the shrine.

A character who interrogates a duergar captive and succeeds on a DC 20 Charisma (Intimidation) check learns the following information:

- The duergar live in the Deep Mines (another name for the Terminus Level), the next level down from the Runestone Caverns.
- The Deep Mines are ruled by Fazrian, a "bald, greenskinned giant with glowing eyes and white-feathered wings." Any character who succeeds on a DC 18 Intelligence (Religion) check realizes, based on this description, that Fazrian is a planetar.
- The duergar have come to plunder a shrine of Laduguer on this level, then return to the Deep Mines with loot to earn Fazrian's favor. They know the shrine's location (area 6c) but nothing about the mummy lord that guards it.


## 8. Made of Stone

Gargoyles and stone golems watch over these caves, and Halaster has left a few other surprises here as well.

## 8a. Gargoyles and Golems

Ceiling. This cavern has walls that slope inward to form a 30 -foot-high peak.
Gargoyles. Six gargoyles cling to ledges 20 feet up the walls, three at the north end of the cavern and three at the south end.
Golems. Two stone golems carved to resemble Halaster (see "Stonecloaks," page 253) stand watch on the cavern floor. One is positioned near the tunnel to area 9a; the other is close to the tunnel to area 6a.
The gargoyles serve Halaster. They remain motionless unless they are attacked or combat erupts in this area, whereupon they fight as allies of the stone golems.
The golems are hostile toward any creature that doesn't look like Halaster or a gargoyle. A character disguised as Halaster can make a Charisma (Deception) check contested by the golems' Wisdom (Insight) check, with advantage on the check if the portrayal is particularly convincing. On a successful check, the golem won't attack that character unless the character attacks it.

## 8b. Natural Frieze

Rivulets of water trickling down the back wall of this damp 15 -foot-high cave have eroded the stone in a spectacular way, creating a natural frieze that resembles a hunched male human leaning down to pick up a staff while a great blue dragon sneaks up behind him. Halaster's contribution to the natural carving is the staff, which he formed out of the rock.

---

## 8c. Acid Tentacles

The gargoyles and golems in area 8a won't enter this empty cavern, the ceiling of which is a rough 15 -foothigh dome. A detect magic spell reveals an aura of conjuration magic throughout the cave-the effect of a magic trap placed here by Halaster.
When one or more creatures reach the cavern's midpoint, 15 -foot-long tentacles of acid magically erupt from the floor, walls, and ceiling. A creature that enters the tentacle-filled cavern for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw or take $10(3 \mathrm{~d} 6)$ acid damage and be grappled by a tentacle (escape DC 22). A creature that starts its turn grappled by a tentacle automatically takes 10 (3d6) acid damage.
The tentacles can't be damaged, and dispel magic has no effect on them. The tentacles disappear when all creatures have left the cavern. If the words "Halaster, save us!" are spoken aloud in the cavern in Common, the tentacles disappear, and the trap can't trigger again for 1 hour.

## 8b. Golden Haungharassk

Slime. A thin layer of slime covers the walls and floor of this 20 -foot-high cavern.
Fungus. A patch of glowing fungus sprouts from the east wall.
Giant Snail. In the northern part of the cave lurks
Haungharassk, a magical snail as large as an elephant, with a shell of gleaming gold.
Halaster placed Haungharassk here, setting up the trap in area 8 c both to confine the creature and to prevent others from killing it. The giant snail is an unaligned Huge beast with AC 6, $52(7 \mathrm{~d} 12+7)$ hit points, and walking and climbing speeds of 10 feet. It can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check. Its ability scores are as follows: Strength 20, Dexterity 3, Constitution 13, Intelligence 3, Wisdom 10, Charisma 3. It has no attacks and can't speak. A pound of salt thrown onto the snail's skin deals 1d6 acid damage to the creature.
The glowing golden hue of Haungharassk's shell is augmented by veins of real gold. That gold can be stripped from the shell, but only if the snail is dead (see "Treasure" below). Killing the snail yields no XP.
A detect magic spell reveals a powerful aura of abjuration magic around the snail. A creature that uses an action to touch the living snail gains 6 temporary hit points that last for 24 hours. Any creature or object that touches the living snail also gains the benefit of a remove curse spell. The snail loses these magical properties if it dies.
The characters can lead Haungharassk around by feeding it plants, fungi, or algae. A successful DC 10 Intelligence (Nature) check enables a character to discern what the giant snail likes to eat.
The patch of glowing fungus magically regrows each time it is picked. It is the snail's food source. The fungus dies if taken from this area.
Treasure. Characters who kill Haungharassk can strip 100 pounds of gold from the snail's shell with a few hours' work. The gold is worth $20,000 \mathrm{gp}$.

## 9. Way to the Gate

These out-of-the-way caverns hold one of Halaster's magic gates, the approach to which is closely watched by his servants.

## 9a. Stonecloak Sentries

Two stone golems carved to resemble Halaster (see "Stonecloaks," page 253) stand east of the two columns of rock that support the 20 -foot-high ceiling of this otherwise empty cave. Characters who enter the area through the northwest tunnel can't see the golems right away because the rock columns provide total cover.
The golems are hostile toward any creature that doesn't look like Halaster. A character disguised as Halaster can make a Charisma (Deception) check contested by the golems' Wisdom (Insight) check, with advantage on the check if the portrayal is particularly convincing. On a successful check, the golem won't attack that character unless the character attacks it.

## 9в. Arch Gate to Level 15

Rubble. The floor of this 50 -foot-high cavern is strewn with the remains of a dozen gargoyles. (The gargoyles once guarded the gate in this cavern, but the Stonecloaks destroyed them.)
Arch. A ramp hugs the south wall and climbs to a 20 -foot-high ledge. A stone arch is embedded in the wall at the west end of the ledge.
The arch is one of Halaster's gates (see "Gates," page 12). It is composed of one hundred stone jigsaw pieces, each weighing 10 pounds. The rules of this gate are as follows:

- Only one piece of the arch can be removed at any given time. A detect magic spell reveals that one of the pieces (determined randomly) is magical. When that piece is removed from the arch, it disappears, and the gate opens for 1 minute. When the gate closes, the piece removed from the arch magically reappears in its proper place, and a different piece becomes magical and must be removed to reopen the gate.
- If a wrong piece is removed from the arch, a beholder magically appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of the arch and attacks any creature it can see. The beholder disappears when it is slain or after 1 minute. When the beholder disappears, the piece that was removed from the arch magically reappears in its previous place.
- Characters must be 13th level or higher to pass through this gate (see "Jhesiyra Kestellharp," page 10). The first creature to pass through the gate triggers an elder rune (see "Elder Runes," page 12).
- A creature that passes through the gate appears in area 15 on level 15 , in the closest unoccupied space next to the identical gate located there.
Puzzle Piece. On the ledge near the arch, not visible from the cavern floor, a 25 -pound chunk of smooth stone is carved in the shape of a jigsaw puzzle piece and painted with part of an unknown image on one side. This stone is the missing piece of the jigsaw puzzle in area 10.

---

## 10. Mad Mage's Puzzle

Indentation. A 4-inch-deep, 8 -foot-wide, 10 -foot-long rectangular indentation is carved into the floor of this 20 -foot-high cavern.
Jigsaw Pieces. A loose pile of carved, painted stones stands near the south wall.
The pile contains ninety-nine chunks of stone, each weighing 25 pounds and carved in the shape of a jigsaw puzzle piece. The pieces form an image of Halaster, his head thrown back in laughter as he rides a great blue dragon. With a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check, a character can fit all the puzzle pieces together with 1 hour's work. If other characters assist, the character gains advantage on the check, but the time to complete the puzzle is not reduced. When all the pieces are placed, the characters realize that one puzzle piece is missing. (It can be found in area 9b.)
When all one hundred jigsaw puzzle pieces are placed properly in the rectangular indentation on the floor, an elder rune appears above it and targets a random creature in the cave (see "Elder Runes," page 12). Draw a card from the Elder Runes Deck (appendix B) to determine which rune appears.

## 11. Weird Magic

Halaster fills these caves with magical effects designed to confound adventurers.

## 1la. Hammer Time

Motes. This 20 -foot-high cave is dimly lit by dozens of tiny, tinkling motes of light that flit about like moths. Golem. Swinging ineffectually at the lights is a stone golem that has stone mallets at the end of its arms instead of hands.
The hammer-handed golem is carved to resemble Halaster (see "Stonecloaks," page 253) and is hostile toward any creature that doesn't look like the Mad Mage. When the golem hits a creature with one of its mallets, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of its next turn.
A character disguised as Halaster can make a Charisma (Deception) check contested by the golem's Wisdom (Insight) check, with advantage on the check if the portrayal is particularly convincing. On a successful check, the golem is indifferent toward that character.
The magical light motes are harmless but attracted to movement, and they swirl around any creatures that pass through the cave. The lights can't be dispelled, but they are suppressed in the area of an antimagic field spell or similar effect.

## 11b. Statue of Transformation

This dead-end cave has a domed ceiling 15 feet high. A 5 -foot-tall statue stands atop a 2 -foot-tall granite plinth near the east wall. The ancient-looking statue depicts a hooded woman with her hands cupped in front of her. Part of the statue's head has broken off, and spongy white toadstools are growing out from the broken stone.

The statue is a Medium object with AC 17, 30 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. A detect magic spell reveals an aura of transmutation magic around it. Whenever a nonmagical object weighing 10 pounds or less is placed in the statue's cupped hands, it turns into a different object as determined by rolling percentile dice and consulting the Object Transformation table. The statue becomes nonmagical if it loses more than half its hit points.

## Object Transformation

| d100 | New Object |
| :-- | :-- |
| $01-10$ | Bag of 20 caltrops $(2 \mathrm{lb})$. |
| $11-25$ | Bar of soap $(1 / 4 \mathrm{lb})$. |
| $26-35$ | Clay bowl containing 20 candied plums $(1 \mathrm{lb})$. |
| $36-50$ | Dead, rotting fish $(2 \mathrm{lb})$. |
| $51-60$ | Full water skin $(5 \mathrm{lb})$. |
| $61-75$ | Hunk of moldy cheese $(1 / 4 \mathrm{lb})$. |
| $76-90$ | Stirge meat pie $(1 \mathrm{lb})$ served piping hot |
| $91-00$ | Magic Halaster doll $(1 \mathrm{lb})$ that says something |
|  | each time it is squeezed |

Each time an object is removed from the statue's cupped hands, there is a 20 percent chance that the white toadstools growing out of the statue's broken head release a cloud of milky-white spores. The cloud fills a 20 -foot-radius sphere centered on the statue and lasts for 1 minute. Any creature that starts its turn in the cloud must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or contract a disease called blinding sickness, which lasts until cured with a lesser restoration spell or similar magic. Pain grips the diseased creature's mind, and its eyes turn milky white. Until the disease is cured, the creature is blinded and has disadvantage on Wisdom checks and Wisdom saving throws.
Sunlight or any effect that deals fire damage or radiant damage destroys the toadstools.

## 11c. Unreliable Oracle

This empty, 10 -foot-high cavern has a large question mark carved into the east wall. If anyone asks a question in this cave, a whispering voice replies with an answer dsetermined by rolling percentile dice and consulting the Oracle Answers table.

## Oracle Answers

d100 Answer
01-25 "No more answers today! Come back tomorrow." The oracle then ceases to function for 24 hours.
26-40 "You already know the answer."
41-65 "Ah, one of life's great mysteries."
66-80 "Can you please rephrase the question?"
81-00 "Hold, please." This answer is followed by 1d10 minutes of instrumental music, during which time the oracle answers no further questions. When the music ends, roll again on this table.

## 12. Old Behir Lair

A mated pair of behirs once occupied this corner of the dungeon, but the Stonecloaks killed them.

## 12a. Bones and Stones

Uneven Surfaces. The cavern's roof and floor are jagged and uneven, with the distance between them ranging from 10 to 30 feet.
Scorched Walls. The walls are covered with scorch marks (from the behirs' lightning).
Skeletons. The skeletons of two enormous, multilegged reptiles (behirs) lie in the middle of the cavern, surrounded by glimmering blue scales.
Shattered Statue. Rubble from what looks like a large statue are spread around the skeletons.
The behirs were smashed to a pulp by Halaster's stone golems, but their skulls and bones are mostly intact.
One of Halaster's stone golems was destroyed in the battle that took place here. Among its shattered limbs and various unrecognizable fragments, characters can find the right half of the golem's shattered head. A detect magic spell reveals an aura of illusion magic around the partial head. The first time a character approaches within 10 feet of the head, the source of the aura becomes apparent as a magic mouth spell cast on it says, in Ezzat's voice and in Common:
Down and down and down once more
Awaits the mad one's doom;
Between there and here, heaven's tears.
Evil knocking on the Far Realm's door.

## 12b. Treasure Cave

This cave contains a hoard left behind by the behirs.
Treasure. The behirs' unguarded hoard consists of $12,000 \mathrm{cp}, 5,450 \mathrm{sp}, 1,825 \mathrm{gp}$, four garnets ( 100 gp each), a dwarven burial circlet fashioned from mithral and set with four aquamarines $(2,500 \mathrm{gp})$, and a chime of opening.

## 12c. Column of Eyes

A natural column of rock stands in the entrance to this cave. A detect magic spell reveals an aura of conjuration magic surrounding the column. Whenever a creature comes within 10 feet of the column, dozens of eyes open on its surface, staring in all directions. The eyes follow creatures that move past the column, but they are only harmless magical effects created by Halaster. Casting dispel magic on the column removes the eyes from it permanently.
The cave once served as a larder for the behirs. It is strewn with the bones of past victims: unlucky adventurers, duergar, drow, quaggoths, cloakers, darkmantles, hook horrors, and umber hulks. Nothing of value can be found among the bones.

## 13. Runestone Caverns

An immense central cavern (area 13a) has several smaller caverns extending off it (areas 13b through 13f). A howling wind echoes throughout this area, and its source can be traced to a broad chasm (area 13g).

## 13a. Main Cavern

Characters see a bright blue-white light ahead as they approach this cavern. The cave's features are as follows:
Runestone. The cavern is lit by a 10 -foot-diameter circular lozenge of crystal (the Runestone) embedded at the peak of a 120 -foot-tall stalagmite.
Stalactites. The cavern walls taper inward as they rise, becoming a curved, 200 -foot-high ceiling dotted with stalactites 10 to 15 feet long. A 60 -foot-long stalactite hangs directly above the stalagmite tower, its tip 10 feet above the brightly glowing Runestone.
Stalagmites. The cavern floor is level and dotted with stalagmites 10 to 15 feet high.
Each time the characters visit this area, there is a 25 percent chance that Halaster links to the Runestone and uses it to spy on the main cavern. If he sees the characters and has any reason to want them dead, Halaster casts spells with a suitably long range at them through the Runestone, including Bigby's hand, chain lightning, fireball, and meteor swarm, as the opportunity presents itself. See area 14 for information on the Runestone.

## 13b. Glaring Gargoyles

This side cavern has an uneven floor and ceiling 50 feet high and is adorned with a scattering of stalagmites and stalactites. Three gargoyles perch atop 10 -foot-high stalagmites. These servants of Halaster watch and listen to the Runestone, waiting for new commands from their lord and master. The gargoyles attack any group of creatures they outnumber, but they avoid the Stonecloaks.

## 13c. Moldy Cave

Water drips from the ceiling onto a floor carpeted in thick gray mold. The mold is edible but not nutritious.

## 13d. Rotting Xorn Carcass

Rats and vermin nibble away at the rotting carcass of a xorn that lies at the back of this cave. Seven days ago, the xorn ran afoul of the golem in area 2 and was mortally wounded. It retreated to this cavern and died here.

Treasure. Cutting open the xorn's carcass reveals an undigested ring of $x$-ray vision and a lumpy, half-digested topaz ( 50 gp ).

## 13e. Old Campsite

A ring of fire-scarred stones near the north wall of this 10 -foot-high cave marks a long-abandoned campsite. Someone has used a knife to scratch the following warning, in Dwarvish, into the east wall: "The Mad Mage watches us. The Runestone is his eye!"

## 13f. Halaster's Head

Lying on the floor of this otherwise empty 10 -foot-high cave is an oversized stone head resembling the head of Halaster Blackcloak. The stone head once belonged to a Stonecloak that was cannibalized by the renegade golem in area 2.

## 13g. Gusting Chasm

A howling, 60 -mile-per-hour wind blows up and out of this 300 -foot-deep chasm. A magical effect created by Halaster, the wind is strong enough in the immediate

---

vicinity of the chasm to snuff out torches and other open flames of a nonmagical nature.
The chasm has abundant handholds and is easily climbed. Characters who descend to the floor find it jagged, uneven, and littered with the broken pieces of stone golems (lossed into the chasm by the mad golem in area 2), four dead gargoyles in pieces, and the bones of a dwarf (a miner who slipped and fell into the chasm over a century ago). The miner's pick lies near the bones.

## 14. The Runestone

The tip of the giant stalagmite at the center of area 13a is pierced by a large hole. Set within this hole is a 10 -foot-diameter, circular lozenge of translucent white crystal called the Runestone. The crystal radiates bright blue-white light in a 120 -foot radius and dim light for an additional 120 feet. Halaster's red-glowing rune floats inside it.
The Runestone is a Large object with AC 10; 90 hit points; immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons that aren't adamantine; and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Provided it has at least 1 hit point, the crystal can magically repair itself, regaining 10 (3d6) hit points each hour.
As an action, Halaster can establish a magical link with the Runestone from anywhere inside Undermountain, provided the crystal hasn't been destroyed. This link allows him to see, speak, and cast spells through the Runestone as though he were standing in its space. Spells he casts through the Runestone appear to originate from the rune lodged inside it. Halaster can end the link at any time (no action required).
While Halaster is linked to the Runestone, its light changes from blue-white to red-orange, and Halaster's rune turns from bright red to fluorescent purple. The brightness and extent of the light doesn't change.

## Capturing IPSES

Characters who lurk outside the stalagmite tower long enough might see Ezzat open the outer door to release his pseudodragon, Ipses (see area 17). The lich stands in the open doorway while Ipses hunts vermin and gathers up any Runestone fragments it finds in the surrounding cavern. Once the pseudodragon has eaten and taken care of business, it returns to the tower. The outer door then shuts and locks as Ezzat and Ipses retreat inside.
Ipses has long been denied the taste of good food and simply can't resist an offering of fruit, candy, cheese, or some other delicacy. If the pseudodragon goes missing in the cavern, Ezzat locks up the tower and searches for it. Characters who capture Ipses can hold the pseudodragon hostage and use it to wring information from Ezzat, as you determine. (See "Roleplaying Ezzat," page 262, for more information.)
In exchange for the pseudodragon's safe return, the lich also offers to trade the potions in area 20. If the characters demand more, Ezzat throws in what he claims is a staff of frost. If that deal is done, the sentient staff (see area 16) reveals its true nature and attacks Ipses's abductors as soon as the pseudodragon is safe.

## Runestone Fragments

The surface of the Runestone is rough and splintered. Every 12 hours, a pebble-sized fragment of the Runestone breaks off and falls to the cavern floor, though the Runestone shows no signs of ever being diminished by shedding these fragments. A broken-off fragment is magical but no longer glows. It comes to rest $1 \mathrm{ld} \times 10$ feet from the base of the stalagmite.

Ezzat's pseudodragon companion, Ipses, gathers up Runestone fragments as it hunts for food around the stalagmite, but a few occasionally escape its notice. A character who examines the cavern floor around the spire with a detect magic spell finds 1d4 fragments. Without such magical aid, a character can find one fragment with a 1-hour search and a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check.
Halaster has discovered a process for implanting Runestone fragments in constructs to imbue them with more intelligence and personality. These fragments might also have other magical properties, at your discretion.
Delivering a Runestone fragment to Jalester Silvermane in Waterdeep completes a quest (see "Retrieve a Runestone Fragment," page 9).

## Stalagmite Tower

The stalagmite tower at the center of the main cavern is 120 feet tall and has chambers hollowed out of the lower two-thirds of its height. Those hollowed-out areas have 3 -foot-thick outer walls, 2 -foot-thick inner walls, and 3 -foot-thick floors, all hewn from solid rock. All ceilings in the tower are 20 feet high. The outer surface of the stalagmite has numerous footholds and ledges, and can be climbed with a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.
The stalagmite tower is impervious to damage, as well as to magic that would alter its form (such as a stone shape spell) or create openings through it (such as a passwall spell or a portable hole). A creature can exit the tower by using magic, but the tower prevents any creature from entering it in similar fashion. Spells such as dimension door or teleport thus can't be used to get inside the tower, nor can creatures be magically summoned inside it by anyone except Ezzat.
No constructs can approach within 10 feet of the stalagmite. Such creatures encounter what feels like an unbreakable wall of force surrounding the entire stalagmite and extending under the cavern floor.

## 15. Outer Door and Foyer

The tower entrance is on the eastern side of the stalagmite and offers the only access to Ezzat's lair.

## Outer Door

Bas-Relief. The outward-facing side of the door bears a bas-relief sculpture of a humanoid skull with a black sapphire embedded in each eye socket.
Words of Unwelcome. Carved into the frame above the door are the words "GO AWAY!" written in Common.
Alarm. An alarm spell silently warns Ezzat if any other creature opens the door.

---

A detect magic spell reveals a powerful aura of abjuration magic around each sapphire. Close examination reveals the image of a tiny black spider etched into each one. Two drow vampires are trapped in the gemstones and are magically released the first time a creature other than Ezzat opens the door or pries either gemstone out. Each vampire initially appears as a cloud of mist, then spends its first turn in combat reverting to its true form. The vampires' names are Sabatene Xilzzrin and Tebran Madannith. Their houses were destroyed long ago. They have spent the last fifty years imprisoned by Ezzat, thirsting for blood.
Neither Sabatene nor Tebran can enter the stalagmite without Ezzat's invitation, since the tower is his residence. Far removed from their resting places, they have nowhere to go if their physical forms are destroyed. A drow vampire reduced to 72 hit points or fewer attempts to flee rather than risk destruction. Although they have common enemies and similar needs, the two vampires are allies only by circumstance and care nothing for each other.
Treasure. The black sapphires ( 500 gp each) can be pried out of the door with a dagger or similar tool.

## FOYER

A wooden coat rack stands in the north corner of this otherwise empty room.

## 16. Animated Staff

Light. Wax candles in stone holders light the room.
Furnishings. In the middle of the room, a wooden chair faces a small wooden table upon which rests a game board topped with painted figurines.
Staff. Floating next to the table is a 5 -foot-long staff made of chiseled ice.
Ezzat animated a staff of frost and imbued it with sentience. Because of the alterations made to it, the staff is a creature and no longer usable as a magic item.
The animated staff is a Medium construct with AC 17, 40 hit points, resistance to cold damage, immunity to poison damage, a flying speed of 30 feet, and the ability to hover. It has blindsight out to a range of 60 feet and is blind beyond this radius. The staff's alignment is neutral evil. It can speak and understand Common. It has the following ability scores: Strength 12, Dexterity 12, Constitution 10, Intelligence 18, Wisdom 14, Charisma 10. Reducing the staff to 0 hit points destroys it.
The staff is friendly toward Ezzat and Ipses (the lich's pseudodragon), and hostile toward all other creatures. It has no concern for its own well-being and fights without mercy. Ezzat calls off the staff if its destruction seems likely, or if he has cause to parley with intruders.
The staff can use its action to make a melee weapon attack against a creature within 5 feet of it: +5 to hit; 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage plus 1 cold damage on a hit.
The staff has 10 charges. As an action, it can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 12): cone of cold (5 charges), fog cloud (1 charge), ice storm (4 charges), or wall of ice (4 charges). It regains $1 \mathrm{~d} 6+4$ expended charges daily at dawn. If the staff expends its last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff turns to water and is destroyed.

## Roleplaying Ezzat

Ezzat was a mage who had an opportunity to become Halaster's apprentice. A good-aligned human priest discouraged him from pursuing that evil path. After his priest friend died of old age and Ezzat became a lich to avoid a similar fate, he became obsessed with finding a way not only to destroy Halaster but to gain control over Undermountain.
Ezzat is a lich who speaks Common, Dwarvish, Draconic, Elvish, Sylvan, and Undercommon. He plans to destroy Halaster when he's good and ready. Until then, he'd rather not be disturbed. If the characters ask for help in destroying Halaster, the lich shares what he knows about the Mad Mage but declines to aid them in any other way. Assume that Ezzat knows all the information about Halaster given in appendix A, including the Mad Mage's lair actions and regional effects, but not his statistics.
If the characters appear intent on destroying Ezzat, the lich accuses them of being the unwitting tools of the Mad Mage. He uses all the magic at his disposal to get rid of them. See areas 16 and 17 for more information.

A creature can grab the staff out of the air with a successful grapple check against the staff, and grappling the staff does not reduce the creature's speed. Any creature that successfully grapples the staff must succeed on a DC 12 Charisma saving throw or be charmed by the staff until the staff is no longer in its grasp. While the creature is charmed, the staff can issue commands to it, which the creature does its best to obey. The creature can repeat the saving throw each time it takes damage, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that successfully resists the staff's control can't be charmed by it for 24 hours.
A creature holding the staff that isn't charmed by it can use an action to attempt to break the staff over a knee or against a solid surface, doing so with a successful DC 17 Strength (Athletics) check. Breaking the staff in this manner destroys it.

## Treasure

The game on the table is called Coroniir, more commonly known as crowns. A game of strategy like chess, it enables two players to reenact a battle of the Crown Wars between two elven coronals. The set features a varnished oak game board and painted wooden figurines, weighs 5 pounds, and is worth 250 gp intact. The game board doubles as a carrying case for the figurines.
The position of the figurines on the board suggests that a game is in progress. The staff is waiting for Ezzat to return so that they can finish their game, which the lich is presently four moves away from winning. The staff moves its own pieces.

## 17. Lich's Study

Ezzat the lich spends much of his time in this dusty, cobweb-filled room, poring over books that claim to shed light on Halaster's mastery of Undermountain. The lich's neutral evil pseudodragon companion, Ipses, stays close to its master.
Light. Dozens of wax candles light the room, perched atop candle holders or affixed to skulls, petrified rats, and other miscellaneous objects.

---

Books. The room is cluttered with stacks of books, most of them caked with dust (see "Books" below).
Desk and Chair. A path between the books leads from the door to an old desk and chair by the east wall.
Stairs. A spiral staircase climbs to area 18.
If the characters discover the lich here, see the "Roleplaying Ezzat" sidebar for guidelines on determining his reaction. The characters gain no XP for defeating Ezzat unless they also destroy the lich's phylactery (located in area 23).
Ezzat has the forcecage spell prepared instead of plane shift, and he wears an amulet of proof against detection and location that conceals him from divination magic and scrying sensors.
Ezzat's pseudodragon is selfish and doesn't like sharing its master with strangers. The lich lets the pseudodragon out of the tower once a day so that it can catch food and scour the cavern floor for Runestone fragments (see "Capturing Ipses," page 261).
Ezzat enjoys the pseudodragon's company but does not need its assistance in battle. If a fight breaks out, Ipses settles atop the lintel of the nearest door and tries to stay out of harm's way. It has little cause to fear for the destruction of its master as long as Ezzat's phylactery remains secure in area 23. Ipses won't willingly betray Ezzat by divulging the phylactery's location.

## BOOKS

Ezzat has amassed a large collection of books written by self-proclaimed experts on Undermountain. Most of the tomes are filled with information of questionable worth and accuracy. The lich has spent years separating truth from fiction, trying to learn how Halaster's command of the dungeon has gone unchallenged and how Undermountain changes to serve its master's whims.
Ezzat's Journal. A book lies open on the desk, next to a quill and a jar of ink. This is Ezzat's journal, a distillation of the lore found in his other books. Any character who reads the journal learns Undermountain's history (see "Dungeon History," page 6) as well as the ways in which the dungeon affects magic (see "Alterations to Magic," page 10). Ezzat's advanced understanding of this lore is what enabled him to create such potent magical defenses around his tower.
In later entries, Ezzat postulates that Jhesiyra Kestellharp, one of Halaster's original seven apprentices, is the key to seizing control of Undermountain (see "Jhesiyra Kestellharp," page 10). The lich describes how Jhesiyra was imprisoned by her master, only to escape during the Spellplague. She then used a wish spell to imbue herself into the stones of Undermountain and hide from Halaster.
Ezzat believes that Jhesiyra can affect Undermountain in ways that even Halaster cannot, and the lich longs to find some means to contact her. In the journal's final entry, he writes of wanting to use wish-a spell he does not yet know-to forge an alliance with Jhesiyra, defeat Halaster, and end the Mad Mage's reign in Undermountain forever. (The lich doesn't realize that Jhesiyra is beyond the reach of any mortal magic.)

## Treasure

Ezzat wears an amulet of proof against detection and location and carries an ebony wand ( 25 gp ) that he uses as an arcane focus.

## 18. Gnomes' Landing

Standing in an alcove at the top of the spiral staircase leading to this area is a 6 -foot-tall stone statue depicting three smiling gnomes balanced precariously on each other's shoulders.

## 19. Ezzat's Scrying Mirror

Mounted on the south wall 6 inches above the floor is a 3 -foot-wide, 9 -foot-tall rectangular mirror with a stone frame. Carved into the top of the frame is a hu-man-sized eyeball.
Ezzat uses the mirror as a focus for his scrying spell. Whenever this mirror is used to scry Halaster, the spell appears to succeed automatically but shows a false image of Halaster sweeping a dungeon floor with a broom. The image pauses every few minutes to wave at the viewer, do a little dance, or strum the broom as if it were a guitar. Ezzat understands that this scene is one of Halaster's magical tricks, and he does not bother trying to scry the Mad Mage from here.

## 20. LABORATORY

Table. A stone table cluttered with decrepit alchemical apparatus and dirty bottles of reagents stands at the center of the room. Among the clutter on the table is a small clay bowl containing crystal pebbles (see "Runestone Fragments").
Cabinet. A narrow cabinet with glass doors stands in the northwest corner.
Stairs. A stone staircase with no railing hugs the outer wall and climbs to area 21.
The bowl contains six crystal pebbles, each one a Runestone fragment that has been collected by Ipses the pseudodragon (see area 14). Bringing a fragment to Jalester Silvermane in Waterdeep completes a quest (see "Retrieve a Runestone Fragment," page 9).

## Treasure

Sitting on the top shelf of the cabinet are two potions of resistance (force and lightning). The other shelves are strewn with spell components, including two forked mithral rods ( 250 gp each). These are material components for the plane shift spell, attuned to the Astral Plane and the Shadowfell, respectively. They serve little use in Undermountain, given the dungeon's restrictions on such magic.

## 21. Lit Landing

A small crystal embedded in the ceiling flickers with the light of a candle flame. If the crystal is pried from its cavity, it goes dark. This room is otherwise empty.

## 22. Rooms of Magic

Ezzat summons and speaks to planar beings in area 22a, and keeps his spellbook in area 22b.

---

## 22a. Magic Circle

Circle. A circle of runes is inscribed on the floor.
Door Symbol. The door to area 22b has a large symbol chiseled into it. (The symbol is Ezzat's personal sigil, which appears nowhere else in the tower. It is purely decorative.)
A character who examines the circle and succeeds on a DC 13 Intelligence (Arcana) check can determine that it confers the same benefit as a magic circle spell that affects celestials, elementals, fey, and fiends all at once. The circle is permanent, but defacing any part of its inscribed length renders it nonmagical.

## 22b. Ezzat's Spellbook

Statue. A shallow alcove holds a 6 -foot-tall painted statue of Ezzat as he appeared in life. A leather-bound tome (Ezzat's spellbook) is clutched to the statue's chest.
Secret Door. Hidden in the ceiling is a secret door leading to area 23 (see "Stone Plug" below).
The statue projects an antipathy effect like that created by an antipathy/sympathy spell (save DC 20) while the spellbook is in its grasp. The spell affects all creatures except Ezzat and is inactive whenever the spellbook is removed from the statue.
No spells or other magical effects can move or damage the statue, which is a Medium object with AC 17, 33 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. If the statue is destroyed, it turns to dust. A delayed blast fireball spell (save DC 20) then immediately detonates in its space.
Stone Plug. The secret door in the ceiling is an airtight, circular stone plug 8 feet in diameter. A character who examines the ceiling closely can spot the circular seam in the rock with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check.
The stone plug, which weighs 1,000 pounds, has its rim beveled to keep the plug from falling through the hole. It can be pushed upward with a telekinesis spell or similar magic, or obliterated entirely with a disintegrate spell. Characters who have a combined Strength of 34 or higher can push the plug out of the hole, provided they have something firm to stand on.
Treasure. Ezzat's spellbook weighs 13 pounds and contains all the spells the lich has prepared, plus the following: alarm, arcane lock, burning hands, charm person, clairvoyance, comprehend languages, cone of cold, delayed blast fireball, Evard's black tentacles, fear, feeblemind, flesh to stone, geas, hold person, ice storm, imprisonment, knock, levitate, magic mouth, maze, meteor swarm, mislead, plane shift, prismatic wall, remove curse, telekinesis, true polymorph, unseen servant, wall of force, and web.

## 23. Ezzat's Phylactery

Lich Cave. This room is carved to look like a natural cave with a 20 -foot-high, domed roof. Hundreds of pebble-sized crystals (fragments of the Runestone) line the walls, flickering like tiny stars as they catch the light.

Demon. A marilith demon slithers about the room. Phylactery. Lying in the middle of the floor is a small ornate metal box (Ezzat's phylactery).
Ezzat recently summoned the marilith to guard his phylactery. A geas spell cast on it by the lich requires the demon to protect the phylactery against theft or destruction. The marilith takes out its frustration at being stuck here by attacking intruders. If a character snatches the phylactery and flees, the marilith tries to pursue so as to avoid taking psychic damage from Ezzat's geas spell. The stone plug in the floor is too heavy for the marilith to lift.
A detect magic spell reveals an aura of transmutation magic radiating from the walls, which have more than six hundred Runestone fragments embedded in them. Each fragment extends the duration of the geas spell affecting the marilith by 30 days. The Runestone fragments disappear if the spell ends, their magic spent. The Runestone fragments can't be pried from the walls, since the same magic that protects the stalagmite tower from damage prevents their removal.

## Phylactery

Ezzat's phylactery is a box 6 inches long, 3 inches wide, and 4 inches tall that weighs 2 pounds. It is made of adamantine with gold trim, and its interior is inscribed with tiny silver runes. A detect magic spell reveals a powerful aura of necromancy magic around it. Any character who examines the box and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check recognizes it as a lich's phylactery. (For more information on lich phylacteries, see the "Lich" entry in the Monster Manual.)
Destroying Ezzat's phylactery requires that it be struck by eight disintegrate spells at the same time. A legend lore spell cast on the box provides the following insight: "Seek out eight magi who possess the power of disintegration and bring them to common purpose. Their combined force can destroy the phylactery." Other reliable divination spells provide similar advice.

## Aftermath

If the characters destroy Ezzat and give his phylactery to one of the genies on level 19 (or remove it from the dungeon themselves), the lich is effectively kicked out of Undermountain. This outcome pleases Halaster, who allows a promising apprentice to take over the stalagmite tower. Drivvin Freth, the drow archmage encountered on level 12, is a good choice. If Drivvin is unavailable, Halaster invites some other evil archmage to take up residence in the tower.
Halaster uses a magic scrying sensor (see "Halaster's Lair," page 311) to check on Haungharassk, his prized giant snail, once a day. If he discovers that the snail has been killed or stolen, the Mad Mage uses the Runestone to scream epithets that echo throughout the caverns.
If the characters destroy the Runestone, Halaster sets out to destroy all the gargoyles and Stonecloaks on this level for failing him. He then begins luring and binding demons to the Runestone Caverns-nalfeshnees, glabrezus, hezrous, and vrocks, for a start. Eventually, he might get around to trapping a demon lord here as well.
