# Appendix A: Dungeon Denizens

This appendix contains information on Halaster Blackcloak, as well as monsters and NPCs not found in the Monster Manual. After the Mad Mage, the creatures are in alphabetical order.

## Halaster Blackcloak

Halaster, the Mad Mage of Undermountain, is the deranged individual behind most of the traps and horrors found in the great dungeon under Waterdeep. Undermountain is his home, an amusement gallery in which others perform to entertain him.
The Mad Mage knows the ever-changing ways of Undermountain as no one else does, for he is the one who controls those changes. He prefers to remain unseen, skulking about invisibly or peering through scrying sensors that resemble wide-open eyes surrounded by sparkling motes of light.
Halaster's abilities far exceed those of most mortal wizards. His expertise with magic gates allows him to travel far and wide to engage in magical research. He

Special Equipment. Halaster wears a robe of eyes that lets him see in all directions, gives him darkvision out to a range of 120 feet, grants advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight, and allows him to see invisible creatures and objects, as well as into the Ethereal Plane, out to a range of 120 feet.
Halaster wields a blast scepter (a very rare magic item that requires attunement). It can be used as an arcane focus. Whoever is attuned to the blast scepter gains resistance to fire and lightning damage and can, as an action, use it to cast thunderwave as a 4th-level spell (save DC 16) without expending a spell slot.
Halaster also wears a horned ring (a very rare magic item that requires attunement), which allows an attuned wearer to ignore Undermountain's magical restrictions (see "Alterations to Magic," page 10).
Arcane Recovery (1/Day). When he finishes a short rest, Halaster recovers all his spell slots of 5th level and lower.
Legendary Resistance (3/Day). If Halaster fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

Rejuvenation. If Halaster dies in Undermountain, he revives after 1 d 10 days, with all his hit points and any missing body parts restored. His new body appears in a random safe location in Undermountain.

Spellcasting. Halaster is a 20th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 22, +14 to hit with spell attacks). He can cast disguise self and invisibility at will. He can cast fly and lightning bolt once each without expending a spell slot, but can't do so again until he finishes a short or long rest. Halaster has the following wizard spells prepared:
Cantrips (at will): dancing lights, fire bolt, light, mage hand, prestidigitation
1st level (4 slots): mage armor, magic missile, shield, silent image 2nd level (3 slots): arcane lock, cloud of daggers, darkvision, knock

## LEGENDARY Actions

Halaster can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Halaster regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

Spell Ward (Costs 2 Actions). Halaster expends a spell slot of 4th level or lower and gains 5 temporary hit points per level of the slot.

---

spends much of his time creating gates, moving them around, and casting elder runes on them. Halaster's gates connect the different levels of Undermountain, thus enabling him to bring new monsters into the dungeon to replenish those that die or escape. Even as groups of adventurers try to gain decisive control of just a small section of Undermountain's halls, Halaster constantly alters the dungeon's perils to thwart them.

Halaster's true form is that of a tall, gaunt, male human, but he uses magic to take on many other visages and shapes. No matter what form he wears, the Mad Mage giggles and mutters incessantly. Contrary to appearances, however, Halaster is alert and attentive to the activities and preparations of all beings near him. He never willingly enters combat without first casting maÄŸe armor and mind blank on himself.

## Halaster's Lair

As the master of Undermountain, Halaster can alter the entire dungeon to some extent. His lair actions and regional effects don't extend beyond Undermountain.

## Lair Actions

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Halaster takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:

- Halaster targets a volume of unoccupied space or solid stone no larger than four 10 -foot cubes within 30 feet of him, turning the open space to solid, worked stone or vice versa.
- Halaster causes one door or archway within 30 feet of him to disappear and be replaced by a blank wall, or he restores a door or an archway previously removed in this way.
- Halaster deactivates or reactivates one of Undermountain's magic gates. The gate must be within 120 feet of him.


## Regional Effects

When Halaster is in Undermountain, the following effects can occur in any location within the dungeon or in any extraplanar extension of the dungeon:

- A magical scrying sensor appears, taking the form of a ghostly, 1-foot-diameter humanoid eye surrounded by motes of light. The sensor is stationary, though Halaster can reorient the eye to face in any direction. Halaster can see through the eye as though he was in its space. The eye can't be harmed or dispelled, but it winks out within an antimagic field. A scrying eye lasts until Halaster ends the effect (no action required).
- A minor illusory effect is triggered, as though Halaster had cast minor illusion in an area. Common illusions include the echo of rattling chains, the distant sound of explosive spells being cast, a dusty cloak or a rusty helm floating as though worn by an invisible figure, and illusory footprints appearing on a dusty floor.
- Silent apparitions of dead adventurers drift through halls and rooms as though they are lost. An apparition can't be harmed, and it doesn't acknowledge creatures or objects in any way. It can't be dispelled but is suppressed within an antimagic field.


## ARCHDRUID

Archdruids watch over the natural wonders of their domains. They seldom interact with civilized folk unless there is a great threat to the natural order, and their lairs are often guarded by allied beasts, plants, and fey.

## Actions

Change Shape (2/Day). The archdruid magically polymorphs into a beast or elemental with a challenge rating of 6 or less, and can remain in this form for up to 9 hours. The archdruid can choose whether its equipment falls to the ground, melds with its new form, or is worn by the new form. The archdruid reverts to its true form if it dies or falls unconscious. The archdruid can revert to its true form using a bonus action on its turn.
While in a new form, the archdruid retains its game statistics and ability to speak, but its AC, movement modes, Strength, and Dexterity are replaced by those of the new form, and it gains any special senses, proficiencies, traits, actions, and reactions (except class features, legendary actions, and lair actions) that the new form has but that it lacks. It can cast its spells with verbal or somatic components in its new form.
The new form's attacks count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistances and immunity to nonmagical attacks.

## Champion

Champions are mighty warriors who honed their fighting skills in gladiatorial pits. To soldiers and other people who fight for a living, champions are as influential as nobles, and their presence is courted as a sign of status among rulers.

## Githyanki Gish

Their keen minds and psionic gifts allow the githyanki to master magic. Gish blend their magical abilities with swordplay to become dangerous foes in battle. Their specialized capabilities make them well suited for assassination, raiding, and espionage.

## Lava Child

Physically identical to one another, lava children have muscular builds and childish, perpetually grinning faces. Most are born in the Fountains of Creation, also known as the Plane of Magma, which is wedged between the Elemental Planes of Earth and Fire. Within volcanic caverns, lava children form communities, serving primordial beings out of fear or worshiping gods of earth and fire.
Though they're not violent by nature, lava children fiercely defend territory they claim as their own. Many

Creatsword. Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft ., one target. Hit: $12(2 \mathrm{~d} 6+5)$ slashing damage, plus $7(2 \mathrm{~d} 6)$ slashing damage if the champion has more than half of its total hit points remaining.

intruders have been fooled by a lava child's smile, believing themselves welcome when in fact they're about to be torn limb from limb. Lava children typically stick close to their lairs, but actively hunt when food grows scarce.
Lava Born. The first lava children were created by the merging of spirits of earth and fire. Upon reaching adulthood, a lava child gains the ability to procreate by itself. An adult lava child lays several eggs in its lifetime, which is roughly fifty years. These eggs incubate in pools of molten magma until they hatch. The pink, smiling newborn matures at the same rate as a human. The parent protects its offspring until the new lava child is strong enough to defend itself and forage on its own. Lava children eat meat, bones, paper, plants, and just about anything else not made of metal or stone. Cooked meat is their favorite.

## Living Spell

Areas of wild magic and sites that have been ravaged by powerful eldritch forces can give rise to spell effects that refuse to dissipate. These so-called living spells haunt the places where they were created, subsisting on ambient magical energy.
A living spell appears much like a normal spell effect, except that its magical energy lingers and moves with purpose.
Constructed Nature. A living spell doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
Magical Essence. The process that creates a living spell changes the nature of its magic. A living spell isn't subject to dispel magic and isn't affected by an antimagic field.

Like an overzealous butler or maid, a living unseen servant spell busies itself with tasks in hopes of pleasing its creator. It can wield simple weapons but prefers not to.
