# Level 16: Crystal Labyrinth

ITHYANKI RECENTLY TURNED THE CRYSTAL Labyrinth into an outpost of their interplanar empire. It houses a gate to Stardock, a hollowed-out asteroid in orbit around the planet Toril (one of many that form the asteroid cluster known as the Tears of Selûne). Together, the Crystal Labyrinth and Stardock are designed for four 14th-level characters. Those who defeat the monsters on this level should gain enough XP to advance halfway to 15 th level.
Before running this level of Undermountain, you should review the "Gith" entry in the Monster Manual, because it contains information that will help you roleplay githyanki effectively. Additional information about githyanki society can be found in Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes, although that resource is not required to run the Crystal Labyrinth.

## What Dwells Here?

Githyanki tracking a splinter colony of mind flayers to Undermountain seized this level and turned what was once a crystalline maze into a fortress. From here, they launch attacks against the mind flayers on level 17. The githyanki also transformed Stardock into a crèche: a fortress dedicated to raising and training young warriors. Because creatures do not age on the Astral Plane, the githyanki must bring their offspring to the Material Plane to mature. Unfamiliar with the asteroid's actual name, the githyanki refer to Stardock as Crèche K'liir.

## Githyanki

The militaristic githyanki who live in the Crystal Labyrinth and Stardock have three important tasks: protect the crèche, train young githyanki warriors, and destroy the mind flayer colony in Seadeeps (level 17).

## Knights and the Draconic Tongue

Githyanki knights encountered in the Crystal Labyrinth and Stardock speak Draconic in addition to their native language of Gith-all the better to communicate with their red dragon mounts.

## Githyanki Leaders

The githyanki are led by Al'chaia, a knight who is cruel to her trainees and soldiers. Al'chaia recently acquired a manual of gainful exercise and a tome of clear thought, and she has promised to award both items to her most accomplished soldier. In truth, she plans to read these tomes to gain their benefits herself, but uses the

## The Original Crystal Labyrinth

Undermountain: Stardock, written by Steven E. Schend and published in 1997, was the third of three modules in the short-lived "Dungeon Crawl" series of adventures designed for the second edition D\&D game. Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage presents alternative versions of the Crystal Labyrinth and Stardock scaled for fifth edition and this product. If you want to expand this level of Undermountain, the original adventure would be a fine source of inspiration.

## Crystal Golems

Crystal golems found throughout the Crystal Labyrinth look like 10 -foot-tall githyanki warriors. They understand Gith but can't speak, and they attack any creatures that don't look like githyanki or red dragons. Each crystal golem is a stone golem with these additional traits:
Illumination. The golem magically sheds bright light in a 30 -foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. This light goes out when the golem is destroyed.
Light Intensity. Any creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the illuminated golem and can see the golem must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be blinded until the start of the creature's next turn.
A creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see the golem until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the golem in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.
promise of this reward to trick her troops into running themselves ragged. Al'chaia's second in command, Urlon, is tired of the abuse and plots against her.

## Red Dragons

Ashtyrranthor, an adult red dragon, is mother to six young red dragons that live in the Crystal Labyrinth and defend Crèche K'liir. Ashtyrranthor's children are named Ashranthax, Blazutranc, Infernexus, Meteoranzym, Smoakcant, and Zolcharrx.

## Astyrranthor

Ashtyrranthor can't treat Stardock as her lair, so she has no lair actions here. However, she has the following Innate Spellcasting trait:
Innate Spellcasting. Ashtyrranthor's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma. She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:
1/day each: alarm, detect magic, gaseous form, misty step, passwall, see invisibility
Ashtyrranthor spends most of her time on the outer surface of the asteroid, prowling through the wreckage of spacefaring vessels that crashed into Stardock long ago. If combat breaks out inside Crèche K'liir, there is a 10 percent chance that she hears the disturbance. She investigates immediately, joining the battle in progress and using her gaseous form, misty step, and passwall spells to enter hard-to-reach locations. Ashtyrranthor also keeps a specific watch over areas 12f, 13, and 16a from outside the asteroid. If she sees trouble or intruders in those areas, she attacks at once.

## Crystal Dungeon

All area descriptions for this location are keyed to map 16. As one descends from level 15 or climbs up from level 17, the rough stone walls, floor, and ceiling give way to ever-widening veins of luminous crystal until every surface is made of the substance. In many areas, the githyanki have torn down the crystalline walls to create larger spaces.

Unless otherwise noted, the crystal dungeon has the following unique features:

- The dungeon is brightly lit throughout. The crystal walls, ceilings, and floor emit magical light that changes color every 10 minutes, shifting through all the hues of the rainbow.
- Doors are carved from single slabs of opaque white crystal similar in weight and consistency to stone.


## 1. Entry Hall

A crystal golem (see the "Crystal Golems" sidebar) stands guard here. It attacks any creature not escorted by a githyanki or a red dragon. If combat erupts here, the githyanki warriors from area 2a investigate.

## 2. Western Cavern

The githyanki knocked down several walls to create this chamber, and much of the debris has yet to be cleared.

## 2a. Ilmei's Watch

Crystal Stalactite. A 10 -foot-long crystal stalactite hangs above a pit filled with silvery mist. Encased in the stalactite is Ilmei, a female githyanki gish (see appendix A for statistics; see also "Crystal Stalactites," page 212).
Guards. Around the pit, four githyanki warriors (two males and two females) spar with each other to pass the time.
Fresh out of Crèche K'liir, the young githyanki warriors are hostile toward intruders. If two of them fall, the remaining ones retreat to area 3 b or dive into the pit.
Creatures that fall into the pit are immediately transported to the Astral Plane (see chapter 2 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for more information).

## 2b. Dragon Engravings

The walls of this chamber are engraved with images of armored githyanki knights riding red dragons.

## 2c. Illithid Heads

Twelve severed mind flayer heads are mounted on the east and west walls of this partially destroyed area. A detect magic spell reveals an aura of necromancy magic around each head, which is a Tiny object with AC 5, 3 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Reducing a head to 0 hit points destroys it. Whenever a head is destroyed, any remaining mind flayer heads in the area that haven't been destroyed emit a telepathic scream. Each creature in the room takes 1d6 psychic damage for each screaming head (maximum 12d6).

## 3. Main Cavern

Githyanki twins named Arbez and Surlock are contained within crystal stalactites in this cavern.

## 3a. Arbez's Watch

The creatures in area 3b investigate any disturbance in this portion of the cavern, which contains the following:
Crystal Stalactite. A 10 -foot-long crystal stalactite hangs above a pit filled with silvery mist. Encased in the stalactite is Arbez, a male githyanki gish (see appendix A for statistics; see also "Crystal Stalactites," page 212).

## Crystal Stalactites

Four githyanki gish (see appendix A) are encased in transparent crystal stalactites in areas 2, 3, and 6. While encased, these githyanki remain aware of their surroundings but don't require air, food, or water. Until the crystal around them is destroyed, they can't be targeted by attacks or subjected to magical effects. Moreover, they are restrained and can't use their War Magic feature or make longsword attacks. They cast spells through the crystal as though it wasn't there.

Each crystal stalactite is a Large inanimate object with AC 15,80 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. A stalactite reduced to 0 hit points shatters, freeing the githyanki within. A githyanki whose stalactite is destroyed is no longer restrained by it and falls into the pit of silvery mist below it, whereupon it returns to the Astral Plane.

Straw Dummies. Five freestanding straw dummies with the rough forms of mind flayers (marked X on map 16) stand north of the pit.
Creatures that fall into the pit are immediately transported to the Astral Plane (see chapter 2 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for more information).
Githyanki warriors use the straw dummies as targets in combat training exercises. Each is a Medium object with AC 10, 10 hit points, immunity to poison and psychic damage, and vulnerability to fire damage.

## 3в. Surloce's Watch

Crystal Stalactite. A 10 -foot-long crystal stalactite hangs above a pit filled with silvery mist. Encased in the stalactite is Surlock, a male githyanki gish (see appendix A for statistics; see also the "Crystal Stalactites" sidebar).
Knight and Dragon. Near the eastern edge of the pit, a female githyanki knight named Deslarr sits astride Ashranthax, a female young red dragon.
If they are not alerted to the characters' presence, Deslarr and the dragon chat in Draconic about how many illithids they must kill to prove themselves worthy of "Al'chaia's magic books." They fight to the death.
Creatures that fall into the pit are immediately transported to the Astral Plane (see chapter 2 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for more information).
Treasure. Deslarr carries a Stardock rod (see "Stardock Rods," page 214). Her plate armor is set with eight black jaspers ( 50 gp each) and eight amber gemstones ( 100 gp each).

## 4. BARRACKS

Ten beds with pale white crystal frames are set along the walls. At any given time, ten githyanki warriors are resting in this area. If they have not been alerted, the githyanki are asleep when the characters arrive. They are hostile toward intruders and fight to the death.

## 5. Prison Cell

The crystal doors to this room are magically locked, but they open automatically for any creature that carries a Stardock rod (see "Stardock Rods," page 214). There
are no physical locks to be picked, but a knock spell or similar magic also opens a door.
Magic wards in the room prevent any creature from teleporting into or out of it.

## Marquox

A mind flayer named Marquox uses its levitate spell to float in the center of this otherwise empty room. It was captured while it searched this level for its companions, Tel'zact and Yeluit (see area 29c).
Marquox doesn't know why the githyanki are keeping it alive, but it knows it won't survive long in their captivity. If the characters don't attack it at once, Marquox proposes a deal. If they free it and help it rescue its companions, Marquox guarantees the party safe passage through level 17. A successful DC 16 Wisdom (Insight) check reveals that the illithid has no intention of making good on its promise. If the githzerai zerths from level 15 are with the party, they refuse to help the mind flayer and insist that the characters kill it. If the characters choose Marquox over them, the githzerai abandon the party and withdraw to level 15.
Marquox knows about Stardock but has never visited the asteroid. It also knows that the gate to Stardock is in area 11, and that a black crystal rod is needed to activate it. If the characters allow it, Marquox follows them to Stardock, fighting alongside them until it reunites with its kin. At that point, the mind flayers either turn against the party (if the characters appear weak) or lure the characters to the mind flayer colony on level 17, where Extremiton (the colony's ulitharid leader) can decide what to do with them.

## 6. Eastern Cavern

The githyanki knocked down several walls to create this chamber, and much of the debris remains.

## 6A. Mirrk's Watch

Crystal Stalactite. A 10 -foot-long crystal stalactite hangs above a pit filled with silvery mist. Encased in the stalactite is Mirrk, a female githyanki gish (see appendix A for statistics; see also "Crystal Stalactites," page 212).
Guards. Unless they have been lured elsewhere, six githyanki warriors (three females and three males) stand guard around the edge of the pit in the squares marked W on map 16.
The warriors speak in Gith about their dislike of Al'chaia and their respect for Urlon. They are hostile toward intruders and fight until three or more of them fall, whereupon the remaining warriors retreat to area 7 or dive into the pit.
Creatures that fall into the pit are immediately transported to the Astral Plane (see chapter 2 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for more information).

## 6B. Scrying Chamber

The north wall of this chamber hums and glows purple. A detect magic spell reveals an aura of divination magic radiating from the wall. Any creature that spends 1 minute touching the wall can cast the scrying spell targeting the ulitharid on level 17, using the wall as a focus. A

---

character who examines the wall can, with a successful DC 14 Intelligence (Arcana) check, ascertain that it's a scrying device and figure out how it works.

## 7. Anti-Illithid Defense

Two crystal golems (see "Crystal Golems," page 210) guard this room. They attack any creature that enters this area unescorted by a githyanki, a crystal golem, or a red dragon. If combat breaks out in this chamber, the githyanki warriors in area 6a come to investigate.
A permanent enchantment in this chamber grants any creature in the area advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and causes the levitate and detect thoughts spells to automatically fail when cast.

## 8. Officer Quarters

Four beds with pale white crystal frames are set along the walls. A male githyanki knight named Eshant and a male githyanki gish (see appendix A) named Theru stand in the middle of the room, engaged in a tense debate. Characters who get close to this area without alerting the githyanki hear the two arguing in Gith about which of them is worthier of "Al'chaia's magic books." The debate is intense but stops short of physical violence. If the characters don't interrupt, the gish eventually backs down and withdraws to area 9 to cool his heels. Eshant and Theru attack intruders on sight.

## Treasure

Eshant and Theru carry one Stardock rod apiece (see "Stardock Rods," page 214).
Eshant's plate armor is set with six black jaspers ( 50 gp each) and six red spinels ( 100 gp each). Eshant also carries a potion of greater healing in a crystal vial worn on a thin platinum chain ( 25 gp ) around his neck.

## 9. Trophy Room

Stuffed Ulitharid. A 10 -foot-tall, stuffed ulitharid (see appendix A) stands in a 15 -foot-high alcove along the south wall of the room.
Illithid Heads. Fifteen mounted mind flayer heads decorate the walls.

## 10. Golem Laboratory

Urlon. Urlon, a male githyanki gish (see appendix A), is using a set of mason's tools to carve the head of a half-completed crystal golem lying atop a 10 -footlong, 5 -foot-wide, 4 -foot-high table in the west side of the room.
Golem. A crystal golem (see "Crystal Golems," page 210) stands guard in the east side of the room, surrounded by shelves stacked with books, spell components, pieces of crystal, and mind flayer skulls.
The crystal golem doesn't attack unless Urlon orders it to do so, or if the characters attack it or Urlon first.
Urlon does not attack the characters unless he has no other choice. Believing that his superior, Al'chaia, is a tyrant unfit for command, he tries to use the characters to eliminate her. This is true even if the characters are accompanied by githzerai from level 15; unlike most
githyanki, Urlon sympathizes with githzerai and doesn't regard them with utter contempt.
If the characters are willing to listen, Urlon tells them in Common that Al'chaia keeps two magic tomes meant to enhance strength and intellect in a chest in her quarters on Crèche K'liir. If the characters offer to kill Al'chaia, Urlon opens the gate in area 11 for them. Urlon won't accompany the characters, however, since doing so would surely compromise his ability to assume command once Al'chaia is dead. He doesn't care whether they keep Al'chaia's magic books or not.
To earn the characters' trust, Urlon answers any questions they have about the current state of the Crystal Labyrinth and the asteroid. If the characters attack him, Urlon retreats to Stardock by way of the gate in area 11 while the crystal golem covers his escape.

## Treasure

Urlon carries a Stardock rod (see "Stardock Rods," page 214), a set of mason's tools, and a green crystal wand (his arcane focus).
Amid the worthless skulls, spell components, and crystal fragments on the shelves are several books of interest:

- Wedged between red crystal bookends carved in the likeness of red dragons ( 250 gp for the pair) is a six-volume doctrine of planar philosophy written in Common titled The Spectrum of Multiversal Beliefs, which delves deeply into the conflicting cosmic philosophies of several different planar factions. Each volume is worth 250 gp separately, but the complete set is worth 2,500 gp.
- Stacked one atop another are three identical spellbooks shared by the githyanki gish. Each of these books contains the spells that Urlon and his fellow gish normally prepare (see appendix A), plus detect magic, fabricate, haste, hold person, and shield.


## 11. Stardock Gate

The crystal doors to this room are magically locked, but they open automatically for any creature that carries a Stardock rod (see "Stardock Rods," page 214). There are no physical locks to be picked, but a knock spell or similar magic also opens a door.
The room contains the following:
Golem. A crystal golem (see "Crystal Golems," page 210) stands in the southernmost section of the room. It attacks any creature not escorted by a githyanki, a crystal golem, or a red dragon.
Gate to Stardock. In the western section of the room, a stone arch set with glowing red crystals is embedded in the south wall.
Pedestal. Rising from the floor 10 feet in front of the arch is a 3 -foot-high pedestal made of red crystal with a small hole in the top.
Together, the arch and pedestal comprise a teleportation gate. The hole bored into the top of the pedestal is 1 inch wide and 6 inches deep. When a Stardock rod (see "Stardock Rods," page 214) is inserted into the hole, the solid wall inside the arch disappears for 1 minute, replaced by an open doorway to area 12a. This

---

## Stardock Rods

A Stardock rod is a 1-foot-long black crystal rod that is needed to open the magic gate in area 11 and its corresponding gate in area 12a. A Stardock rod weighs 1 pound, radiates an aura of conjuration magic under the scrutiny of a detect magic spell, and has no other magical properties.
magic gate remains open while the rod is in place and closes 1 minute after the rod is removed from the pedestal. While the gate is open, creatures in this room can clearly see into area 12a, and vice versa.
The pedestal and the archway are impervious to damage, and the red crystals embedded in the arch can't be removed. The first time a creature tries to pry a crystal from the arch, a random elder rune appears above the pedestal, targets a random creature within 60 feet of it, then disappears (see "Elder Runes," page 12). Determine the elder rune randomly by drawing a card from the Elder Runes Deck (see appendix B).

## Stardock

All area descriptions for this location are keyed to map 16.
Originally carved by dragons, the asteroid known as Stardock orbits the planet Toril-one of hundreds that form the asteroid belt known as the Tears of Selûne. Over ages, illithids, undead mages, and spacefaring pirates have fought over and expanded Stardock's halls, but the asteroid was long abandoned by the time the githyanki and their red dragon allies moved in. The asteroid's features are as follows:

- The restrictions on magic in Undermountain don't apply here, since Stardock is outside the dungeon.
- Interior areas are brightly lit by continual flame spells cast on crumbling stone wall sconces.
- Tunnels have 20 -foot-high arched ceilings, and rooms have flat 25 -foot-high ceilings, unless otherwise noted. Staircases are carved out of solid rock and are 30 feet high and 30 feet long. Walls and ceilings are roughly hewn, and floors are smooth.
- The asteroid magically generates breathable air that fills Stardock's interior and extends out 120 feet from the asteroid. Beyond this range is the airless void of space. A creature can survive in space for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum 1 round) before it dies.
- The temperature inside the asteroid's air envelope is 70 degrees Fahrenheit unless otherwise noted.
- An invisible gravity plane cuts through the asteroid along its equator, as illustrated in the Side View of the asteroid on map 16. Creatures and objects inside the asteroid's air envelope fall toward this gravity plane. Creatures and objects inside the asteroid fall toward the floor, as normal.
- There are no cardinal directions (north, south, east, or west) in Stardock or in space, and compasses don't function here.
Creatures can propel themselves through space using magic such as fly spells, but wings and other nonmagical means of propulsion are useless in the frictionless void.


## 12. Dragons' Domain

Ashtyrranthor and her six children make their home here. Magic keeps the temperature at 120 degrees Fahrenheit throughout these chambers, making it perfect for the dragons' comfort. Characters who stay in this area for more than 1 hour suffer the effects of extreme heat (see chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).

## 12a. Arch Gate

Ceiling. This room has a 30 -foot-high, domed ceiling. Scales. The floor is littered with red dragon scales. Gate to the Crystal Labyrinth. A stone arch set with glowing red crystals is embedded in the back wall of an alcove.
Pedestal. Rising from the floor 10 feet in front of the arch is a 3 -foot-high pedestal made of red crystal with a small hole in the top.
Inserting a Stardock rod (see the "Stardock Rods," sidebar) into the hole in the pedestal creates an open doorway inside the arch that leads to area 11. The pedestal and archway are otherwise identical to those in area 11.
Any character who examines the scales and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) check realizes that the scales came from multiple owners. Most were shed by an adult red dragon, while a few were cast off by one or more young red dragons.

## 12b. Tiamat Shrine

Tapestries. Two beautiful tapestries hang on the walls. Carving. Carved into the floor is a stylized, 15 -foot-diameter disk-shaped engraving of Tiamat, her five chromatic dragon heads spewing their breath weapons.
One tapestry depicts Tiamat combating twelve storm giants. The other shows Tiamat battling a bearded and bloodied old man in wizard robes with seven golden canaries circling his head. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Religion) check recognizes the old man as a representation of Bahamut, the god of good dragons, in human form, and the seven canaries as his polymorphed gold dragon advisors.
Treasure. Each tapestry is 20 feet on a side, weighs 25 pounds, and is worth 750 gp intact.

## 12c. False Hatchery

Lava Curtain. A 30 -foot-wide curtain of lava along one wall drains into a pool 1 foot deep, 30 feet long, and 10 feet wide. A secret door stands behind the lava curtain, opening into area 12d. The characters can't open or pass through the secret door without coming into contact with the lava.
Eggs. Six red-speckled dragon eggs sit in the lava pool.
The lava curtain is created magically but is not itself magical. A creature that enters the lava for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 55 (10d10) fire damage.

Each egg is 4 feet tall, hollow, and 500 pounds. A character who inspects the eggs closely and succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check realizes that they are fakes made of polished stone.

---

## 12d. Dragon Hatchery

Lava Pool. The entire floor is a 1 -foot-deep pool of lava. The lava is created magically but is not itself magical. A creature that enters the lava floor for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 55 (10d10) fire damage.
Egg. A red-speckled dragon egg rests in the lava near the chamber's curved wall.

The red dragon egg stands 4 feet high and weighs 250 pounds. To properly develop, the egg must spend another six months in an environment of extreme heat. When the egg hatches, a red dragon wyrmling emerges. The wyrmling is loyal to no one except itself. If the characters steal the egg, Ashtyrranthor and every other dragon of her line will hunt the characters until the egg is recovered.

## 12e. False Hoard

Loud noises in this area alert the denizens of areas 12 f and 13 , who remain where they are but can't be surprised.
Illusion. A 20 -foot-wide, 4 -foot-high pile of coins, jewels, and art objects lies on the floor in the 20 -foot-square area marked on map 16. The treasure pile is an illusion that can be dispelled (DC 16). A detect magic spell reveals its illusory nature. The treasure has no substance, so any physical interaction with the pile also reveals that it's an illusion.
Scales. The floor around the treasure pile is littered with cast-off red dragon scales.
Statues. Two 20 -foot-tall, gilded statues of dragons of an unknown type stand along one wall.
Characters who examine the scales can tell that they came from a red dragon. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) check realizes that the scales came from multiple dragons. Most were shed by an adult red dragon, while a few were cast off by one or more young red dragons.
The ancient statues testify to the unknown draconic creators of this chamber. They are impervious to damage, which prevents any of their gold leaf from being removed.

## 12f. Dragons' Hoard

The characters hear the strumming of a lute (see area 13) as they approach this rough-hewn cave, the contents of which are as follows:
Hoard. An enormous pile of coins and gems fills this chamber. Sleeping under this hoard are two male young red dragons named Blazutranc and Meteoranzym.
Tunnel. A wide tunnel strewn with cast-off red dragon scales breaks through the outer shell of the asteroid and forms a ledge overlooking the planet Toril.
Blazutranc and Meteoranzym are slumbering beneath the treasure pile. Characters who approach quietly and succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check spot the gleaming red scales of the dragons beneath the treasure. When they become aware of intruders, the dragons fight until one of them is reduced to 60 hit
points, whereupon they both leave the asteroid in search of their mother, Ashtyrranthor.
Treasure. The hoard consists of $249,280 \mathrm{cp}, 121,472$ sp, 11,302 ep, 6,025 gp, 200 pp, two ambers ( 100 gp each), four coral branches ( 250 gp each), two spinels ( 100 gp each), three bloodstones ( 50 gp each), five hematites ( 10 gp each), an old painting of a dwarf miner ( 25 gp ), and a bear mask made of jade ( 250 gp ).

## 13. Jerath's Quarters

Characters who heard the strumming lute in area 12 f can follow the music to this chamber, which contains the following:
Jerath. Jerath, a blinded githyanki knight with no eyes or armor (AC 12), sits in a chair strumming a lute. His greatsword leans against a wall within easy reach.
Furnishings. A lavish wood-framed bed stands near the wall across from four 2 -foot-high, 6 -inch-wide window slits. By peering through the slits, one can see the starry void of space beyond.
Jerath lost his eyes in a battle against the ulitharid on display in area 9. He saved Ashtyrranthor's life when she was a wyrmling, and she has cared for him since his injury. Characters who speak Gith and succeed on a DC 12 Charisma (Deception) check can convince Jerath that they are githyanki. Jerath shares any information he knows with fellow githyanki, including the layout of Stardock, the unhappiness of the young dragon Infernexus, and Al'chaia's cruelty.
If Jerath believes the characters are not githyanki, he tries to keep them in this area with conversation or a song. He knows that Ashtyrranthor crawls by the window slits once every 10 minutes to check on him. If she sees or smells intruders in Jerath's presence, she storms into area 12 f , makes her way here, and dispatches them.

## 14. Infernexus's Quarters

The unhappiest of Ashtyrranthor's brood, a male young red dragon named Infernexus, claims this chamber as his lair. The dragon sleeps across from the door underneath four 2 -foot-high, 6 -inch-wide window slits that peer into the starry void.
Ashtyrranthor's youngest child is miserable on Stardock. He is eager to leave the asteroid and begin life on his own, but his mother insists he help the githyanki. So he spends most of his time here, sleeping or darkly staring out into space.
If the characters do not attack him at once, Infernexus proposes a deal. He helps them achieve their goals in the asteroid if they promise to kill his mother and help him carve out a lair for himself in Undermountain. He's very particular and doesn't consider any lair other than the Twisted Caverns (level 4) suitable. If a deal is struck, Infernexus becomes the characters' loyal companion for 1 d 10 days. But if they haven't gotten the dragon to the Twisted Caverns by then, he betrays them.
If the characters attack Infernexus or refuse his deal, he fights until reduced to 100 hit points or fewer. He then screams for his mother, who hears the call and arrives at the window slits $1 \mathrm{~d} 4+1$ rounds later.

---

## 15. Githyanki Trainees

Githyanki children are brought to the crèche to grow, train, and study in these connected caverns.

## 15a. Training Area

If the characters make any loud noise here, the githyanki knight in area 15b investigates. This cavern has the following features:
Straw Dummies. Straw dummies crafted to resemble mind flayers stand near the center of the chamber.
Apparatus. A large climbing apparatus made of black steel is mounted to one wall.
Inscriptions. Gith inscriptions cover the remaining walls. (They recount crimes perpetrated by the githzerai and the mind flayers against the githyanki.)
The straw dummies are used for combat practice. Each is a Medium object with AC 10, 10 hit points, immunity to poison and psychic damage, and vulnerability to fire damage.

## 15b. Tutor's Quarters

A male githyanki knight named Kaaltav dwells in this area. If not already alerted, the knight sleeps in a canopied four-poster and wakes at any loud noise. If he is alerted, the knight moves to area 15a to keep intruders from harming the children in area 15 c .
Treasure. Kaaltav's plate armor is set with six zircons ( 50 gp each) and six violet garnets ( 100 gp each).

## 15c. Githyanki Quarters

Twenty githyanki children (noncombatants) sleep in small stone-framed beds in this room. Any movement in the room wakes 1d6 of them, who see the characters and shout out in alarm. The githyanki knight in area 15b arrives 1 round later as the other young awake. While the knight fights the characters, the githyanki young run throughout the crèche and raise the alarm.

## 16. Nursery

Infant githyanki are brought to the crèche shortly after birth and raised in this nursery until they are old enough to undertake their training.

## 16a. Sleeping Area

Children. Forty githyanki infants (noncombatants) sleep in crystal cradles arranged in five rows of eight.
Window Slits. Four 2-foot-long, 6-inch-wide window slits reveal the starry void of space beyond.
A creature moving through this chamber must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Stealth) check to avoid waking the sleeping infants. On a failed check, or if any loud noise occurs in this area, the infant githyanki wake and begin to cry. Both githyanki knights in area 16b investigate quickly.
Ashtyrranthor crawls by the window slits once every 10 minutes to check on the area. If she sees intruders here but the infant githyanki appear safe, she holds off attacking for fear of harming them. As soon as the intruders move into another area of Stardock, the dragon uses her magic or her burrowing speed to enter the asteroid and attack them.

## 16b. Nursery Guardians

Two githyanki knights, a male named Ir'rigo and a female named Kritinaya, sleep in wooden beds against the walls. Any loud noise wakes the knights, who fight to the death against intruders.
Treasure. Ir'rigo's plate armor is set with six orange carnelians ( 50 gp each) and six amethysts ( 100 gp each). Kritinaya's plate armor is set with eight lapis lazuli gemstones ( 50 gp each) and two blue spinels ( 500 gp each).

## 17. War Wizards

Gish live and train in this section of Crèche K'liir.

## 17a. Gish Study

Furnishings. Six cushioned chairs form a circle around a brazier of purple fire at the center of the room.
Gish. A female githyanki gish (see appendix A) named Vheza sits in one chair, reading a tome.
If Vheza sees intruders, she flees to area 17b with her book and makes her stand there.
Treasure. The book that Vheza is reading is written in Gith and titled The Ascension of Vlaakith. It chronicles Vlaakith the Lich-Queen's rise to power in githyanki society and postulates that her absolute rulership would have been impossible had she not mastered arcane magic. The book also discusses the importance of wizardry as a githyanki tool for defeating their enemies and conquering the multiverse. The tome is worth 50 gp .

## 17b. Gish Quarters

Beds. Six beds framed in white metal stand in a row down the center of the rough-walled room.
Gish. Two female githyanki gish (see appendix A) named Evir and Hraznin sit on beds and debate the finer points of magic. Each gish uses a crystal orb as an arcane focus and fights to the death.
Window Slits. Four 2-foot-long, 6-inch-wide window slits offer views of stars, the planet Toril, and the occasional spectacular sunrise.

## 17c. Arcane Training Ground

The scorched remains of straw dummies crafted to resemble illithids are scattered around this rough-walled octagonal room. Burn marks from spell training cover the walls, floor, and ceiling.

## 18. Library

The githyanki keep a modest library of books and maps on shelves carved into the asteroid's rock walls. These shelves run from the floor to the 15 -foot-high ceiling of each chamber. Most githyanki use mage hand to reach higher shelves, but a character can climb a shelf with a successful DC 12 Strength (Athletics) check.

## 18a. Book Collections

The walls of this cavern and the two columns that support the roof are lined with books. All the volumes here are in Gith and concern the githyanki's history battling illithids and githzerai (see the "Gith" entry in the Monster Manual).

---

## 18b. Map Room

The shelves along the walls of this cavern are piled high with leather and bone tubes holding maps of planar locations and small, unnamed dungeons. A character who searches through the maps for 1 hour and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check discovers a recently updated map of Stardock, though none of the asteroid's rooms are labeled.

## 18c. Reading Room

Two cushioned chairs in this rough-walled room face 2 -foot-long, 6 -inch-wide window slits through which can be seen the void of space.

## 19. WAREHOUSE

Food, water, and other supplies for the inhabitants of the crèche are stored here.

## 19a. Loading Dock

Warriors. Four githyanki warriors are organizing crates and setting aside food for the kitchen. They attack in response to any threat or suspicious activity. If two githyanki fall, the survivors retreat to area 21.
Containers. Stacked about the room are forty crates filled with nonperishable food and forty barrels of fresh water.
Beams. Two thick wooden beams lean against the wall between sets of double doors.
The food crates are each 2 feet on a side and weigh 50 pounds. The water barrels are 4 feet tall and weigh 500 pounds each. As an action, a creature can attempt a DC 22 Strength check to push over a stack of crates or barrels. A successful check triggers a domino effect, causing all the stacks to fall. Each creature on the floor of the room when the stacks topple must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 11 (2d10) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone.
The beams can be used to bar the double doors from the inside-a defensive measure in case the asteroid is attacked by spacefaring creatures. Each beam is 8 feet long and weighs 250 pounds. Once the double doors are barred shut, only a siege engine or a creature that has the Siege Monster trait can force them open.

## 19b. Cold Storage

This area extends under area 18b, as indicated on the map. A magic ward keeps the temperature in this area at 10 degrees Fahrenheit. Characters who stay in this area for more than 1 hour suffer the effects of extreme cold (see chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).
The githyanki keep twelve crates here, filled with fresh produce and meat and stacked in two rows of six. Each crate is 2 feet on a side and weighs 50 pounds.
The foodstuffs come from distant worlds and are unfamiliar to most of Toril's population. Labels written in Gith reveal some of the crates' more savory contents, such as infinity vine stalks, H'cathan doom radishes, aartuk tongues, giant space hamster hocks, dried mortiss meat, pickled jammer leeches, and puffer steaks.

## 20. Dock

This stone dock was carved out of the asteroid. Despite its incalculable age, it's sturdy and safe. Because the dock is built along the asteroid's gravity plane, creatures can stand on its underside as easily as atop it. The experience of standing on the topside or underside of the dock can be disorienting, however, what with the planet Toril looming large below the asteroid.
The air around the dock is no different from the air in the asteroid, and the temperature here is 70 degrees Fahrenheit. These things cease to be true when one leaves the asteroid's air envelope, where the inhospitable vacuum of space awaits.

## Ashtyrranthor Attacks!

The adult red dragon Ashtyrranthor patrols the outside of the asteroid, staying inside its air envelope. If the characters stay on the dock for more than 10 minutes or make any loud noise while in this area, Ashtyrranthor notices them and swoops in for the kill.

## Ship Arrivals

Spacefaring vessels dock here to bring in supplies for the inhabitants of Stardock. There are no ships at the dock while the characters are on the asteroid.

If you want to expand the characters' adventures to their widest possible extent, a githyanki astral ship or a spelljamming vessel could arrive while the characters are exploring Stardock. Where such a ship would go next is up to you.

## 21. Warrior Quarters

Githyanki warriors live and train in this area.

## 21a. Guard Post

A male githyanki knight named Raajna and his mount, a female young red dragon named Smoakcant, are on duty here. They keep the warriors in line and defend the nursery (area 16). If they are not alerted to the characters' approach, the two are talking in Draconic, discussing how to best torture new mind flayer prisoners. The githyanki and the dragon fight intruders to the death.

Treasure. Raajna's plate armor is set with six red spinels ( 100 gp each) and two peridots ( 500 gp each).

## 21b. Warriors' Quarters

This area extends under area 22, as indicated on map 16. The rough-walled chamber contains the following:

Warriors. Ten githyanki warriors (five females and five males) reside here. If they have not been alerted, half of the githyanki are asleep when the characters arrive. The others are playing Dragonchess and talking in their native language.
Furnishings. Fifteen wooden bunk beds are arranged in three rows of five in the narrower portion of the room. Six round tables, each encircled by five chairs, stand in the wider area.
Secret Trapdoor. A secret trapdoor in the 30 -foot-high ceiling leads to area 22 . The trapdoor is a 3 -footsquare stone slab that requires a successful DC 13 Strength (Athletics) check to lift.

---

The githyanki fight intruders until six or more of them fall. The remaining warriors then retreat to area 27 . The githyanki knight and the red dragon in area 21a investigate any combat or other disturbance in this area.

Treasure. There are five Dragonchess sets here. Each set has transparent crystal pieces and is worth 250 gp .

## 22. Al'chaia's Quarters

Al'chaia commands the githyanki forces in the Crystal Labyrinth and Crèche K'liir. This room serves as her quarters. The chamber's contents are as follows:
Al'chaia. Al'chaia, a githyanki knight with 140 hit points, stands at a 5 -foot-diameter round table in the center of the room, poring over reports written in Gith that document recent clashes with the mind flayers on level 17.
Dragon. Zolcharrx, a female young red dragon, is curled up in a corner of the room, watching Al'chaia wearily.
Furnishings. A huge, well-carved canopy bed standing against one wall has a small, shiny, black metal chest next to it (see "Treasure" below). Mounted on other walls are thirteen stuffed mind flayer heads.
Secret Trapdoor. A secret trapdoor in the floor under the table opens into the ceiling of area 21b. The trapdoor is a 3 -foot-square stone slab that requires a successful DC 13 Strength (Athletics) check to lift.
The characters can avoid a fight here if they quickly inform Al'chaia, in Draconic or Gith, that Urlon (see area 10) wants her dead. Al'chaia thanks them for the information. She then promises the characters safe passage back to and through the Crystal Labyrinth, provided they leave Crèche K'liir as soon as they complete "one small task" for her.
If the characters are reluctant to accept her terms, Al'chaia offers them a manual of gainful exercise or a tome of clear thought if they can get more information out of her githzerai prisoner, Ezria. Specifically, she wants to know why he's in Undermountain and how many other githzerai are with him. A successful DC 19 Wisdom (Insight) check reveals that Al'chaia has no intention of upholding her end of any deal.
If the characters agree to question Ezria, Al'chaia and Zolcharrx escort them to the prison (area 29b) to meet the prisoner. If the characters obtain the information Al'chaia requested, she and Zolcharrx usher characters from the prison to area 20, where Al'chaia pretends the books are located. She then shouts for Ashtyrranthor before she and Zolcharrx attack. Ashtyrranthor joins the fight $1 d 4+1$ rounds later.
Al'chaia fights until reduced to 90 hit points or fewer, then flees. Zolcharrx, ever loyal, fights to the death to cover Al'chaia's escape.
Characters who understand the Gith language can translate the battle reports in Al'chaia's custody with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Doing so reveals how many githyanki are currently stationed on level 17 of Undermountain, as well as the names of the githyanki leaders on that level.

## Treasure

Al'chaia's plate armor is set with eight black jaspers ( 50 gp each), eight red tourmalines ( 100 gp each), and four topazes ( 500 gp each).
The chest is locked. Al'chaia hides the key to the chest in the sphincter-like maw of the stuffed mind flayer head closest to the chest. A successful DC 25 Dexterity check using thieves' tools picks the lock, and a successful DC 30 Strength (Athletics) check forces the chest open. A knock spell or similar magic also opens it. The chest is a Small object with AC 19, 22 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. It contains 900 gp , a manual of gainful exercise, a tome of clear thought, and a Stardock rod (see "Stardock Rods," page 214).

## 23. Observation Room

This unoccupied room has four 2 -foot-long, 6 -inchwide window slits that reveal starry space beyond. The githyanki observe incoming vessels from here.
A secret trapdoor in the floor opens into the ceiling of area 24. From here, it's a 30 -foot drop to the floor of that chamber. The trapdoor is a 3 -foot-square stone slab that can be lifted with a singular or combined Strength of 15 or higher.

## 24. Knights' Quarters

This area extends under area 23, as indicated on map 16. This chamber contains the following:

Knights. Two male githyanki knights named Kr'rison and Vlaadric are engaged in an argument that's on the verge of coming to blows.
Beds. Four stone-framed beds line the south wall.
Secret Trapdoor. A secret trapdoor in the 30 -foot-high ceiling leads to area 23 . The trapdoor is a 3 -footsquare stone slab that requires a successful DC 13 Strength (Athletics) check to lift.
If the characters get close to this area without alerting the githyanki, they hear the two arguing in Gith about which one of them deserves "Al'chaia's magic books." If attacked, Kr'rison and Vlaadric fight together until one falls. The other then retreats to area 27.

## Treasure

Kr'rison's plate armor is set with six red-brown carnelians ( 50 gp each) and four ambers ( 100 gp each). Vlaadric's plate armor is set with eight chalcedonies ( 50 gp each) and two aquamarines ( 500 gp each).

## 25. Memorial Hall

The names of githyanki who died hunting illithids on Toril are carved in neat rows on the walls of this chamber. The longest wall is dominated by a relief carving of a githyanki soldier battling three mind flayers.

## 26. Kitchen

The characters hear a lot of clatter as they approach this area, which extends under area 15a (as indicated on map 16). The kitchen contains the following:
Cooks. Four githyanki warriors (two females and two males) prepare a large meal, moving between a pair

---

of roaring iron stoves and a 10 -foot-long table covered with pots, bowls, and cutlery.
Shelves. Shelves carved into the walls hold jars of spices and various other cooking ingredients.
The warriors attack intruders on sight. Combat here brings reinforcements from area 27.

The stoves are piping hot. Any creature that touches a stove for the first time on a turn takes 3 (1d6) fire damage.

## 27. Mess Hall

Furnishings. Six 10 -foot-long tables, each set with eight chairs, stand in neat rows.
Githyanki. Unless they have been drawn elsewhere, five githyanki warriors (three females and two males) and one male githyanki gish (see appendix A) are eating together at a table, talking in low, angry tones.
If the characters get close to this area without alerting its occupants, they hear the githyanki complaining in Gith about Al'chaia's cruelty. The githyanki attack at once in response to any threat, fighting until four or more of them fall. Survivors then flee to area 30 without going through area 29.

## 28. Armory

The githyanki repair and store weapons and armor here.

## 28a. Armor Storage

Ten suits of plate armor and thirty suits of half plate hang on wooden stands throughout the room. The armor is crafted in the baroque style favored by the githyanki, and the suits of plate armor have empty sockets and fittings where gemstones are meant to be set (though none are present in the suits displayed here).

## 28b. Smithy and Weapon Storage

Githyanki. A female githyanki warrior named Salarrl is busy repairing armor at a forge. A wooden trestle table and an iron anvil are arranged nearby.
Weapons. Thirty greatswords hang on weapon racks mounted to the walls.
Salarrl is engrossed in her work. Any character who succeeds on a DC 12 Dexterity (Stealth) check can sneak by her unnoticed. If she detects intruders, Salarrl retreats to area 30.

## 29. Prison

Enemies of the githyanki are imprisoned in this area, which consists of three large cells (areas 29a, 29b, and 29c) and a guard post (area 29d). A separate and permanent antimagic field fills the interior of each cell.

The doors to the cells, which stand outside the range of the antimagic fields, are magically locked. Any creature that carries a Stardock rod (see "Stardock Rods," page 214) can open a cell door, which has no physical locks to be picked. A door can also be opened by a knock spell or similar magic cast outside the cells.

The guards in area 29d know when one of the cell doors is opened and investigate.

## 29a. Empty Cell

The walls of this cell are covered in crudely etched graffiti dating back to a time before the githyanki took over Stardock.

## 29b. Ezria's Cell

Ezria, a githzerai zerth with 32 hit points remaining, is imprisoned here. He lost his left eye years ago in a brawl with a blue slaad. An eye patch covers the loss but does little to hide the nasty scar across his face. He owes his fresh bruises to his githyanki hosts.

Ezria is normally calm and collected. That changes if the characters are accompanied by one or more mind flayers, whereupon Ezria loses his composure and tries to kill the illithids with his bare hands. He doesn't trust anyone who would ally with such creatures.

Ezria was caught spying on the githyanki in the Crystal Labyrinth. They have been torturing him for information, hoping to learn how many other githzerai are nearby. Ezria's will is nigh unbreakable, and he has answered none of the githyanki's questions. Ezria is not of a mind to share this information with the characters, either-at least not until they earn his trust by seeing him safely back to his friends on level 15.

If the characters profess to be enemies of the mind flayers, Ezria tells them that a mind flayer colony has formed in Seadeeps (level 17), and the githyanki are waging war against them. He will gladly accompany the characters if their intention is to wipe out the illithid colony. (As a party member, he's entitled to a full share of XP for defeating monsters.) At the very least, if the characters help Ezria escape, he asks to stay with them until they return to the Crystal Labyrinth. He then departs to rejoin his friends on level 15.

## 29c. Imprisoned Illithids

Tel'zact and Yeluit, two mind flayers from Seadeeps (level 17), are held captive here. Al'chaia is keeping them alive until they can be pitted against her finest githyanki knights in a display of battle prowess for the benefit of the young warriors in training.

If the characters try to engage with Tel'zact and Yeluit, the mind flayers propose a deal. With the aid of their detect thoughts spells, the illithids have learned that Al'chaia keeps a manual of gainful exercise and a tome of clear thought in her quarters. If the characters help the mind flayers escape, the illithids help them search for Al'chaia's quarters (area 22) and claim the books. If an opportunity arises to turn against the characters for personal gain, the freed illithids take advantage of it.

## 29d. Guard Room

Gish. Two female githyanki gish (see appendix A) named Aruut and Yangol stand in the middle of this unfurnished room, speaking to each other in low tones as they watch the cell doors.
Green Crystals. A glowing green crystal is embedded above each cell door.
Characters who get close to the githyanki without alerting them overhear them talking (in Gith) about the mind flayer prisoners in area 29c. Aruut and Yangol are

---

looking forward to the prisoners' executions. If a fight breaks out here, the githyanki in area 30 investigate.

A detect magic spell reveals an aura of divination magic around each green crystal. Whenever a cell door is opened, the crystal above the doorway to that cell goes dark until the door closes. This is true regardless of which of a cell's two doors is opened. When Aruut and Yangol see a crystal go dark, they enter the cell to make sure nothing is amiss.

Treasure. Each githyanki gish carries a Stardock rod (see "Stardock Rods," page 214).

## 30. Warrior Training

This area extends under area 31, as indicated on map 16. Characters who listen at a door to this room before entering hear a female voice barking commands in Gith and the sound of warriors in training. The chamber contains the following:
Githyanki. A female githyanki knight named Saziq leads six githyanki warriors (three females and three males) in weapon drills.
Training Equipment. Thirty straw dummies shaped like illithids are arranged throughout the cavern. Racks of ropes and weights line the walls.
Secret Trapdoor. A secret trapdoor in the 30 -foot-high ceiling leads to area 31 . The trapdoor is a 3 -footsquare stone slab that requires a successful DC 13 Strength (Athletics) check to push open.
If combat breaks out here, the githyanki gish in area 29d come to investigate. The githyanki attack anyone they perceive as an intruder and fight until five of their number fall, after which the rest retreat to area 21 b .

The straw dummies are used for combat practice. Each is a Medium object with AC 10, 10 hit points, immunity to poison and psychic damage, and vulnerability to fire damage.

## Treasure

Saziq's plate armor is set with eight red-brown carnelians ( 50 gp each) and four deep green spinels ( 100 gp each). She also wears a plumed helm encrusted with eight citrines ( 50 gp each).

## 31. Observation Room

This room is devoid of furnishings and occupants. Four 2 -foot-long, 6 -inch-wide window slits look out toward the starry void of space.

A secret trapdoor in the floor opens into the ceiling of area 30. The trapdoor is a 3 -foot-square stone slab that requires a successful DC 13 Strength (Athletics) check to lift.

## 32. Graduation Chamber

Githyanki who attain the rank of warrior by hunting down and killing their first mind flayer are celebrated here. This cavern is also used for demonstrations of githyanki battle prowess, during which prisoners are executed by githyanki knights while young warriors cheer.

This cavern has the following features:

Scrying Eye. When the characters enter this area for the first time, they see one of Halaster's scrying eyes floating in the middle of the cavern (see "Halaster's Lair," page 311). It studies the characters for a minute or two before disappearing.
Blood. The floor is stained with pools of dry blood.
Altar. An 8 -foot-high, rune-etched stone altar is situated in an alcove. It's topped with a life-size statue of a dag-ger-wielding githyanki warrior slaying a mind flayer.
The engravings on the altar, written in Gith, tell the story of how the githyanki freed themselves from the yoke of their illithid masters, shattered the mind flayer empires across the multiverse, and carved out their own kingdom on the Astral Plane under the rulership of Vlaakith the Lich-Queen. The altar conveniently omits any mention of the githzerai, but specific mention is made of Gith, the githyanki champion who led her people to freedom, and the sacrifices she made to ensure the future of her people. The statue atop the altar depicts Gith slaying an illithid oppressor to win her own freedom.

## Aftermath

If the party defeats Al'chaia and leaves Urlon in charge, the Crystal Labyrinth and Stardock remain largely unchanged in the short term. Fearing that his betrayal of Al'chaia might become known, Urlon orders his warriors to kill the characters if they ever cross paths with the githyanki again.
If the characters wipe out the githyanki and the red dragons, the mind flayers from level 17 are quick to take over the Crystal Labyrinth. If they acquire a Stardock rod, the illithids conquer the asteroid as well, hoping to commandeer the next astral vessel or spelljammer ship that comes to Stardock and invade new worlds.
The characters can secure Stardock as a base once the githyanki, dragons, and mind flayers are no longer threats. The asteroid is a quiet place most of the time, far removed from the perils and politics of Toril. The peace is interrupted every month or so by the arrival of a spelljamming vessel bearing provisions gathered from far-flung worlds. Such a vessel might be crewed by githyanki, gnomes, or some other spacefaring race.
About once a year, a githyanki-crewed astral ship delivers young githyanki to the crèche. A githyanki astral ship doesn't travel through space but rather shifts in and out of the Astral Plane, appearing literally out of nowhere next to the asteroid's dock and disappearing back into the silvery void once its delivery is complete. If the githyanki discover that Crèche K'liir has fallen, they retreat to the Astral Plane and return in short order with an overwhelming force to recapture the asteroid.
Halaster cares more about the Crystal Labyrinth than he does about Stardock. Suddenly unhappy with the "renovations" the githyanki have made, the Mad Mage might assert his control over the labyrinth and reshape it to suit his whims.

EADEEPS IS DESIGNED FOR FOUR 14TH-LEVEL characters, and adventurers who defeat the monsters on this level should gain enough XP to advance to 15 th level. Before running this level, consider reviewing the "Gith" and "Mind Flayer" entries in the Monster Manual, as well as the "Ulitharid" entry in appendix A. They will help you roleplay the monsters on this level and bring their conflict in Seadeeps to life.

## What Dwells Here?

Mind flayers from the Underdark have formed a new colony on this level of Undermountain, though githyanki from level 16 are determined to wipe it out.

## Mind Flayers

Deep in the Underdark, a githyanki vanguard force attacked a large colony of mind flayers controlled by an elder brain. Fearing the colony's destruction, the elder brain instructed its most loyal vassal, an ulitharid called Extremiton, to establish a splinter colony somewhere safe from githyanki incursions. Extremiton made its way to Undermountain with a group of mind flayers, laid claim to level 17 of the dungeon, and began fortifying it against attacks from the githyanki and others. The dungeon's proximity to Waterdeep guaranteed the mind flayers a limitless supply of brains to feed on, while Undermountain's existing defenses offered an unprecedented level of security.

## Enemies at the Gates

Through methods unknown to the illithids, the githyanki vanguard force tracked the survivors of their attack on the colony to Undermountain. Having recently secured the nearby Crystal Labyrinth (level 16), the githyanki now wage war against the mind flayers in Seadeeps. Uncertainty about its own future has forced Extremiton to hold off on transforming into an elder brain. Instead, it is focused on defending the colony and destroying its githyanki neighbors. With only a dozen mind flayers remaining under its rule, Extremiton has resorted to breeding a neothelid (see appendix A) and plans to set it loose in the Crystal Labyrinth to finally wipe out the githyanki force. Extremiton is also gathering thralls of every race to help defend the colony if the neothelid is destroyed or fails in its task.

## City of the Mind

Extremiton can sense intelligent creatures within 2 miles of it and is able to communicate with them telepathically. Using this ability judiciously, the ulitharid has learned a great deal about the city above and its inhabitants. Waterdeep has, in a way, captured the ulitharid's imagination.

Extremiton intends to enslave the population of Waterdeep, but not before it fully understands this strange city and its people. The telepathic communications the ulitharid has initiated with random Waterdavians has provided it with plenty of information, but no firsthand knowledge of how city dwellers behave and react on a daily basis.

---

## Qualith Door Locks

Mounted on both sides of every door in the mind flayer colony (areas 9 through 20) is a burnished plate of dark, alien metal embossed with a braille-like form of tactile writing known as Qualith. Mind flayers use their tentacles to read Qualith, which is composed in four-line stanzas indecipherable to other creatures. A creature that touches a Qualith inscription, however, can receive fragmentary insight into the multilayered thoughts contained in it. A non-illithid that wants to understand a Qualith inscription in Seadeeps can make a DC 18 Intelligence check to interpret the inscription. A failed attempt results in a crushing headache and requires the creature to succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or develop a random form of short-term madness (see "Madness" in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master's Guide). A comprehend languages spell provides understanding of the inscription roughly equivalent to what a mind flayer would get from it.
Each door plate is imbued with psionic energy that functions like an arcane lock spell. The Qualith inscription on the plate describes the genuflections a mind flayer must make with its tentacles to open the door. Other creatures with at least four tentacles (such as flumphs) can imitate these motions to bypass the lock, provided they can interpret the inscription. A creature must be within 5 feet of the door to open it in this way. Creatures without the requisite tentacles and knowledge must deal with the lock by more conventional means, such as a knock spell. If magic is unavailable, a locked door can be forced open with a successful DC 30 Strength (Athletics) check.
Clever adventurers might discover that a decapitated mind flayer head, animated through an animate dead spell, can be used to access the locks.

In the heart of Seadeeps, the ulitharid has built an enormous dynamo that channels the energy of an underground river to power a series of interconnected metal capsules called psipods. The illithids under Extremiton's command have kidnapped humanoids from Waterdeep and Undermountain and put them to sleep in these capsules, which link their dreaming minds to the ulitharid's dizzying intellect. These captives believe they're in Waterdeep, but the city they see and experience around them is a fabrication created wholly by the ulitharid. Within this alternate reality Waterdeep, or "Alterdeep," Extremiton appears as any character it wants. Its favorite role to play is that of Durnan, the gruff, tight-lipped proprietor of the Yawning Portal.
Extremiton can make any environmental changes to Alterdeep and observe how its captive audience reacts. Meanwhile, it continues to use its telepathy to reach out to the Waterdavians in the city above, gathering more information to better realize its version of the city.

## Githyanki

After tracking the splinter colony of mind flayers to Undermountain, githyanki forces from level 16 have begun their systematic eradication of the illithid presence.
The githyanki forces on this level await reinforcements from level 16. Yaveklar, the knight in command, intends to personally cut off the ulitharid's head and present it to her superiors. Her second in command, Lashiir, wants to see Yaveklar stripped of her command for incompetence.

## Exploring This Level

All location descriptions for this level are keyed to map 17.
The caverns surrounding the mind flayer colony are dark and damp. The space occupied by the colony is smoothly carved from solid stone. Throughout this level, adventurers hear the constant thunder of the underground river, which is especially loud in area 12 and slightly less so in areas 16 through 20.

## 1. Tunnel Plexus

The natural tunnel that descends from level 16 levels out before splitting into several passages that connect to areas 2,5 , and 6 . These passageways have uneven floors and ceilings, the distance between which varies from 10 to 15 feet. Characters who navigate these tunnels occasionally come across the bodies of flumphs slain by the githyanki.

## 2. Dripping Cave

Water drips from stalactites that cling to the roof of this damp, 30 -foot-high cave.

## 3. Halaster's Maw

Most of this 30 -foot-high cavern is taken up by a gaping pit roughly 50 feet long, 30 feet wide, and 30 feet deep. Its sides slope inward so that the floor of the pit is 30 feet long by 10 feet wide. A statue of a humanoid figure lies shattered at the bottom of the pit.
The broken statue is all that remains of Aasathra Raghthroknaar, a female dragonborn adventurer who was turned to stone and placed here by Halaster to lure other adventurers to their doom (see "Pit Trap" below).

## Pit Trap

A detect magic spell reveals an aura of transmutation magic around the pit. Each time part of the statue is disturbed, the pit magically snaps shut like a giant mouth and then slowly opens again. Creatures in the pit when it closes are crushed between its rocky walls and must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 88 (16d10) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures that are gaseous, amorphous (such as an ooze), or protected by an impenetrable magical barrier (such as that created by an Otiluke's resilient sphere spell) take no damage.

## 4. Flumph Cloister

Flumphs. Stalactites cling to the roof of this 20 -foothigh cavern. Lurking among them are nine flumphs. The flumphs are passive creatures that fight only in self-defense.
Secret Door. A secret door in the south wall is carved to resemble natural stone.
The flumphs telepathically share the following information with friendly visitors:

- Mind flayers have established a splinter colony on this level (areas 9 through 20). An ulitharid called Extremiton leads the colony. Once the colony is secure and its

enemies are eradicated, Extremiton will undergo a transformation ritual to become an elder brain.

- Githyanki want to destroy the illithid colony and any flumphs they encounter. The mind flayers have spawned a neothelid-a worm-like behemoth-to defend their colony and destroy their githyanki enemies. Right now, the neothelid is trapped behind several wall of force spells (in area 8).
- The mind flayers have captured many humanoids from Waterdeep and Undermountain, most of whom are kept as "cattle." The rest are turned into mindless thralls in service to Extremiton.
The flumphs don't need to enter the mind flayer colony to feed on the illithids' immense psionic energy. This cave is close enough to the colony that the flumphs can nourish themselves from a safe distance.
The flumphs are aware of the secret door but reluctant to speak of it, since they have come to rely on the illithid colony for sustenance. The flumphs would rather feed on the psionic energy of the mind flayers, who couldn't care less, than the energy of the githyanki, who abhor the flumphs and attack them on sight.


## 5. Githyanki Grave

Seepage. Water seeps into this 30 -foot-high cave through minuscule cracks in the ceiling, flowing in rivulets down the walls and disappearing through natural drains in the floor.
Corpses. Lying in alcoves to the east are the corpses of ten githyanki who perished fighting the mind flayers and their thralls.

## 6. Battleground

This area has become the main battleground in the conflict between the githyanki and the mind flayers. The ceilings throughout are 20 feet high.

## 6a. Cave of Carnage

Corpses. The uneven floor is strewn with the corpses of githyanki, troglodytes, duergar, ogres, and orogs, as well as eight decapitated mind flayers and two flumphs.
Githyanki. Four githyanki warriors with nondetection spells cast on them lurk behind rock formations in the middle of the cavern.
The githyanki report to the knights in area 7c. Three fight to the death to defend the cavern, while the fourth retreats to area 7 a to alert their allies.

## 6b. Severed Heads

Double Door. Embedded in the east wall is a stone double door sealed with Qualith door locks (see "Qualith Door Locks," page 222). Unless it is held open, the door automatically closes and locks.
Heads on Pikes. Seven decapitated mind flayer heads with limp tentacles are mounted on pikes in the middle of the cavern, facing the double door. (They were left here by the githyanki.)

## 6c. One Brave Flumph

A flumph lurks in the shadows of this alcove, surreptitiously feeding on the psionic energy of the githyanki warriors in area 6a. A successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check is required to detect the creature. The flumph has the same helpful disposition and information as the rest of its kin on this level (see area 4).

## 7. Githyanki Stronghold

Two githyanki knights and eight githyanki warriors are stationed here. These githyanki are alert and won't give up their stronghold without a fight. Yaveklar, the knight in command, carries a potion of supreme healing, which she uses if she becomes grievously wounded.

## 7A. Arch Gate to Level 15

Light. Torches burn in iron brackets mounted to four pillars that support the 20 -foot-high ceiling.
Githyanki. Four githyanki warriors stand guard next to the pillars.
Arch. Embedded in the east wall is a stone arch, its keystone carved with an image of a six-fingered gauntlet.
The githyanki warriors follow orders without question and have no authority to negotiate; that task falls to the knights in area 7c. A fight here brings reinforcements from areas 7 b and 7 c .
Arch Gate. The arch is one of Halaster's magic gates (see "Gates," page 12). Its rules are as follows:

- The gate opens for 1 minute if a creature touches the arch with a six-fingered gauntlet. (Such an item can be found on level 15.)
- Characters must be 13th level or higher to pass through this gate (see "Jhesiyra Kestellharp," page 10). The first creature to pass through the gate triggers an elder rune (see "Elder Runes," page 12).
- A creature that passes through the gate appears in area 24 c on level 15 , in the closest unoccupied space next to the identical gate located there.


## 7b. Barracks

Light. Resting on the floor are two glass lanterns with continual flame spells cast on them.
Wounded Githyanki. Four githyanki warriors are recovering from wounds inflicted on them by the mind flayers' thralls. Each has 30 hit points remaining.
Fountain. Embedded in the north wall is a stone fountain with a semicircular basin. The fountain is carved in the likeness of a winged fish with water spouting from its mouth.
The githyanki obey the knights in area 7 c and won't accept healing from strangers without their superiors' consent.
The water spouting from the stone fish falls into the semicircular basin beneath it and drains out through small holes inside. The water is cool and clean, and serves the githyanki as a source of fresh water.

## 7c. Knights' Quarters

Light. Resting on the floor is a glass lantern with a continual flame spell cast on it.

---

Knightly Argument. Left undisturbed, two female githyanki knights argue quietly with one another in the middle of the room. One of the knights has a decapitated mind flayer head hanging from her belt.
The older githyanki knight, Yaveklar, commands the githyanki forces on this level. Though she is eager to slay the ulitharid and wipe out the mind flayer colony, Yaveklar is cautious and patient. She has suffered more losses than her superiors would consider acceptable, so she's waiting for reinforcements before launching any further assaults.
The younger knight, Lashiir, stands ready to take over in the event that Yaveklar is removed from command. Lashiir is proposing to attack the neothelid in area 8, using misty step spells to bypass the walls of force containing it. Yaveklar is not convinced that her forces are strong enough to defeat the neothelid and still maintain a foothold on this level.
If the characters can communicate with the knights, they can attempt to forge a truce with the githyanki. Yaveklar orders them to slay the neothelid as proof of their worth. If the characters kill the neothelid but return to Yaveklar in a very weakened state, she takes advantage of their situation and tries to finish them off. If they kill the creature and return with strength to spare, Yaveklar agrees to let them travel through Seadeeps unmolested and will even commit forces to a joint operation to conquer the mind flayer colony. If Yaveklar is neutralized, Lashiir readily fills the power vacuum and behaves much like her predecessor.
The illithid head dangling from Yaveklar's belt is a trophy from a recent skirmish. Resourceful characters can animate the head and use its writhing tentacles to unlock doors equipped with Qualith locks (see "Qualith Door Locks," page 222).
Treasure. Each githyanki knight wears a suit of baroque half plate armor set with three alexandrites ( 500 gp each) and ten citrines ( 50 gp each). In addition, Yaveklar carries a potion of supreme healing.

## 8. Operation: Eat Them All

The mind flayers have spawned a neothelid and trapped it behind magic walls of force controlled from area 16c. The illithids are waiting for Extremiton to give the order to unleash the savage creature on their githyanki enemies in Seadeeps and the Crystal Labyrinth.

## 8A. Neothelid's Cave

Magic walls of force seal off all tunnels leading to this enormous cavern (see "Walls of Force" below). The floor, while uneven throughout, has been worn smooth by the creature trapped here. The cavern has the following features:
Neothelid. A 210 -foot-long neothelid (see appendix A) is curled up in the middle of the cavern, waiting to be fed.
Ceiling. The ceiling is uneven-ranging in height from 60 to 90 feet-and festooned with stalactites.
Ledge. A ledge climbs the western wall to a maximum height of 20 feet. At the back of this ledge are two tunnels leading to area 8 b .

Food in the form of humanoids is delivered to the neothelid through a stone door set into the east wall, beyond which is a smoothly carved tunnel leading to area 16a. The door is sealed with a Qualith lock (see "Qualith Door Locks," page 222).
The neothelid is always hungry and tries to devour any creature that enters its cave. It lacks the intelligence to distinguish one kind of prey from another and feeds indiscriminately.
Tunnel to Expanded Dungeon. If you decide to expand the dungeon southward, the passage in the south wall exists but is sealed off with a wall of force.
Walls of Force. The illithids have a psionic device in area 16 c that generates the magic walls of force sealing off the neothelid's cavern. Each wall is identical to that created by a wall of force spell, with these differences:

- The walls last until the psionic force generator in area 16 c is deactivated.
- A disintegrate spell cast on a wall destroys it for 1 minute, after which the psionic force generator in area 16 c resummons the wall.


## 8в. Standing Gate to Level 19

In the middle of this otherwise empty cave is a pair of standing stones topped with a lintel, carved into which is a symbol of an arrow. The standing stones form a magic gate (see "Gates," page 12). Its rules are as follows:

- If an arrow or a crossbow bolt is shot between the standing stones, the gate opens for 1 minute.
- Characters must be 15th level or higher to pass through this gate (see "Jhesiyra Kestellharp," page 10). The first creature to pass through the gate triggers an elder rune (see "Elder Runes," page 12).
- A creature that passes through the gate appears in area 15 on level 19, in the closest unoccupied space next to the identical gate located there.


## 8c. Dead-End Cave

The tunnel leading to this cave narrows dramatically, but not enough to keep the neothelid from reaching prey that flees here. The cave is empty.

## 9. Guard Post

The doors to this area are made of stone and sealed with Qualith door locks (see "Qualith Door Locks," page 222). Unless they are held open, the doors automatically close and lock. This area has the following features:
Sentries. Two mind flayers stand behind eight orogs (lined up in two rows of four) facing the double door to the west.
Pillars. Two stone pillars with glowing veins of crystal stand to either side of the western hallway.
The mind flayers have orders to thwart any frontal assault on the colony. The orogs are thralls under the illithids' command and defend their alien masters to the death.

---

## 10. Detention Facility

The mind flayers use this detention facility to hold "cat-tle"-the term they use to describe humanoids they consider a food source.
The door to the cell block is made of stone and sealed with a Qualith door lock (see "Qualith Door Locks," page 222). Unless it is held open, the door automatically closes and locks.
The cell block is 10 feet high throughout and contains the following:
Cells. Spaced along the corridor are ten cells with doors made of sturdy iron bars through which a Tiny creature could squeeze. Each cell door is fitted with a Qualith door lock (see "Qualith Door Locks," page 222).
Prisoners. Three prisoners are locked in separate cells when the characters arrive: a foul-smelling troglodyte, a young male human veteran wearing the uniform of a City Watch constable of Waterdeep, and an elderly female grimlock in a soiled gray robe.
The three prisoners subsist on a slimy but nutritious gray mold delivered to them in bowls once a day by illithid thralls.
The troglodyte, Glorz, has a dinner date with the neothelid in area 8 and, given its chaotic evil alignment, can't be trusted to behave itself if set loose.
The City Watch constable, Ishan Toru (LG male Kozakuran human), waits to have his brain devoured by the illithids. Toru's weapons were taken from him and discarded, and he plans to meet his death with whatever courage he can muster. He remembers being lured into an alley by a young girl who claimed her father was being accosted by ruffians. Toru was knocked unconscious by an unseen foe in the alley and awoke in this cell. If set free, he joins forces with his liberators and helps them in any way he can, but is eager to report to his superiors in Waterdeep about what he has witnessed here. He also has parents and siblings who are no doubt wondering what happened to him.
If his death seems likely, Toru asks one of the characters to take his City Watch badge and return it to his father in Waterdeep. If this is done, Toru's mother-a renowned jewelry artist-gives that character a sapphire bracelet or pendant worth $2,500 \mathrm{gp}$ as a show of her gratitude.
Ahpok, the old grimlock, has an intellect devourer in her skull. She is used by the mind flayers to lure other grimlocks to the colony to have their brains devoured. Ahpok has been unable to leave the colony in recent weeks because of the githyanki, so the illithids have stationed her here with orders to keep an eye on the other prisoners. The grimlock speaks Undercommon. Ahpok claims to know this level of Undermountain by sound, smell, and touch, and offers her services as a guide if the characters agree to set her free. If the characters follow her, Ahpok leads them to the neothelid to be killed and consumed. If the intellect devourer is deprived of its host, it teleports away to seek a new one.

## 11. Halaster Is Glowing

The stone doors to this chamber are sealed with Qualith door locks (see "Qualith Door Locks," page 222). Unless they are held open, the doors automatically close and lock. The ceiling here is 10 feet high. The room has the following features:
Arch. Embedded in the middle of the east wall is a stone arch. Carved into its keystone are three human-like stick figures holding hands.
Statue. In the middle of the room, a statue of a thin, bearded, wild-haired man wearing a robe covered with eyes stands atop a 3 -foot-high block of stone. The statue is surrounded by a faint nimbus of multicolored light and points a stony finger at the eastern arch.
The glowing statue depicts Halaster Blackcloak. It is a magic trap that casts a prismatic spray spell every time a creature emerges from the arch gate in the east wall. (Simply passing between the statue and the gate doesn't trigger the trap.) The rays created by the spell originate from the statue's pointed finger and target all creatures between the statue and the gate (save DC 19).
A detect magic spell reveals auras of abjuration magic and evocation magic around the statue. It melds seamlessly with its base and the floor, as though one with both. It can't be toppled and is impervious to damage.
Close examination of the statue reveals that the eyes carved into its robe, twenty in all, have lids that are locked open. Casting an arcane lock spell on the statue closes the eyelids on all the robe's eyes and deactivates the statue. Encompassing the statue in a darkness spell suppresses the trap for the duration.

## Arch Gate to Level 14

The arch is one of Halaster's magic gates (see "Gates," page 12). Its rules are as follows:

- If three humanoids hold hands while standing within 5 feet of the gate, it opens for 1 minute.
- Characters must be 13th level or higher to pass through this gate (see "Jhesiyra Kestellharp," page 10). The first creature to pass through the gate triggers an elder rune (see "Elder Runes," page 12).
- A creature that passes through the gate appears in area 39 b on level 14 , in the closest unoccupied space next to the identical gate located there.


## 12. DYNAMO

The central feature of the mind flayer colony is a psionic, quasi-magical turbine powered by a thunderous underground river that flows through it.
River water entering the dynamo is channeled along 10 -foot-deep troughs. As the water courses through each trough, it passes U-shaped, gold-plated metal conductors bolted to the sides and bottom of the trough at 10 -foot intervals. The energy from the water is transferred to the conductors and used to power the apparatus in area 12 g and the psipods in areas 14 and 15. After flowing through the dynamo, the water exits through submerged, rough-hewn tunnels carved into the sides of cisterns. The underground river then resumes its natural course, eventually emptying into the Underdark.

---

## UNDERGROUND RIVER

The underground river on this level is swift and loud. Creatures within 20 feet of it are deafened by the roar unless a soundproof barrier or a silence spell blocks the noise. Any creature that starts its turn in the river and isn't anchored must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is swept 60 feet downriver; on a successful save, the distance is halved to 30 feet. The river flows just as strongly through area 12 as it does elsewhere.

Creatures can walk along a stone ledge that hugs the perimeter of the dynamo. The ledge is 1 foot above water level, and four arching wooden bridges span the troughs near the central hub (area 12c). These bridges are securely bolted to the floor. The ceilings above the water collectors are domed and vary in height. The connecting tunnels between the collectors and the bridges have flat, 15 -foot-high ceilings.
All doors leading to this area are made of stone and sealed with Qualith door locks (see "Qualith Door Locks," page 222). Unless they are held open, the doors automatically close and lock.

## 12A. South Water Collector

The ceiling in this chamber forms a dome 20 feet higher than the floor around the cistern, which is 10 feet deep. Water pouring in from the east travels north along a trough that leads toward area 12c.

## 12b. East Water Collector

This area is watched by the ettins that lurk in area 12 h .
The ceiling in this chamber forms a dome 20 feet higher than the floor around the cistern, which is 15 feet deep. Water pouring in from the south travels west along a trough that leads toward area 12c. Excess water flows north through a submerged tunnel blocked by a 10 -foot-diameter, circular iron grate that Tiny creatures can slip through. Forcing open the grate while fighting off the current requires a successful DC 30 Strength (Athletics) check.

## 12c. Central Hub

The ceiling in this chamber forms a dome 40 feet higher than the floor around the cistern, which is 20 feet deep and fed by a submerged tunnel to the southeast. Water also pours in from 10 -foot-deep troughs to the south and east, and forced westward and northward along troughs that lead to areas 12 d and 12 e , respectively.

## 12d. West Water Collector

The ceiling in this chamber forms a dome 20 feet higher than the floor around the cistern, which is 30 feet deep. Water pouring in from the east exits through a submerged tunnel in the north wall of the cistern, 20 feet below the water's surface.

## 12e. North Water Collector

The ceiling in this chamber forms a dome 20 feet higher than the floor around the cistern, which is 40 feet deep. Water flowing in from the south and west exits through a submerged tunnel in the east wall of the cistern, 30 feet below the water's surface.

Two dead grimlocks float in the cistern, with the brains torn out of their skulls. This is where the mind flayers dispose of creatures they feed on. Eventually, the corpses sink and get swept downriver.

## 12f. Dining Experience

The stone door to this room is soundproof, airtight, and sealed with a Qualith door lock (see "Qualith Door Locks," page 222). The ceiling is 10 feet high and flat. The room contains the following features:
Grimlock. A stunned male grimlock is slumped in one of three stone chairs that face the door.
Illithids. Two mind flayers are present. One stands behind the grimlock, feasting on its brain while telepathically communicating the experience to the second mind flayer, which looks on.
Dining on brains is a spectator event for mind flayers. With the aid of telepathy, the diner can convey the pleasures of a meal to other illithids in range. These mind flayers don't like being outnumbered. They try to stun as many characters as possible, then gather reinforcements from area 12 h .
Most of the grimlock's brain is consumed by the time the characters arrive. Short of a raise dead spell or similar magic, there's no way to save the creature from its fate.

## 12g. Control Room

The stone door to this room is soundproof, airtight, and sealed with a Qualith door lock (see "Qualith Door Locks," page 222). The ceiling is 10 feet high and flat. The room contains the following features:
Extremiton. In the middle of the room, the ulitharid (see appendix A) sits on a swiveling crystal throne shaped like a cocoon. The throne's base is shaped from a dark, alien metal. Dozens of thick copper wires connect it to plates of a similar metal bolted to the floor.
Crystal Screen. When the characters first arrive, the throne faces the room's curved back wall, which has rows of pale white crystals embedded in it. These crystals project the flickering, spectral image of the Yawning Portal's taproom, as seen through the eyes of its proprietor, Durnan.
Extractor Staff. A thin crystal stand near the throne holds a black metal staff shaped like a warped, alien spinal column. This is Extremiton's extractor staff (see the "Ulitharid" entry in appendix A).
While seated in its crystal throne, Extremiton is psychically linked to the psipods in areas 14 and 15 and is maintaining its Waterdeep simulation (see "Alterdeep," page 229). If it leaves the throne, the simulation deactivates and the psipods shut down. When this happens, the mind flayers in areas 14 and 15 make their way here to find out why the ulitharid ended the simulation. It takes them 4 rounds to arrive.
Extremiton has enough on its mind without battling adventurers. If cornered here, it tries to negotiate a peaceful settlement. As a lawful evil creature, it tries to uphold its end of any agreement while twisting a badly worded deal to its advantage. Primarily, Extremiton is

---

concerned with its own safety and the elimination of the githyanki. The welfare of the rest of the colony comes second. It places no value on prisoners and gladly releases them if doing so is enough to preserve its life.

The scene projected on the back wall is what Extremiton sees when it looks through the eyes of the virtual Durnan in the alternate version of Waterdeep. The view changes abruptly whenever the ulitharid switches characters in the simulation, and the scene fades entirely when the ulitharid leaves its throne.

Given a chance to do so, the ulitharid is delighted and eager to show off its Alterdeep simulation, which it is using to learn more about Waterdeep and its multifaceted culture. Extremiton fails to mention that once it becomes an elder brain, it plans to use its newfound knowledge to enslave the entire city.

## 12H. Ettin Thralls

This curved chamber has a flat ceiling 10 feet high. Lurking in the dark, empty alcoves to the north and south are four scrawny ettins. At full health, each ettin has 60 hit points.

The ettins' minds have been broken by dominate monster spells cast on them repeatedly by the illithids over many months. These drooling, gibbering, malnourished thralls won't attack illithids or creatures in their company. All other creatures are attacked on sight. The starving ettins hungrily devour any kills.

## 13. BACK DOOR

The double doors to these rooms are airtight, soundproof, made of stone, and sealed with Qualith door locks (see "Qualith Door Locks," page 222). Unless they are held open, the doors automatically close and lock. The ceiling here is 10 feet high.

The mind flayers use this back door to their fortress as a means of escape, in case the colony is overrun by githyanki or other invaders.

## 13a. Treasury

Two chests carved from zurkhwood sit atop low stone tables against the west wall of this room.

Treasure. The chests contain treasure that the mind flayers use to bribe creatures they can't devour or enslave. Each chest contains 800 pp . Characters who dig through the gold also find a pair of purple-tinted crystal spectacles with platinum frames $(2,500 \mathrm{gp})$, a potion of resistance (acid), a Quaal's feather token (tree), and a drow-made dagger with silver web filigree. The dagger magically plays a fragment of a guitar solo when struck or used to strike a foe. The dagger is worth 750 gp .

## 13b. Outer Guard Post

The north wall of this empty, unfurnished room contains a secret door.

## 14. Psipod Nexus I

The doors to this room are made of stone and sealed with Qualith door locks (see "Qualith Door Locks," page 222). Unless they are held open, the doors automatically close and lock. The ceiling here is 10 feet high. The room contains the following features:

Psipods. Resting in iron brackets along the curved walls are fifteen coffin-sized bronze cylinders with lids of transparent crystal. Each capsule is tilted at a 45-degree angle, connected to metal floor panels with thick copper wires, and coated in a thin, slimy residue. Illithids. Four mind flayers carrying dark sheets of metal resembling clipboards are inspecting the capsules, nine of which contain unconscious humanoids.
The mind flayers are tasked with ensuring that the equipment in this room is functioning properly. They try to stun intruders and trap them inside empty psipods (see "Psipods" below). Their "clipboards" are thin sheets of metal with braille-like writing (Qualith) embossed on them. The mind flayers use their tentacles to interpret the writing, which provides technical schematics for the psipods. A comprehend lanǵuages spell or similar magic reveals as much, enabling characters to discern what the psipods do and how to disable them.

## Psipods

A psipod is a magic device that connects the mind of an unconscious humanoid to the mind of the ulitharid in area 12 g . The psychic residue that coats each psipod is a byproduct of this connection. The residue is sticky and foul-smelling, but harmless. It dissolves after a few hours.

Any creature that enters a psipod's bronze cylinder must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious, lulled into that state by a soothing psionic vibration that the ulitharid produces. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw must repeat it at the end of each of its turns unit it exits the cylinder.

While in a psipod, an unconscious creature finds itself drawn into a simulated reality created by the ulitharid (see the "Alterdeep" sidebar) and can survive in this state for the remainder of its natural life, its mind and body nourished by the psipod's psychic energy. If the psipod is shut down, or if the unconscious creature is removed from it, the creature can repeat the DC 17 Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, waking on a success. The creature also awakens if it takes damage in the real world, but not if it takes damage in the Waterdeep simulation.

A psipod shuts down if it is disabled or destroyed. To disable a psipod, a creature must disconnect three of the eight copper wires connecting it to the metal panels in the floor. The mind flayers' schematic pads identify which three wires to disconnect on each psipod. (The combination of wires varies from one psipod to another.) If wires are torn out at random, roll a d8 three times (rerolling duplicate results) to determine which three wires shut down that particular psipod, then roll a d8 for each wire that is disconnected to see if it's one of the correct ones. Disconnecting a wrong wire triggers a magical surge that targets all creatures within 5 feet of the psipod except the one inside it. A targeted creature must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A magical surge from one psipod has no effect on the others.

All the psipods shut down if the ulitharid dies or leaves the crystal throne in area 12 g . Each psipod is a

## Alterdeep

Unconscious creatures in psipods experience the equivalent of a shared dream as they appear with all their carried possessions in Waterdeep-or rather, an alternate version of Waterdeep created by Extremiton.
Through extensive telepathic contact with Waterdavians, the ulitharid has created a realistic simulation of Waterdeep that is constantly being refined for greater authenticity. Within "Alterdeep," the ulitharid takes on various personas and quietly observes how creatures that are projected into the setting by the psipods interact with each other and the fake creatures and objects around them.
Alterdeep looks, sounds, smells, and feels like Waterdeep. Prolonged exposure to this alternate world, however, increases the possibility of detecting a flaw that betrays its true nature. Although Extremiton has created an impressive facsimile, characters who are drawn into the environment notice slight discrepancies in the way familiar NPCs act, or pick up on minor details that the ulitharid has gotten wrong or can't reasonably duplicate: slight changes in decor, books that are blank between the covers, foul-tasting elven wine, dwarves unable to speak Dwarvish, and so on.
As soon as a character encounters such a discrepancy, the ulitharid also becomes aware of it, since their minds are linked. When confronted with an error, Extremiton either takes steps to correct it or tries to draw attention away from it. For example, it doesn't know Dwarvish well enough to cause the residents of Alterdeep to speak it fluently, so it might subtly remove all known Dwarvish-speaking characters from the simulation until its familiarity with that language improves significantly.
The Yawning Portal. The most accurate and fleshed-out location in Alterdeep is the Yawning Portal. Extremiton is particularly fascinated with the establishment, its owner, and its clientele. Most newcomers to the simulation awaken here, and Extremiton tries to create enough situations of interest in the tavern to keep its captive audience engaged. Extremiton appears in the Yawning Portal as its
gruff proprietor, Durnan, though it can inhabit other fake NPCs as well. The ulitharid has focused most of its attention on the Yawning Portal because that location sits atop the entrance to Undermountain and is a hotbed of humanoid interaction.
Damage, Death, and Healing. Creatures can be hurt, healed, and killed in the simulation just as they can be in the real world, and a character reduced to 0 hit points makes death saving throws as normal.
Any creature that joins the simulation by entering a psipod and dies in the simulation also dies for real from the shock, as though it had taken enough psychic damage to instantly kill it. Creatures immune to psychic damage can't be killed by this kind of system shock and stabilize automatically inside the simulation.
Leaving Alterdeep. If characters in the simulation try to escape Alterdeep's city limits, Extremiton creates situations to dissuade them: bad weather, a city-wide lockdown, a festival-whatever it takes. The ulitharid hasn't researched areas outlying the city. Consequently, nothing but thick fog lies beyond the city gates. The same is true for Alterdeep's version of Undermountain; characters who descend the well in the Yawning Portal taproom find themselves enshrouded in fog with nowhere to go but back up. Extremiton, in the guise of Durnan, discourages exploration of Undermountain by claiming that the Mad Mage has magically sealed it off.
Characters who are brought into the simulation can escape only if Extremiton allows it or if their psipods are shut down. The ulitharid might remove one or more characters from the simulation if it finds them too disruptive, in which case they're taken out of their psipods and confined to area 10 until they can be fed to the neothelid in area 8 . The characters can also try to form an alliance with the ulitharid. Extremiton might release them if, in exchange, they promise to destroy the githyanki that are threatening the mind flayer colony. You can roleplay these interactions or have the characters make ability checks to convince Extremiton to let them back into the real world.

Large object with AC 15, 50 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. A creature inside a psipod has total cover against attacks originating from outside the capsule.

## Unconscious Humanoids

Eight of the humanoids in the psipods are commoners of mixed race, alignment, and ethnicity. Their names are Daundarak Steelfist (LG male shield dwarf), Jarana Hammerstone (LG female shield dwarf), Falain Tlandrue (CG female moon elf), Merrily Shadowstep (NG female lightfoot halfling), Jagtar Uythrapp (LG male Mulan human), Lament ( N male tiefling), Stormal Voss (LE male Illuskan human), and Lander Hellwind (CG male Illuskan human). All were abducted from Waterdeep. Apply racial traits to them as warranted, and remember that dwarves, elves, and tieflings have darkvision.
The ninth humanoid is Selphorn Amcathra (NE male Tethyrian human noble). A resident of the town of Amphail, he was abducted after attending the funeral of a cousin in Waterdeep. Selphorn promises a reward of 500 gp for his safe return to the City of Splendors and makes good on his promise, but he puts his self-interest above all other concerns. Characters from Waterdeep would know that House Amcathra is one of the city's wealthiest noble families.

## 15. Psipod Nexus II

This room is identical to area 14 , with these alterations:

- The room contains twenty empty psipods in various stages of completion. (Half of the psipods are fully assembled and functional.)
- Three mind flayers are busily assembling one of the unfinished psipods.


## 16. Old Dwarven Halls

The doors in this area are made of stone and sealed with Qualith door locks (see "Qualith Door Locks," page 222). Unless they are held open, the doors automatically close and lock. Rooms here are 20 feet high with 10 -foot-high corridors connecting them.

## 16a. North Guard Post

Scaladar. Two modified scaladar guard the hall. They are described in more detail below.
Furnishings. Water seeps into the hall through cracks in the arched, 20 -foot-high ceiling, spilling onto a 40 -foot-long stone table surrounded by stone chairs as big as thrones.
Dishware. Shallow niches in the walls hold stone dishes and tankards. Some of the dishware contains

---

globs of edible gray slime. (The mind flayers use these dishes to bring food to prisoners in area 10.)
Wall of Force. The rubble-strewn passage to area 8a is blocked by an invisible wall of force that is generated from area 16 c .

The mind flayers gained control of two scaladar (see appendix A) and implanted duergar brains in them, bestowing on each construct an Intelligence of 11 and the ability to understand (but not speak) Dwarvish and Undercommon. Each duergar brain is contained in a glass sphere embedded in the construct's head. These scaladar obey the commands of illithids and attack any creatures that aren't mind flayers or their thralls. Trobriand's rings no longer have any effect on these constructs.

## 16b. South Guard Post

This misshapen, 20 -foot-high room sits at the top of a sloped tunnel that descends for hundreds of feet to level 18. Guarding the otherwise empty room are eight duergar. If they see light approaching, the duergar turn invisible and enlarge themselves, then ambush anyone that enters the chamber. These duergar have had their minds broken by the mind flayers and fight to the death.

## 16c. Psionic Force Generator

Pedestal. In the middle of the room, two mind flayers grip the top of a 4 -foot-tall, three-sided crystal pedestal with a fist-sized diamond floating 1 foot above it.
Anvils. Piled against the walls are scores of rusty iron anvils forged and abandoned long ago by the Me lairkyn dwarves. (Each one weighs 500 pounds.)
The crystal pedestal with the diamond levitating above it is a psionic force generator, a magic device that allows the mind flayers to create and sustain the walls of force that enclose area 8 . The mind flayers provide the mental energy that powers the generator. If these mind flayers are attacked, one maintains contact with the crystal pedestal while the other defends it.
The diamond no longer floats if removed from its place above the pedestal. A creature within reach of the diamond can use an action to take it. Without the diamond, the generator shuts down and the walls of force in area 8 disappear. The device can't function without the diamond (or another of the same or greater value). The walls of force also disappear if the mind flayers are pulled away from the pedestal-though the walls reappear if contact is reestablished, as long as the diamond is still floating in place. If the walls disappear, the neothelid in area 8 escapes in search of prey, killing and consuming any creatures it finds.
The crystal pedestal is embedded in the floor and can't be knocked over, but it can be destroyed, rendering the generator irreparable. The pedestal is a Small object with AC 13, 20 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.
Treasure. The diamond is worth $5,000 \mathrm{gp}$.

## 17. Grumbling Bridge

Spanning the river at this point is a crumbling stone bridge that can support 200 pounds at a time. Any more weight causes it to collapse. A creature on the bridge when it collapses can leap to one side or the other with a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature falls in the river and might get swept away (see "Underground River," page 227).

## 18. Gray Mold

The walls of this room are streaked with a slimy gray mold, some of which has been scraped off. Under the mold are bas-relief sculptures of dwarves chopping down large mushrooms.
The mold growing here is edible and nutritious, but not tasty. The mind flayers feed it to their prisoners. A small cup of the mold is nutritionally equivalent to a day's worth of rations.

## 19. Unguarded Area

Neither the mind flayers nor their thralls come here.

## 19a. River's Roar

Creatures in this 10 -foot-high, partially collapsed chamber have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing due to the loud roar of the underground river nearby.

## 19b. Safe Shoreline Cave

The 10 -foot-high, rough-hewn chamber is strewn with rubble. The shore is rocky and covered with loose dirt.

## 20. River Branches

The river (see "Underground River," page 227) reaches a depth of 20 feet at this point, where it splits off in three directions. A creature swept along by the river's strong current is pulled in a random direction determined by rolling a d6. On a 1 , the creature is swept into area 12a. On a 2 , the creature is swept into area 12 b . On any other result, the creature is swept into area 12 c .

## Aftermath

If freed from its confinement, the neothelid wanders Seadeeps and consumes any other creature that crosses its path. Characters might try luring it to another level of Undermountain, where it can wreak even more havoc. If the neothelid becomes too great a nuisance, Halaster takes strides to either destroy or contain it.
Killing Extremiton completes a quest (see "Uncover the Telepathic Spy," page 10). Deprived of their leader, the surviving illithids disappear into other corners of Undermountain or return to the Underdark. With the illithids gone, the githyanki move to secure the level with reinforcements from level 16-assuming there are any githyanki left. If the githyanki are wiped out and Extremiton is allowed to live, it eventually turns itself into an elder brain, which attracts more illithids to the colony. In addition, the illithids continue to capture people from Waterdeep for their Alterdeep simulation, which grows more intricate and nuanced every day.

ANRAKDOOM IS DESIGNED FOR FOUR 15TH-LEVEL characters, and those who defeat the monsters on this level should gain enough XP to advance halfway to 16th level. The level is named after Vanrak Moonstar, a Waterdavian noble who turned to the worship of Shar (god of darkness and loss), descended into Undermountain, and became a death knight. To grasp what's happening on this level and why, one needs to know the fate that befell Lord Moonstar.

## The Dark Fate of Lord

## Vanrak Moonstar

Adherents of Shar have been active in the shadow of Mount Waterdeep ever since a disastrous expedition to the Black Jungles mounted in the Year of the Dark Dawn (1104 DR) by Lord Vanrak Moonstar, a charismatic, outgoing swashbuckler. Vanrak was but a pale shadow of his former self when he returned. A few tendays later, his father, Lord Andvarran Moonstar, the family patriarch, died of a strange wasting disease that could not be cured by healing magic.
Upon assuming leadership of House Moonstar, Vanrak publicly broke with the temple of Selûne (god of the moon), which he blamed for his father's untimely death. Consumed with bitterness, the Dark Ranger, as Vanrak came to be known, secretly embraced Selûne's sister: Shar, the Lady of Loss.
By the Year of the Howling Moon (1130 DR), House Moonstar was in open schism. Family members who
still venerated Selûne aligned themselves with Lord Vanrak's sister, Lady Alathene, and Selûne's priesthood. Meanwhile, Lord Vanrak and his followers extended their dark influence over much of the city's harbor with the aid of a small army of mercenaries bolstered by followers of Shar.
Lady Alathene appeared in open court and asked the Lords of Waterdeep to strip her brother of his title and banish him from the city. She also presented evidence of her brother's numerous crimes, including slavery, arson, theft, and murder. The Lords ordered the immediate capture of the Dark Ranger, but by the time the City Watch had breached the gates of his villa, Vanrak and his followers had already fled through a secret portal into Undermountain. He and his followers remained there until, in the Year of the Dark Mask (1171 DR), they conquered the level of Undermountain that came to be known as Vanrakdoom.
Operating from his new base, Vanrak extended his influence throughout much of Undermountain and even periodically dispatched elite strike teams to battle followers of Selûne in the city above. He achieved his most dramatic success in the Year of the Tomb (1182 DR), when his followers infiltrated the High House of Stars through its cellars, slaughtered most of the inhabitants before they could raise an alarm, engulfed the temple in black fire, and burned it to the ground. The invaders also acquired enough treasure from the temple vaults to fund Lord Vanrak's personal quest for immortality. Within a few years, the Dark Ranger had transformed himself into a death knight.

---

The Lords of Waterdeep didn't make things easy for Vanrak Moonstar in the years that followed. They hired waves of adventurers to descend into Undermountain to bring Vanrak and his followers to justice. Although none of these adventurers succeeded, they winnowed down Vanrak's army to the point where he could no longer threaten the city.

Halaster Blackcloak compounded Vanrak's woes by urging other Undermountain dwellers to invade Vanrakdoom from time to time. In a desperate move, the few remaining priests of Shar performed rituals to harness the despair of Vanrak's shadow dragon mount, Umbraxakar, and use him to transport Vanrakdoom into the Shadowfell. In the end, Halaster's magical hold over Undermountain proved too strong to overcome, yet a small section of Vanrakdoom crossed over into the Plane of Shadow and became ensconced there.

Confronted by failure, Vanrak came to believe that Shar had deceived him and had orchestrated his downfall solely to spite her nemesis, Selûne. Vanrak had lost his family, his title, and most of his army, and he was in danger of losing hold over his domain. In the Year of Silent Shadows (1436 DR), he renounced his faith in Shar and begged Selûne's forgiveness for the destruction of her temple and its followers. In a desperate act of redemption, the death knight destroyed his undead form using a sun blade. A vampire cleric of Shar named Keresta Delvingstone has ruled Vanrakdoom ever since.

With the shadow of Vanrak faded from memory, House Moonstar has prospered. The Waterdavian family is currently overseen by the once shrewd but now senile Lady Wylynd Moonstar, a venerable human noblewoman who, by last estimate, is well over a century old. Although she has no children of her own, Wylynd is surrounded by distant relatives, including a savvy half-drow grandnephew named Helion Moonstar, whom she has chosen to be her heir. The family's business interests lie in cartography and exploration, and Wylynd has been known to fund expeditions to Undermountain from time to time for reasons she prefers to keep to herself.

## What Dwells Here?

This level is controlled by servants of Shar and creatures of shadow.

## Keresta Delvingstone

Keresta Delvingstone grew up in the streets of Waterdeep and is no stranger to hardship. Hoping to make a better life for herself, she became an adventurer and sought fame and fortune in Undermountain. Keresta met her end in the lair of a vampire and became a vampire spawn under its command.

After Vanrak destroyed the vampire and conquered its lair, he took Keresta under his wing. Consumed by darkness and loss, Keresta was drawn to Shar like a moth to a flame and rose to become a vampire cleric of the evil god. She now leads Shar's debased cult in Vanrakdoom and intends to send the group on a mission to destroy the Spires of the Morning, the temple of Lathander (god of birth and renewal) in Waterdeep. She also has her sights set on destroying the House of the Moon-

Waterdeep's temple of Selûne, whom she blames for the destruction of Vanrak Moonstar.

Keresta is a vampire, with these changes:

- Keresta summons giant centipedes instead of wolves.
- She gains the Spellcasting feature described below.

Spellcasting. Keresta is a 9th-level spellcaster. Her spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 15, +7 to hit with spell attacks). She has the following cleric spells prepared:
Cantrips (at will): guidance, mending, resistance, thaumaturgy 1st level (4 slots): bane, command, inflict wounds, ray of sickness 2nd level (3 slots): blindness/deafness, ray of enféeblement, spiritual weapon
3rd level (3 slots): animate dead, bestow curse, dispel magic, spirit guardians
4th level (3 slots): blight, death ward, divination
5th level (1 slot): antilife shell, destructive wave

## Regional Effects

Vanrakdoom is Keresta's lair, and the following regional effects are noticeable throughout it:

- Fog creeps into areas of dim light or darkness. It vanishes when light is brought to bear on it but reappears when the light passes. A permanent fog hangs in some areas regardless of light, as noted in the descriptions of those areas.
- Rats and bats are plentiful. In areas where they are not specifically mentioned, droppings and guano betray their presence, and they can be heard constantly scuttling and shrieking in the distant darkness.
If Keresta is destroyed, the fog disperses, and the rats and bats gradually die off until only a scattered few remain.


## Umbraxakar

The shadow dragon Umbraxakar used to be a lawful good bronze dragon named Glyster. Fond of assuming human form, Glyster was Vanrak Moonstar's friend and companion, remaining by the noble's side even after Vanrak's fall from grace. Glyster tried to turn Vanrak away from the worship of Shar, to no avail, and the dragon sank into despair. In this forlorn state, he allowed Shar's priests to transform him into a shadow dragon to better serve Vanrak in the battles to come. Thereafter, Glyster became known as Umbraxakar ("shadowborn" in Draconic).

The death knight and the shadow dragon fought side by side for many years, expanding their domain and then defending it against adventurers and other invaders. By this time, Umbraxakar had stopped caring about anything except his friendship with Vanrak. The friendship finally ended when Vanrak destroyed himself with a sun blade, leaving Umbraxakar and the remnants of Shar's wicked cult to fend for themselves.

## Visions of Umbraxakar

As characters explore areas of Vanrakdoom, they experience magical visions of terrible things that the dragon experienced long ago. These visions, byproducts of Umbraxakar's despair, provide clues that can help free the dragon from his dark curse. A character does not ex-

---

perience such visions within an antimagic field or while under the protection of a dispel evil or good spell.
Characters also encounter magical projections of Umbraxakar. These shadowy images take the form of harmless, dragon-shaped clouds of black fog. A projection that is targeted by a dispel magic spell or touched by an antimagic field is destroyed instantly. It otherwise cannot be harmed.

## Cult of Shar

The cult of Shar in Vanrakdoom consists mainly of vampire spawn under the command of Keresta Delvingstone. Living cultists also find their way here from time to time, guided through Undermountain by the dark grace of Shar herself. Keresta turns the most promising acolytes into vampire spawn. Those deemed unworthy of Shar's blessing nourish Keresta and her spawn with their blood, after which Umbraxakar devours the exsanguinated corpses.
Cultists are neutral evil humans who wear dusty gray robes over their armor. These robes bear the symbol of Shar: a black circle bordered in dark purple.

## InTO THE SHADOWFELL

Areas 19 through 33 of Vanrakdoom are ensconced in the Shadowfell and remain there as long as Umbraxakar is alive. In these areas, bright light is reduced to dim light, and dim light to darkness. In addition, all color has been drained from these areas, and a deathly stench hangs in the air. The walls are severely cracked, the floor tiles are buckled and broken in numerous places, and the ceilings have begun to sag as though they won't remain in place much longer.
Areas within the Shadowfell are no longer part of Undermountain and therefore aren't subject to its magical restrictions (see "Alterations to Magic," page 10).
The shadow dragon's despair can cause other areas of Vanrakdoom to slide in and out of the Shadowfell at irregular intervals-sometimes for a few seconds or minutes, sometimes for hours. Any such shift happens at your discretion and lasts as long as you want. When an area slides into the Shadowfell, all colors and lights within the area become muted as described above.

## SHADOWFELL DESPAIR

Characters who linger in the Shadowfell might become fraught with despair (see "Optional Rule: Shadowfell Despair" in chapter 2 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).

## Exploring This Level

All location descriptions for this level are keyed to map 18. Areas of Vanrakdoom that have shifted into the Shadowfell have darker shading around them on the map.

## 1. Entrance

Characters who descend the tunnel from level 17 come to a series of rough-hewn tunnels that open into a 10 -foot-high corridor of smooth worked stone.

## 2. Dusty Emptiness

This room and its connected corridors have 10 -foot-high ceilings and floors covered with dust.

## 3. Statue of Shar

Fog. The room is lightly obscured by fog.
Statue. The east corner holds a black marble statue of a cloaked woman wielding two daggers. Three dust-covered human skeletons lie at the statue's feet
Robed Figure. Kneeling before the statue is a humanoid figure in a purple and black robe.
The kneeling figure is an empty robe that collapses into a pile on the floor if it is disturbed or targeted by a dispel magic spell.
The skeletons lying at the statue's feet are the remains of long-dead adventurers placed here as a warning not to disturb the 7 -foot-tall statue. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Religion) check can ascertain that the statue depicts Shar.

## 4. Old Friends

Fog. The room is lightly obscured by fog.
Tapestries. Shredded tapestries that once depicted coastal scenes lie in heaps near the walls. Disturbing the tapestries causes a harmless, smoky projection of Umbraxakar to appear in the middle of the room. It rushes toward intruders, hoping to scare them away.
Vision. Any character who moves more than halfway into the room experiences one of the shadow dragon's fleeting visions.

## Dragon's Vision

In this vision, the character is standing before a cloaked nobleman (Lord Vanrak Moonstar) on a windy cliff overlooking the sea. The noble asks the character to join him on a dangerous quest into the Black Jungles. Putting a hand on the character's shoulder, the man asks, "We are the best of friends, Glyster, are we not?" With that, the vision ends.

## 5. Umbraxakar's Gift

Fog. The room is lightly obscured by fog.
Bas-Reliefs. The walls are covered with bas-relief carvings of jumbled human skeletons.
Vision. Any character who moves more than halfway into the room experiences one of the shadow dragon's fleeting visions.

## Dragon's Vision

In this vision, the character is camped in a jungle with a handsome nobleman (Lord Vanrak Moonstar). The character hands the knight a polished coral ring as a token of their enduring friendship. Putting the ring on his hand, the nobleman smiles and says, "I will treasure this gift forever." With that, the vision ends.
Treasure. The first character to receive this vision steps on a ring lying on the floor. Close examination reveals that the ring is the one from the dragon's vision: a polished coral band that glimmers with a rainbow of color. The ring is nonmagical and worth 250 gp .

---

## 6. Cultists' Quarters

Furnishings. Six empty wooden bunk beds line the north and east walls. Between the bunks are stone shelves stocked with rations, casks of water, wooden dishware, and steel utensils.
Arch. Embedded in the south wall is a stone arch, its sides carved in the form of scantily clad elves (one male and one female) holding fingers to their lips in a gesture of silence.
Secret Door. A secret door in the east wall leads to area 5.

## Arch Gate to Level 6

The stone arch is one of Halaster's magic gates (see "Gates," page 12). Its rules are as follows:

- If a silence spell is cast so that the arch falls within the spell's area, the gate opens for 1 minute.
- Characters must be 9th level or higher to pass through this gate (see "Jhesiyra Kestellharp," page 10). The first creature to pass through the gate triggers an elder rune (see "Elder Runes," page 12).
- A creature that passes through the gate appears in area 47 a on level 6 , in the closest unoccupied space next to the identical gate located there.


## 7. Halls of Worship

Cultists gather in this area to worship Shar and suffer Keresta's tests of devotion.

## 7a. Crawling Rats

Characters hear human voices chanting as they approach this chamber, which contains the following:
Purple Flames. The walls are lined with rusty iron sconces, each holding a torch coated in black wax that burns with a purple flame.
Cult Ritual. Six human cultists of Shar kneel on rough woven mats in the center of this area, chanting in low tones. A human cult fanatic engulfed in a swarm of rats stands quietly in their midst.
The kneeling cultists are named Caradoc, Feldar, Hong, Khafra, Serenade, and Xandeval. They are chanting the following verse over and over in Common: "Darkness quench the sun. Darkness swallow the moon. We are nothing but the night."
Keresta Delvingstone is using the swarm of rats to test the cult fanatic, whose name is Jian. To pass the test, Jian must allow the rats to crawl over his body without fear or protest, or else they will devour him. Only by passing this test can Jian qualify to become one of Keresta's vampire spawn.
The arrival of intruders prompts the cultists to take up arms and attack. Jian, however, does nothing while the rats swarm over him. If he takes damage, Jian panics and is swiftly devoured by the rats. If the swarm loses more than half its hit points, it scatters and flees.

## 7b. Ritual Preparation

Table. In the middle of the room stands a wooden trestle table bearing a small pile of treasure, along with bottles of oil and flickering candles.

Cultists. Two human cultists of Shar are anointing the precious baubles with oil.
The cultists are named Elthimar and Zelaya. They are carefully anointing items that have been plucked from Umbraxakar's hoard-treasures that will be used in rituals to tether the shadow dragon's memories to specific areas of Vanrakdoom.
Treasure. The items on the table include three silver bowls ( 25 gp each), two ceremonial daggers with wavy obsidian blades ( 75 gp each), a coral figurine of a mermaid clutching a pink pearl ( 250 gp ), a carved harp of exotic wood with ivory inlay and zircon gemstones ( 750 gp ), and a crystal dragon mask ( $2,500 \mathrm{gp}$ ).

## 7c. Feeding Hall

Cultists unworthy of becoming vampire spawn are brought here to nourish Keresta's brood.
Vampires' Feast. A dead male human lies naked on a chaise longue in the center of the room, his castoff purple and black robe draped over a small table nearby. Two vampire spawn loom over the body, one slurping ferociously at the corpse's wrist while the other sinks her fangs deeper into the corpse's thigh.
Purple Flames. The walls are lined with rusty iron sconces, each holding a torch coated in black wax that burns with a purple flame. Situated between the sconces are fancy wooden chairs with red-cushioned seats and backrests.
Secret Door. A secret door in the east wall leads to area 8 .
The vampire spawn, named Angelica and Yaveros, hiss at intruders and demand they leave at once, attacking those who disobey. Close examination of the dead cultist reveals no signs of a struggle, suggesting that he offered no resistance as he died from exsanguination.

## 8. Scintilmorn's Rest

Fog. The room is lightly obscured by fog.
Vision and Hilt. Any character who moves more than halfway into the room experiences one of the shadow dragon's fleeting visions and notices the shiny hilt of a longsword lying on the fog-shrouded floor (see "Treasure" below).

## Dragon's Vision

In this vision, the character confronts a man in a mithral chain shirt (Lord Vanrak Moonstar). The man's eyes brim with madness as he levels a longsword with a radiant blade at the character and screams, "What have we to fear from darkness, you and I? Undermountain is where we belong. It calls to us-can't you hear it?" Waving the sword in the air like a lunatic, he continues, "Together we shall see the Moonstar name elevated to glorious heights my father could never dream of! Waterdeep will shudder at the very sound of it!" With that, the vision ends.

## Treasure

The hilt lying on the floor is carved to resemble a bronze dragon with its wings spread and its mouth agape. This device is a sun blade that has held many names over the

Map 18: Vanrakdoom

---

years, including Sunlight's Wrath and Shar's Bane. A legend lore spell reveals its true name (Scintilmorn) and its original purpose: to destroy vampires and other creatures of the night.
Umbraxakar's Projection. If the hilt of the sun blade is picked up, Umbraxakar's smoky projection forms in the middle of the room (see "Visions of Umbraxakar," page 232). It can't leave the area.

## 9. Shadow Vigil

Double Door. Carved into the double door to the north are two figures: a skeletal warrior clutching the bladeless hilt of a sword on the left door, and a handsome young man with dragon wings on the right door. Above the double door is a 3 -foot-diameter disk painted black with a purple metal rim (the symbol of Shar).
Cultists and Rats. Twelve human cultists of Shar are chanting outside the doors. Crawling around their feet are four swarms of rats.
Purple Flames. Mounted on the back walls of four wide alcoves are rusty iron sconces, each holding a torch coated in black wax that burns with a purple flame. The walls of the alcoves are cracked and pitted.
The rats attack creatures not dressed as cultists of Shar. The cultists are chanting to help focus the power of the ritual taking place in area 10 , and they try to kill anyone they believe is not a Shar worshiper. They chant the following verse over and over in Common: "Darkness quench the sun. Darkness swallow the moon. Darkness claim this dungeon and all that dwell within."
Knowing that the ritual in area 10 must not be disturbed, the cultists do everything they can to prevent the doors to that area from being opened. If characters enter through the double door, the cultists assume the ritual has already been interrupted and attack immediately.

## 10. Ritual Chamber

Purple Flames. Black wax candles set in niches along the walls of this 20 -foot-high room burn with a purple flame, filling the room with dim light.
Cult Ritual. Six cult fanatics are chanting in unison. Each one stands next to a black stone pillar and is focused on a roiling fog cloud, 8 feet in diameter, that floats at the center of the room 10 feet above the floor. Lines of black energy run between the pillars and the cloud.
The cult fanatics are named Abberoch, Belora, Liana, Shanzo, Torfiana, and Uzalyn. They are performing a ritual designed to anchor one of Umbraxakar's memories to this room, which will enable the shadow dragon to pull more of Vanrakdoom into the Shadowfell. They chant the following verse over and over in Common: "Darkness quench the sun. Darkness swallow the moon. Darkness claim this dungeon and all that dwell within." If attacked, they continue to chant while also defending themselves.
Killing a cult fanatic deactivates one of the pillars, destroying the line of energy emanating from it and weakening the ritual. When all six lines of energy are destroyed, the fog cloud vanishes.

As long as at least one column is active, characters see a faint image in the cloud of an adult bronze dragon surrounded by figures in black robes wearing the holy symbol of Shar and reading from scrolls. As the great creature writhes in pain, its bronze scales begin to darken.
The lines of black energy between the pillars and the cloud are 10 feet above the floor and easily avoided. Any creature that comes into contact with one takes 10 (3d6) necrotic damage from it.

## Surprise!

Each time a cult fanatic dies, a shadow assassin (see appendix A) rises from the fanatic's corpse and joins the battle, acting on the same initiative count as the fanatic that "birthed" it. The shadow assassins guard the room thereafter.

## Treasure

Each cult fanatic carries an obsidian holy symbol of Shar ( 25 gp each). The leader, Abberoch, also has a silver rod with one end formed in the shape of a key ( 70 gp ). The rod unlocks the double door in area 18.

## 11. Tunnels and Caverns

These rough-hewn tunnels are centuries old, but they offer no clues as to their origin. A tunnel to the north slopes downward and eventually leads to level 19.

## 12. Candlelit Halls

The walls of these 10 -foot-high corridors and chambers are lined with shallow niches holding black wax candles that burn with a purple light.
If the characters have had an easy time thus far, Keresta might send waves of vampire spawn to harangue them as they make their way through these candlelit halls. The vampire spawn attack in packs of $1 \mathrm{~d} 4+2$ and avoid the pit traps in areas 12 c and 12 d by crawling along the walls.

## 12A. Bat Roosts

The bare walls and floors of these connected chambers are covered with bat guano, and the 10 -foot-high ceiling is made of rough stone. Four swarms of bats gather here. They shriek in response to intruders and flee the area if disturbed.
Secret Door. A secret door in the north wall leads to area 8 .

## 12b. Magic Mouth

The first character to move past the midpoint of this area triggers a magic mouth spell cast on the floor, which says in Common, "Turn back now, or abandon hope!" The spell resets after 1 hour.

## 12c. Pit of Darkness

An open 20 -foot-deep pit spans the corridor in this location. The pit is filled with impenetrable darkness similar to that created by the darkness spell. A successful dispel magic spell cast on the magical darkness ends it, though the darkness reappears after 1 hour. Other than the darkness, the pit contains nothing.

---

## 12D. Pit of Bones

A 20 -foot-deep pit spans the corridor in this location. The bottom of the pit is filled with the bones of rats that fell in and fed on each other until they all died.

## 13. VAMPIRE DENS

The stench of death pervades these filthy dens.

## 13a. Mad Spawn

Brek, a vampire spawn who succumbed to despair and madness after falling out of Keresta's favor, is crouching on the ceiling in the northeast corner of this otherwise empty room, muttering to himself. He believes intruders to be figments of his imagination until they attack.

## 13b. Resting Spawn

The floor of this room, littered with scores of wooden coffins, is difficult terrain. Some of the coffins are intact, while others have fallen apart with age. Most are empty, but three of the coffins contain resting vampire spawn named Deviana, Ezra, and Yuri. Characters who succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity (Stealth) check can move through this room without waking the spawn. Otherwise, all three awaken and attack.
Treasure. Characters who search through all the coffins find a silver rod with one end carved in the shape of a key ( 70 gp ). The rod unlocks the double door in area 18.

## 13c. Empty Hall

Six web-draped pillars buttress the 20 -foot-high ceiling of this otherwise empty hall.

## 14. Temple ChandlerY

Torches used throughout Vanrakdoom are coated with a black wax that burns with a purple flame. The cultists of Shar know the secret process of making this wax, which they also use to fashion their candles.
This room contains all the supplies and tools needed to create black wax candles and torches, including flasks of oil, ceramic crucibles, and wooden candle molds. The supplies and tools rest on wooden tables spaced haphazardly about the room.

## 15. Shattered Throne

Ceiling. The vaulted ceiling soars to a height of 30 feet and is braced by ornate, crumbling stone arches.
Fog. The room is lightly obscured by fog.
Vision and Crumbled Throne. Any character who crosses the chamber's midpoint experiences one of the shadow dragon's fleeting visions and notices a pile of rubble at the end of the hall: the shattered remains of a stone throne.

## Dragon's Vision

In this vision, the character is standing next to a skeletal warrior with red pinpricks of light in his eye sockets (Lord Vanrak Moonstar). Slumped in a stone throne, he says, "Is this to be the legacy of Vanrak Moonstar? A shadow king damned to rule these moonless halls, fending off assassins, mad wizards, and ghosts of the
ancient dead? Is this all that Shar has to offer? I have drunk my fill of darkness and loss, old friend." With that, the vision ends.

## Vanrak's Throne

Fog swirls around the pile of shattered stone near the south wall that was once Vanrak's throne. If anyone approaches within 10 feet of the rubble, a smoky projection of Umbraxakar rises from the shattered throne and tries to frighten away interlopers, though it can do no harm. It fades away if the rubble is disturbed.
Treasure. Buried under the rubble is Vanrak Moonstar's ancient mithral armor (chain shirt), which has the additional property of granting its wearer darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If a character dons this armor in Vanrakdoom, two shadow assassins (see appendix A) materialize nearby and attack the character.

## 16. Arch Gate to Level 15

Ceiling. This chamber soars to a height of 30 feet.
Arch. A stone arch set into the south wall is decorated with gold-inlaid images of dragons in flight. Carved into the wall above the arch are the following words in Draconic: "Only a dragon can unlock this gate."
Fountains. Alcoves to the west and east contain stone fountains, each carved to look like a perched bronze dragon spouting water into an ornate stone basin.
The fountains are fed by an underground spring and flow with clean, cool water. The living inhabitants of Vanrakdoom depend on this water for their survival.
A fountain's 4 -foot-tall dragon sculpture can be broken off with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check and used to activate the arch gate in this room. Each sculpture is a Small object that weighs 500 pounds.

## ARCH GATE

The arch is one of Halaster's gates (see "Gates," page 12). Its rules are as follows:

- The gate opens for 1 minute when a real or illusory dragon touches the arch. An artistic rendering of a dragon, such as a dragon-shaped figurine or a drawing of a dragon, also opens the gate.
- Characters must be 13th level or higher to pass through this gate (see "Jhesiyra Kestellharp," page 10). The first creature to pass through the gate triggers an elder rune (see "Elder Runes," page 12).
- A creature that passes through the gate appears in area 30a on level 15, in the closest unoccupied space next to the similar gate located there.


## 17. Lost Dwarven Horn

Fog. The room is lightly obscured by fog.
Hooks and Horn. The walls are lined with small iron hooks upon which pictures were once hung. Hanging from a hook on the east wall is a gold horn encrusted with gems (see "Treasure" below).
Vision. Any character who spends at least 1 minute searching the room experiences one of the shadow dragon's fleeting visions.

---

## Dragon's Vision

In this vision, the character is in a great hall buttressed by six columns (area 32), looming above six blindfolded adventurers bound to the columns with rope. A hollow voice (that of Lord Vanrak Moonstar) issues a terrible command: "Umbraxakar, give these fools the death they deserve!" A cone of necrotic energy erupts from the character as the shadow dragon engulfs the nearest prisoner, a male dwarf stripped of gear, with its breath weapon. As the dwarf shrivels and dies, an undead shadow rises from his corpse, and the vision ends.

## Treasure

A character who studies the gem-encrusted gold horn and succeeds on a DC 25 Intelligence (History) check recognizes it as a one-of-a-kind warning horn entrusted to the royal heir of the Thurumbra clan, a family of shield dwarves thought to have been wiped out by orcs more than a century ago in the distant Sunset Mountains. Dwarf characters have advantage on the check. The horn is worth $2,500 \mathrm{gp}$ as an art object but can be sold for $7,500 \mathrm{gp}$ to a buyer who appreciates its status as a historical relic.

## 18. ShAdow's EdGe

Two tunnels converge on a 20 -foot-high chamber that contains the following features:
Statues. Two 12 -foot-tall obsidian statues stand atop 5 -foot-high blocks of stone in alcoves, facing one another. Each statue depicts a faceless robed woman holding a silver thread taut between her outstretched hands.
Shadow Curtain. A thin, translucent curtain of shadow stretches between the statues, rippling like black cloth in a light breeze.
Locked Double Door. Beyond the shadowy curtain is a 12 -foot-tall arched double door with an ornate carving of a bronze dragon above it, its wings forming the door frame. Draconic letters are carved into the floor in front of the double door.
A detect magic spell reveals an aura of conjuration magic around each strand of silver thread. The threads can be cut only by a magic sword. Cutting a thread causes it to disappear but also causes an elder rune (see "Elder Runes," page 12) to momentarily appear between the statue's hands. This elder rune specifically targets the creature that cut the thread. To determine which rune appears, draw a card from the Elder Runes Deck (see appendix B). The shadow curtain disappears when both silver threads are cut.
The rippling curtain of shadow that stretches between the two statues extends from floor to ceiling and radiates a strong aura of necromantic magic under the scrutiny of a detect magic spell. The statues are flush with the walls behind them, so circumventing the curtain is not possible.
Any creature that moves through the curtain must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The greater danger of the curtain is less obvious: if the double door is forced open,
six wraiths emerge from the curtain and attack, pursuing creatures that flee. A wraith that has nothing to attack on its turn enters the shadow curtain and vanishes. The wraiths don't appear once the curtain disappears.

## Locked Double Door

The Draconic inscription on the floor in front of the double door reads, "The shadow is the key." Carved into the floor above the inscription is a small, 3-inch-deep keyhole that contains no locking mechanism. A silver rod with a key-shaped end, which can be found in areas 10 and 13b, fits into this keyhole perfectly. Using a light source to cast the shadow of a rod-key onto the doors causes them to swing open, allowing access to area 19. It is this shadow, not the key itself, that unlocks the doors. Unless they are held open, the doors close and lock on their own after being open for 1 minute. The doors are not locked from the other side and can be opened from area 19 without a rod-key.
The locked doors can also be opened with a knock spell or similar magic, or forced open with a successful DC 28 Strength (Athletics) check.

## 19. Hall of Death

Characters entering this hall for the first time feel as though they've crossed a planar threshold of some kind, but a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check is needed to confirm that this part of the dungeon resides in the Shadowfell. All color has been drained from this hall, which greets visitors with the stench of death (see "Into the Shadowfell," page 233). The hall's other features are as follows:
Ceiling. The ceiling is arched and 30 feet high.
Skulls and Bones. Old skulls and bones (the remains of dead adventurers and monsters) have been swept into alcoves along the hall's southern stretch.
Vision. Any character who opens a door leading west or east experiences one of the shadow dragon's visions.
If the bones are disturbed, a giant spectral mouth with fangs appears, floating 10 feet in front of the double door to the south. It recites the following verse in Common before disappearing:
Welcome to Umbraxakar's lair.
A dragon held in the grip of despair
Conjures memories of his departed friend:
Upon sunlight's blade, he met his end.

## Dragon's Vision

In this vision, the character is engaged in hand-to-hand combat with a man wearing a mithral chain shirt (Lord Vanrak Moonstar). The brawl ends when the man is knocked to the floor, stumbles to his feet, draws the bronzed hilt of a sun blade that suddenly burns with radiance, and says, "Remember this? Your gift to me? Challenge me again, and I'll carve out that big heart of yours and eat it!" The viewer's perspective changes as the character transforms into a bronze dragon and says in Common, "Vanrak! I am your friend. Listen to me. She's using the pain of your father's death to lead you down the darkest of all paths. For the love of Selûne, do not follow her!" With that, the vision ends.

---

## 20. Any Moonstars in Here?

Furnishings. Along the room's perimeter are padded wooden chairs and fine tapestries that have fallen apart with age, leaving piles of moldy lumber and tattered cloth. An oval rug covering much of the floor is tattered and severely worn with age.
Projection. The first time any creature steps into the room, a menacing draconic form takes shape in the fog. The draconic form looms in the middle of the room and tries to frighten away interlopers with its foreboding presence. Like the shadow dragon's other projections, this one is harmless.
A character who examines the rug and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check notices that it bears a large, faded crest of a silver crescent moon and four silver stars set against a field of royal blue. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (History) check reveals that the crest belongs to the Moonstar family of Waterdeep, presided over by the venerable Lady Wylynd Moonstar.

## 21. Clutter

This 10 -foot-high room is cluttered with decaying furnishings and the skeletal remains of adventurers and monsters killed long ago. Because of the detritus, the floor of the room is difficult terrain.

## 22. Under Black Sheets

Sheets and Statues. Black sheets are draped over six wooden statues in the northern portion of the room. (Each statue is a painted, life-size representation of Lord Vanrak Moonstar as a death knight.)
Vision. Any character who lifts or pulls away a black drape experiences one of Umbraxakar's visions.

## Dragon's Vision

In this vision, the character is in the presence of Vanrak Moonstar, a death knight wearing a mithral chain shirt and clutching a bladeless sword hilt. "This is not the fate either of us deserved," he says mournfully. "In darkness, we have lost our way." With that, he causes a blade of light to spring from the sword hilt and drives it down his own throat, reducing his skeletal form to dust. The blade is snuffed out, and all goes dark as the hilt clatters to the floor alongside the death knight's mithral chain shirt. The vision ends with a dragon's anguished roar.

## 23. DeGrepit Dining Hall

Two rusty iron chandeliers hang like giant spiders from the 20 -foot-high ceiling, their chains attached to winches mounted to the east wall. Beneath the chandeliers stretches a long wooden table surrounded by twelve high-backed wooden chairs. The furnishings are decrepit and draped in cobwebs.

## 24. DeGrepit Kitchen

The centerpiece of this 10 -foot-high chamber is a freestanding stone oven that was once heated by magical flames but now stands dark and unused. Lining the walls are worktables and cupboards piled with dishware and utensils that haven't seen use in years.

## 25. Prisoner of Darkness

The characters are not the only adventurers to have recently explored this level. One of those who came before them has succumbed to the Shadowfell's despair.

## 25a. Vampiric Guards

Corroded, broken weapons litter this hall, as if a battle had been fought here long ago. Clinging to the ceiling above the eastern door are three vampire spawn named Darvanos, Hekella, and Tozu. They guard the prisoner in area 25 b and attack anyone they don't recognize.

Hekella carries the key that unlocks the prisoner's shackles in area 25 b .

## 25b. Pantry

Mold. Black mold clings to the walls, and the air is heavy with the scent of rot.
Prisoner. A human adventurer named Portia Dzuth is chained up to the north. Her armor and equipment lie in a heap to the south.

Portia Dzuth hails from Rashemen. She is the sole survivor of an adventuring party hired by Lady Wylynd Moonstar of Waterdeep to find Umbraxakar the shadow dragon and transform him back into Glyster the bronze dragon, friend of House Moonstar. Portia thinks Umbraxakar's curse can be undone by ridding the dragon of its despair, but she has no idea how to accomplish this. She and her companions were captured less than a month ago, but Portia has lost track of time and believes she has been imprisoned in Vanrakdoom for much longer. The vampire spawn feed on Portia whenever blood is in short supply, and she has the bite marks to prove it. After each feeding, Keresta charms Portia to keep her calm and under control.

A character can free Portia from her shackles using the key in area 25a, or by picking the lock with thieves' tools and a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. A character can also free Portia by snapping her chains with a successful DC 30 Strength (Athletics) check.

Portia sank into madness and despair after she was forced to watch Umbraxakar devour the corpses of her slain companions one by one. She stays close to her rescuers, serving as a loyal follower until she is safely out of Undermountain or until Keresta asks her to betray them. While fighting on the party's side, Portia claims an equal share of all XP gained. She is a champion (see appendix A), with these changes:

- Portia is lawful neutral and speaks Common.
- She is magically charmed by Keresta and regards the vampire as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. This effect wears off in 12 hours unless Keresta charms her again.
- She suffers from Shadowfell despair manifesting as unshakable dread. Until the despair ends, she has disadvantage on all saving throws and gains the following flaw: "I'm convinced that I'm going to die in Vanrakdoom." She can attempt to end her despair each time she finishes a long rest, doing so with a successful DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. A calm emotions spell also ends her despair, as does any spell or other magical effect that removes a curse.

---

## 26. VAMPIRE Boss

If the characters haven't already encountered and defeated Keresta Delvingstone, she's here when they arrive (see "Keresta Delvingstone," page 232). The vampire is not alone. The room's features are as follows:
Ceiling. The 30 -foot-high ceiling is supported by two thick stone columns that have rusty iron torch brackets mounted to them.
Vampires in the Fog. The floor is heavily obscured by a 2 -foot-deep blanket of fog. Nine vampire spawn crawl under the fog and try to remain hidden until Keresta commands them to attack.
Keresta Delvingstone. Keresta looks like a pale woman with a large dragon tattoo imprinted on her pale skin. She stands in the middle of the room, studying a large piece of parchment spread across a wooden table in front of her. Looming behind her is Thagor, an 18 -foottall abominable yeti that serves as her protector.
The haughty Keresta welcomes the characters to their doom and promises them a swift death. If asked about Lord Vanrak Moonstar or Umbraxakar, Keresta laughs and says that Shar's darkness consumes all things in the end.
If reduced to 0 hit points, Keresta turns to mist and retreats to her resting place in area 31 (via area 30). In mist form, she can pass through the cracks under doors and blend in with the fog to become effectively invisible.
The abominable yeti and the vampire spawn fight to the death to protect Keresta, as does Portia Dzuth (see area 25b) if she is present and still charmed by Keresta. The squad of vampire spawn is composed of adventurers and cultists who have been turned into undead by Keresta. Their names are Aryk, Bartho, Callia, Gaston, Hector, Ilsuban, Nath, Rhylzar, and Rose.
The parchment on the table is a map of Waterdeep, drained of color like everything else in this part of Vanrakdoom. A quill pen and several ink pots rest nearby. Two daggers stuck in the map mark the Spires of the Morning (the temple of Lathander in the Castle Ward) and the House of the Moon (the temple of Selûne in the Sea Ward). Written around them are the names of various clerics and paladins of Lathander and Selûne whom Keresta plans to assassinate.

## 27. Altars of Loss

This chamber contains two identical altars in alcoves. Each altar is sculpted from a single chunk of obsidian and inscribed with the following words in Common: "Memories are the shackles that bind us to the lost."

## 28. Forgotten Chambers

Each of these rooms is heavily obscured by fog and has low piles of dusty gray rubble along the walls.

## 28a. Hall of Centipedes

The walls and floor of this 20 -foot-high room bear carvings of centipedes. The room is otherwise empty.

## 28в. Empty Room

This 10 -foot-high room is vacant.

## 28c. Shadow Assassins

Three shadow assassins (see appendix A) lurk in the far corners of this 10 -foot-high room. When the door opens, they attack the first character to enter.

## 29. Foggy Hall

The floor of this room is heavily obscured by a 2 -foothigh blanket of thick fog. It swirls lazily around the base of a 20 -foot-diameter, cylindrical stone column that supports the 20 -foot-high ceiling. Rusty iron torch sconces mounted to this central column stand empty.

## 30. Path to the Tomb

Keresta uses this hallway to reach her tomb.

## 30a. SeCRET DOOR

A bas-relief mural covers the southwest wall of this 20 -foot-high room. The mural depicts Shar in the form of a young woman, her billowing cloak becoming one with the night sky as she descends upon unsuspecting human mourners in a graveyard. In each hand, she clutches a dagger. Characters who examine the mural closely and succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check notice four 1-inch-diameter holes bored into the gravestones. Keresta uses these holes to pass through the wall in mist form.
Secret Door. The entire southwest wall is a stone secret door that pivots on a central axis. The secret door is locked but can be opened with a knock spell or similar magic. It can also be forced open with a successful DC 30 Strength (Athletics) check.

## 30b. Hidden Hallway

This dusty, 20 -foot-high corridor is hidden behind two large secret doors. Rusty chains and manacles hang on the walls at 10 -foot intervals.

## 31. VAMPIRE'S TOMB

Sarcophagus. A lidless amethyst sarcophagus stands atop a 1 -foot-high stone bier near the south wall of this 30 -foot-high, vaulted chamber. An antipathy/sympathy spell protects the sarcophagus and tries to repel humanoids with its antipathy effect.
Mural. A 20 -foot-square bas-relief mural dominates the east wall and covers a secret door.

## Amethyst Sarcophagus

The sarcophagus is a Large object weighing 1,100 pounds. It has AC 17,80 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. It contains a bed of grave dirt upon which Keresta sleeps. If reduced to 0 hit points and allowed to retreat here in mist form, Keresta returns to this sarcophagus and remains here, paralyzed in vampire form for 1 hour. At the end of the hour, she regains 1 hit point and is no longer paralyzed. She waits here until her Regeneration trait returns her to full hit points, then gathers her forces (including Umbraxakar) and sets out to destroy any enemies still in Vanrakdoom.
Treasure. For every point of damage the sarcophagus takes, a piece of it breaks off. Each piece weighs 13 pounds and is worth 100 gp . Eighty pieces can be gathered if the sarcophagus is destroyed.

---

## Bas-Relief Mural

The mural depicts Lord Vanrak Moonstar as a skeletal death knight, riding on the back of Umbraxakar, the shadow dragon. Lying at the dragon's feet are piles of withered corpses with hideous shadows hovering over them. Characters who examine the mural closely and succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check notice four 1-inch-diameter holes bored into some of the corpses. Keresta uses these holes to pass through the wall in mist form.

Secret Door. The mural covers a stone secret door functionally identical to the one in area 30a.

## 32. Umbraxakar's LaIR

Umbraxakar the shadow dragon dwells here and cannot be surprised by the characters, whose presence he has sensed since they first stepped into the Shadowfell.

Characters who experienced the vision in area 17 recognize this hall as the same one seen in that vision. The hall contains the following:
Shadows. The 40 -foot-high vaulted ceiling is buttressed by eight stone columns, around which gather eleven shadows and four shadow assassins (see appendix A) under Umbraxakar's command. (These undead act immediately after the dragon in the initiative count.)
Dragon's Dais. To the south, stone steps climb 10 feet to a dais, where Umbraxakar is perched.
Statues. A double door at the back of the dais is flanked by two 20 -foot-tall, black marble statues, one depicting Shar as a cloaked woman wielding a dagger in each hand and the other showing Halaster Blackcloak clutching a staff. The statues glare at one another like mortal enemies.

## Shadow Dragon

Umbraxakar is a Huge adult bronze dragon with the shadow dragon template, which causes the following changes to his statistics:

- Umbraxakar is neutral evil.
- He has resistance to necrotic damage. While in dim light or darkness, he has resistance to all damage that isn't force, psychic, or radiant, and he can take the Hide action as a bonus action.
- His Stealth skill modifier is +10 .
- While in sunlight, he has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
- His Lightning Breath becomes Shadow Breath, dealing necrotic damage instead of lightning damage. A humanoid reduced to 0 hit points by this damage dies, and an undead shadow rises from its corpse and acts immediately after Umbraxakar in the initiative count. The shadow is under Umbraxakar's control.
Umbraxakar and the shadows under his command try to destroy intruders as quickly as possible, enabling the shadow dragon to revel in their misery rather than his own.

Umbraxakar's Despair. The dragon has spent more than a century lamenting the fall of Vanrak Moonstar, his friend. As the dragon ages and becomes more powerful, his despair causes Vanrakdoom to sink deeper
into the Shadowfell. Halaster has made no effort to prevent this from happening because it intrigues him to see part of Undermountain pulled away in such a manner. He's happy to let adventurers kill the dragon and return Umbraxakar's shadowy domain to Undermountain where it belongs.

Characters can try to turn Umbraxakar back into a bronze dragon by ending his despair and breaking Shar's hold over him. To accomplish this, they must present the shadow dragon with items he cherishes and succeed on three separate ability checks to lift his spirits (see below). If they fail more than one such check, they won't have enough gifts left to turn the shadow dragon back into a bronze dragon.

As an action, a character can give Umbraxakar a gift that holds emotional significance for the dragon. Four such items can be found in Vanrakdoom:

- Vanrak's polished coral ring in area 5 (a symbol of friendship)
- Vanrak's sun blade in area 8 (a symbol of light)
- Vanrak's mithral armor in area 15 (a symbol of preservation and resilience)
- The gold horn in area 17 (a symbol of guilt)

While gifting one of these items, the character must speak sympathetic words to the dragon and succeed on a DC 20 Charisma (Persuasion) check. Other characters can't help on this check; it is made with advantage, however, if the character claims to be an emissary of House Moonstar or refers to the dragon by his true name, Glyster. If the character tries to deceive the dragon in any way, replace the Persuasion check with a DC 20 Charisma (Deception) check. On a failed check, the dragon is not swayed by the characters' words but still keeps the gift.

With each successful check, the dragon becomes visibly more conflicted as moonlight magically flickers across his scales, making them appear more solid and less translucent. A character who sees this magical moonlight can sense, with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Insight) check, that it's of divine origin. (The moonlight is a blessing from Selûne, though there's no way for the characters to confirm this.)

Three successful checks are needed to rid the dragon of his despair, whereupon he dismisses any remaining undead under his command, causing them to vanish and never return. His spirits lifted by the characters' gifts and words, Umbraxakar changes back into an adult bronze dragon, returns the characters' gifts, and insists on being called Glyster henceforth. He offers to help the characters clear out the rest of Vanrakdoom as well as to explore deeper levels of Undermountain in the hope of finding a gate that he can use to escape from Undermountain. Glyster would like to take his collected treasures with him (see area 33) and offers the characters a few choice items if they help him transport the hoard.

Glyster is an archetypal bronze dragon who likes to assume a variety of humanoid and beast forms. For roleplaying guidance, see the "Bronze Dragon" entry in the Monster Manual.

---

## Out of the Shadowfell

If Umbraxakar dies or turns back into a bronze dragon, all areas of Vanrakdoom currently in the Shadowfell immediately return to the Material Plane and become subject to Undermountain's magic-altering effects (see "Alterations to Magic," page 10). The light-dimming effect of the Shadowfell is also lifted, and natural colors are restored, but the stench of death lingers (see "Into the Shadowfell," page 233). The fog encountered throughout Vanrakdoom is not a byproduct of Umbraxakar's despair and remains until Keresta is destroyed.

## 33. Dragon's Hoard

Altar and Rift. Above an altar of black stone in the middle of this 30 -foot-high vault floats a 10 -foot-tall, dag-ger-shaped rift of wispy shadow that moans.
Statues. Steps climb to alcoves in the north, west, and south walls. At the back of each alcove is a wooden statue with coins piled around its base.

## Altar and Extradimensional Rift

A detect magic spell reveals auras of conjuration magic around the altar and the moaning rift above it. If the altar comes in contact with bright light, four cloakers fly out of the rift and attack all other creatures in the room. Once the cloakers emerge, the rift stops moaning.
Altar. Inscriptions carved into the altar are written in a secret language known only to Shar's faithful. A comprehend languages spell or similar magic reveals that these inscriptions spell out the core tenets of Shar's faith:

- In darkness, act. Never wait for the darkness to pass before making your move.
- Quench the light of the moon when you can. Hide from it when you can't.
- Keep secrets from all except Shar's faithful.
- Only a fool believes in hope.

The altar is a Large object with AC 17, 50 hit points, vulnerability to radiant damage, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. If the altar is destroyed, the shadowy rift collapses, and any creatures trapped in the extradimensional prison beyond are released. They appear in random unoccupied spaces throughout the room.
Extradimensional Prison. Any creature that enters the rift's space is transported to an unoccupied space in an extradimensional prison that takes the form of a 30 -foot-diameter cave with no light sources and no exits. If the cloakers haven't been released, they attack any creature that appears in their prison.
Characters can escape the prison with a plane shift spell or similar magic. Destroying the altar also releases any trapped creatures, as described above.

## Statues and Treasure

The statues and their treasures are as follows:
North Statue. This painted wooden statue, 8 feet tall, depicts Keresta Delvingstone with her claws outstretched and her fangs bared. Around its neck, the statue wears a large ruby pendant on a gold chain ( 750 gp ), and draped over its shoulders is a cloak of the bat. Piled around the base are 13,700 sp.
South Statue. This wooden statue, 10 feet tall, depicts Umbraxakar in humanoid form, appearing as a muscular man with charcoal-colored skin, bronze-colored eyes, and dragon wings. Piled around the statue are $9,300 \mathrm{gp}$.
West Statue. This stone statue stands 9 feet tall and is painted jet black. It depicts Shar as a cloaked woman with a dagger in each hand. A character who searches the statue and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check discovers that one of its daggers is a lever that opens a compartment at the base of the statue. The compartment contains a rolled-up painting of Shar ( 250 gp ) and a vial containing 2 doses of midnight tears (see "Poisons" in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master's Guide). Piled around the statue's base are 22,150 ep.

## AFTERMATH

Destroying Keresta Delvingstone puts one last nail in the coffin of the cult of Shar. Any remaining cultists and vampire spawn disperse like rats fleeing a sinking ship. Several months later, the characters (if they're still alive) receive the deed to a run-down estate in Waterdeep worth $15,000 \mathrm{gp}$ along with an official property transfer notice signed by a magistrate and authorized by the Lords of Waterdeep.
Accompanying the deed is a brief letter written in human blood that thanks the characters for destroying Keresta Delvingstone, whom the letter's writer describes as a "thorn in my side for more than a century." The letter is signed with the initials "A.M."
Several Masked Lords of Waterdeep use every resource at their disposal to discourage and thwart investigations into the letter writer's identity. With enough luck and patience, however, characters might come to learn that "A.M." stands for Artor Morlin, the Baron of Blood, a powerful vampire who dwells in a dungeon complex under Waterdeep and can't abide other vampires preying on his city. The baron's presence is one of Waterdeep's most closely guarded secrets.
Freeing Umbraxakar from his curse completes a quest (see "Save the Dragon," page 9) and earns the characters the friendship of a powerful bronze dragon eager to leave Undermountain and return to his coastal lair, helping the characters as he goes.
Halaster doesn't mourn the loss of the shadow dragon or the cult of Shar. He simply cordons off large sections of Vanrakdoom until he can restock them with new monsters and traps.
