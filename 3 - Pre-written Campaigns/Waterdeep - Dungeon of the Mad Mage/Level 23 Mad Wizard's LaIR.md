# Level 23: Mad Wizard's LaIR

![img-43.jpeg](assets/Waterdeep%20-%20Dungeon%20of%20the%20Mad%20Mage_img-43.jpeg)

ALASTER MAKES HIS HOME IN THE LOWEST LEVEL of Undermountain, which is optimized for four characters of 17 th level or higher. Characters who defeat the monsters on this level should gain enough XP to reach 20th level.

## Who Dwells Here?

In addition to Halaster, two of the Mad Mage's apprentices reside on this level: Arcturia and Trobriand.

## Halaster Blackgloak

If the adventurers have made their way to this level, Halaster is equal parts impressed and curious. He is ready to grant the characters an audience, having kept an eye on their progress. True to the nature that earned him the moniker "Mad Mage," Halaster's demeanor toward the characters can change on a whim. He might alternate between seeming furious, baffled, annoyed, amused-or simply bored, depending on what the characters have accomplished before reaching this level. See appendix A for more information on the Mad Mage.
If the characters and their actions support Halaster's current goal (see "Halaster's Goals," page 11), the Mad Mage is not necessarily hostile. For example, if his primary goal is to find an apprentice, Halaster has kept an eye on any arcane spellcasters in the party. He might suggest that those characters prove their worth by surviving the Mad Wizard's Lair and "freeing up" an apprenticeship by eliminating Arcturia or Trobriand. If this is done, Halaster is willing to take on an appropriate
character as a new apprentice. Halaster has no sentimental attachment toward his apprentices, and he often enjoys secretly tormenting them.

## Arcturia

Arcturia is a lich and a master of transmutation magic. She has altered her form dramatically over the years, now appearing more alive than undead. Gossamer wings sprout from her shoulders, and bone spurs jut from her forearms and elbows.
If the characters destroyed her phylactery on level 14, Arcturia attacks them on sight. She has no beef with them otherwise.

## Trobriand the Metal Mage

Trobriand specializes in the creation of magical constructs. Characters who have passed through the upper levels might have encountered some of his creations.
Fed up with the frailty of the flesh, Trobriand has transferred his spirit into the body of a specially prepared iron golem. This merging of spirit and metal has done nothing to improve his sanity, however.

## The Dungeon

Locations in the dungeon portion of this level (areas 1 through 21) are keyed to map 23. No tunnels or staircases connect this dungeon complex to the upper levels of Undermountain. Characters arrive in area 1 after passing through a gate in Shadowdusk Hold (area 35 on level 22).

## 1. No Retreat

Arch. The north wall is set with a stone arch, its keystone bearing Halaster's visage whose animated eyes follow any creature that approaches the arch. Carved into the wall above the keystone is a sigil.
Statue. An alcove to the south contains a life-size, painted stone statue of Halaster perched atop a 4 -foottall granite plinth like a vulture, squatting with arms outstretched and fingers curled like talons, as though ready to leap down and claw at anyone who stands before it (see "Halaster Statue" below).
Frescoes. Six 10 -foot-square painted frescoes adorn the walls around the arch: two flanking the arch on the north wall, two side by side on the west wall, and two side by side on the east wall. Each fresco displays a magically animated image of Halaster performing one or more mundane activities: stretching and yawning, juggling rods, sweeping the floor with a broom, trying to escape from a straitjacket, doing handstands, and shadowboxing.
Secret Door. Hidden behind the fresco that depicts Halaster stretching and yawning is a secret door.
Targeting an animated fresco with a dispel magic spell has no effect other than to cause Halaster's image to silently mock the spell's caster. The images become motionless while in the area of an antimagic field.

## Arch Gate to Level 22

The sigil inscribed above the arch is Halaster's personal rune. Both it and the face carved into the keystone are harmless.
Halaster can open the gate for 1 minute by touching the arch. The gate cannot otherwise be opened from this side. A creature that passes through the gate appears in area 35 on level 22, in the closest unoccupied space next to the gate located there.

## Halaster Statue

Anytime a creature other than Halaster tries to cast a spell in this room, the statue's arms animate and perform the quick series of somatic gestures needed to cast counterspell. After casting its spell, the statue reverts to its inanimate state until triggered again. The counterspell attempt succeeds automatically.
The statue is a Large object with AC 17, 50 hit points, and immunity to all damage except force damage. The statue falls to pieces and loses its spellcasting ability if it is reduced to 0 hit points. Destroying the statue triggers a magic mouth spell; the mouth appears amid the shattered remains and says, "Is this the end of Halaster Blackcloak? Ha! I think not."

## 2. Reversed Library

Everything in this room is upside down because gravity in the room is magically reversed. The room is furnished thusly:
Bookshelves. The walls are lined with upside-down bookshelves, fully stocked with upside-down history books from the many parts of the world Halaster has explored.

Desk. In the middle of the 15 -foot-high ceiling is an upside-down desk topped with a stack of tomes held between two golden, upside-down bookends shaped like bulettes bursting out of the ground.
The reverse gravity field can't be negated, though it is suppressed within an antimagic field. Unless anchored, held down, or affected by a fly spell or similar magic, any creature or object that enters this room falls up toward the ceiling.
The desk is empty except for the array of nine books held between the bulette-shaped bookends. Eight of the books contain essays pertaining to the eight schools of magic, one book dedicated to each school. The cover and the pages of the ninth book appear blank.
Placing the other books in alphabetical order by school of magic between the bookends causes Halaster's rune to appear on the cover of the ninth book and spells to appear on its pages. This tome is one of Halaster's spellbooks (see "Treasure" below).

## Treasure

The gold bookends are worth 500 gp for the pair, while the eight books detailing the schools of magic are worth 100 gp each.
Halaster's spellbook contains the following spells: Bigby's hand, color spray, crown of madness, enlarge/ reduce, fabricate, false life, gaseous form, gust of wind, hold monster, ice storm, jump, maze, Otto's irresistible dance, reverse gravity, sleet storm, and weird.

## 3. Talking Heads

This 10 -foot-high room has wooden shelves covering the walls from floor to ceiling. Hundreds of wide-mouthed jars line the shelves, each containing a severed head floating in brine.
The heads in the jars are specimens that Halaster has collected throughout Undermountain: goblins, drow, kuo-toa, duergar, troglodytes, githyanki, mind flayers, and other creatures. Although detached from their bodies, the heads remain alive and sedate as a result of Halaster's magic. Tapping on a jar is enough to stir a head to consciousness. The heads speak only the languages they knew in life and have no recollection of how they ended up in their disembodied state. A character can prompt a head for information, which it's happy to provide. Each head shares one Undermountain secret determined by drawing a card from the Secrets Deck (see appendix C). A head can also confirm that Halaster spends a lot of time on this level of Undermountain.
Removing a head from a jar or removing a jar from this room ends the magic that animates the head, which immediately dies.

## 4. Helmed Horrors

Six helmed horrors float in the alcoves marked H on map 23. These constructs attack intruders on sight and fly after those who flee.
