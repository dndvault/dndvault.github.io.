## LEGENDARY ACTIONS

Muiral can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Muiral regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

Retreating Strike (Costs 3 Actions). Muiral moves up to his speed without provoking opportunity attacks. Before the move, he can make one longsword attack.

## MUIRAL

Muiral was an accomplished human warrior who long served as Halaster's bodyguard. His descent into madness began when he asked the Mad Mage to tutor him in the wizardly arts. Muiral learned enough magic to transform himself into a half-scorpion monstrosity, becoming known as Muiral the Misshapen. He then retired to the level of Undermountain that would later be called Muiral's Gauntlet, driving out and slaying its original drow denizens. Muiral now spends his days hunting adventurers and other interlopers for fun. Long years alone-and Halaster's influence-have rendered him utterly insane.

## NeOTHELID

When an illithid colony's tadpoles are no longer fed by their caretakers, they turn to devouring one another out of hunger. Only one tadpole survives out of the thousands in the colony's pool, and it emerges as a neothe-lid-a slime-covered worm of immense size.

A feral thing, a neothelial knows nothing beyond the predatory existence it has lived so far. It prowls subterranean passages in search of more brains to sate its constant hunger, growing ever more vicious.

Creature Sense. The neothelial is aware of the presence of creatures within 1 mile of it that have an Intelligence score of 4 or higher. It knows the distance and direction to each creature, as well as each creature's Intelligence score, but can't sense anything else about it. A creature protected by a mind blank spell, a nondetection spell, or similar magic can't be perceived in this manner.

Innate Spellcasting (Psionics). The neothelial's innate spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 16). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no components:

At will: levitate
1/day each: confusion, feeblemind, telekinesis
Magic Resistance. The neothelial has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

## ACTIONS

Tentacles. Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 15 ft ., one target. Hit: $21(3 d 8+8)$ bludgeoning damage plus 13 (3d8) psychic damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be swallowed by the neothelial. A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the neothelial, and it takes 35 (10d6) acid damage at the start of each of the neothelial's turns.

If the neothelial takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the neothelial must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the neothelial. If the neothelial dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 20 feet of movement, exiting prone.

Acid Breath (Recharge 5-6). The neothelial exhales acid in a 60foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 35 (10d6) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

## SCALADAR

Scaladar are constructs created by Trobriand, one of Halaster's apprentices. They move and attack like giant scorpions, grabbing prey with two large pincer claws and delivering a deadly pulse of lightning with their metal stinger tails.

Trobriand's Rings. Trobriand crafted magic rings to control the scaladar. Each ring is a black metal loop with a stinger-shaped protrusion. No scaladar can harm the wearer of such a ring, and any scaladar within 100 feet of a ring wearer must obey its spoken commands. The magic of the ring enables the scaladar to understand and interpret these commands, even though the creatures have no language of their own. If given contradictory commands from two different ring wearers, a scaladar immediately shuts down and becomes incapacitated for 1 hour. Trobriand has a master ring that lets him override the commands of other ring wearers without causing a scaladar to shut down. Trobriand's rings function only in Undermountain.

Constructed Nature. A scaladar doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

Lightning Absorption. Whenever the scaladar is subjected to lightning damage, it takes no damage, and its sting deals an extra 11 (2d10) lightning damage until the end of its next turn.

Scaladar Link. The scaladar knows the location of other scaladar within 100 feet of it, and it can sense when any of them take damage.

## ACTIONS

Multiattack. The scaladar makes three attacks: two with its claws and one with its sting.

Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft ., one target. Hit: $10(1 \mathrm{~d} 12+4)$ bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 15). The scaladar has two claws, each of which can grapple one target.

## ShADOW Assassin

A shadow assassin looks like an undead shadow (as described in the Monster Manual) that wields shortswords also made of shadow. It exists only to slay the living.
Undead Nature. A shadow assassin doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

## Ulitharid

Very rarely, an illithid tadpole transforms an individual into an ulitharid rather than an ordinary mind flayer. Ulitharids are larger than mind flayers and have six tentacles instead of four. Illithids innately recognize that an ulitharid's survival is more important than their own. In most colonies, an ulitharid becomes an elder brain's most favored servant, invested with power and authority. In others, the elder brain perceives the ulitharid as a potential rival, manipulating or quashing the ulitharid's ambitions accordingly.

Shadow Blade. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft ., one target. Hit: $7(1 \mathrm{~d} 6+4)$ piercing damage plus $10(3 \mathrm{~d} 6)$ necrotic damage. Unless the target is immune to necrotic damage, the target's Strength score is reduced by 1d4 each time it is hit by this attack. The target dies if its Strength is reduced to 0 . The reduction lasts until the target finishes a short or long rest.
If a non-evil humanoid dies from this attack, a shadow (see the Monster Manual) rises from the corpse 1d4 hours later.

Senses darkvision 120 ft ., passive Perception 18
Languages Deep Speech, Undercommon, telepathy 2 miles Challenge $9(5,000 \mathrm{XP})$

Creature Sense. The ulitharid is aware of the presence of creatures within 2 miles of it that have an Intelligence score of 4 or higher. It knows the distance and direction to each creature, as well as each creature's Intelligence score, but can't sense anything else about it. A creature protected by a mind blank spell, a nondetection spell, or similar magic can't be perceived in this manner.

Magic Resistance. The ulitharid has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

Psionic Hub. If an elder brain establishes a psychic link with the ulitharid, the elder brain can form a psychic link with any other creature the ulitharid can detect using its Creature Sense. Any such link ends if the creature falls outside the telepathy ranges of both the ulitharid and the elder brain. The ulitharid can maintain its psychic link with the elder brain regardless of the distance between them, as long as they are both on the same plane of existence. If the ulitharid is more than 5 miles away from the elder brain, it can end the psychic link at any time (no action required).

Innate Spellcasting (Psionics). The ulitharid's innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 17). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no components:

At will: detect thoughts, levitate
1/day each: confusion, dominate monster, eyebite, feeblemind, mass suggestion, plane shift (self only), project image, scrying, telekinesis

## ACTIONS

Tentacles. Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft ., one creature. Hit: $27(4 \mathrm{~d} 10+5)$ psychic damage. If the target is Large or smaller, it is grappled (escape DC 14) and must succeed on a DC 17 Intelligence saving throw or be stunned until this grapple ends.

Extract Brain. Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft ., one incapacitated humanoid grappled by the ulitharid. Hit: 55 (10d10) piercing damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the ulitharid kills the target by extracting and devouring its brain.

Mind Blast (Recharge 5-6). The ulitharid magically emits psychic energy in a 60 -foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 17 Intelligence saving throw or take 31 (4d12 +5 ) psychic damage and be stunned for 1 minute. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

---

When an ulitharid finds sharing leadership with an elder brain to be insufferable, it breaks off from the colony, taking a group of mind flayers with it, and forms a new colony. After the death of the ulitharid's body, mind flayers place its brain in a brine pool, where it grows into an elder brain over a few days.

Extractor Staff. Each ulitharid carries a psonically enhanced staff made of black metal. When the ulitharid is ready to give up its body, it attaches the staff to the back of its head and uses the staff to crack open its own skull and peel it apart, enabling its brain to be extracted and placed in a brine pool, where it can grow into an elder brain. The staff serves no other purpose.

## WEREBAT

A werebat is a humanoid afflicted with a rare form of lycanthropy that enables it to transform into a giant bat or a bat-humanoid hybrid. (See the Monster Manual for more information on lycanthropy.) Most werebats are of goblin stock.

Deep Dwellers. Werebats are shunned even by goblin society because of their need to feed on blood to survive. They prefer to lair in dark places, such as attics and caves, and typically adopt nocturnal hunting habits.

Blood Drinkers. A werebat must consume at least 1 pint of fresh blood each night, or it weakens and gains one level of exhaustion that no amount of rest alone can remove. Each pint of blood the werebat consumes removes one level of exhaustion gained in this fashion.

Werebat Lycanthropy. A player character who becomes a werebat gains a Dexterity of 17 if their score isn't already higher. Attack and damage rolls for the werebat's bite attack are based on the character's Strength or Dexterity score, whichever is higher.

## WEREBAT

Nimble Escape (Humanoid Form Only). The werebat can take the Disengage or Hide action as a bonus action on each of its turns.

Sunlight Sensitivity. While in sunlight, the werebat has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

## Actions

Multiattack (Humanoid or Hybrid Form Only). In humanoid form, the werebat makes two scimitar attacks or two shortbow attacks. In hybrid form, it can make one bite attack and one scimitar attack.

Bite (Bat or Hybrid Form Only). Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach $5 \mathrm{ft}$. , one creature. Hit: $6(1 \mathrm{~d} 6+3)$ piercing damage, and the werebat gains temporary hit points equal to the damage dealt. If the target is a humanoid, it must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with werebat lycanthropy.

Scimitar (Humanoid or Hybrid Form Only). Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft ., one target. Hit: $6(1 \mathrm{~d} 6+3)$ slashing damage.

Shortbow (Humanoid or Hybrid Form Only). Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. Hit: $6(1 \mathrm{~d} 6+3)$ piercing damage.
