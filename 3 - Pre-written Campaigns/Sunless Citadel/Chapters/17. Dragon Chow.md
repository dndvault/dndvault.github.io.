# 17. Dragon Chow

A character who approaches the door can smell the stench of what lies beyond. If the door is opened, read:

Rats fill the room, trapped among their own waste. A small half-barrier prevents the rats from easily escaping when the door is open.

Creatures. The rats are used as food for the dragon wyrmling that was once stabled in area 15 . Since the abduction of the dragon, the kobolds have neglected the rats, and in the meantime the rodents have chewed away the fastenings of the barrier. One round after someone opens the door, the rats knock the barrier over and rush out, attacking as a swarm of rats for 1 round, after which they disperse into the dungeon.
