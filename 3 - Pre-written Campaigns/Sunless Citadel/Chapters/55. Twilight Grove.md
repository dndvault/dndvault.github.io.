# 55. Twilight Grove

Pale, spindly briars press close, casting twisted shadows on the earth floor in the violet light.

Briars. The most successful aboveground plants that Belak has transplanted in the Twilight Grove are the briars, though they appear sickly and pale, with blighted leaves. Other common plants and bushes are also represented, though they are equally afflicted.
The briars don't hinder Small and smaller creatures. Larger creatures must either spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot moved or make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw for every 10 feet moved. On a failed save, the creature takes 1 piercing damage from the briars.
A 5 -foot-by-5-foot area of briars can be cleared if it takes 20 damage of any type other than psychic.

Creatures. Ten twig blights, less any that were dispatched in area 54, are spread about the grove. After moving 50 feet into the cavern, the characters come upon 1d4 of the hostile creatures. Any significant noise, such as from combat or clearing the briars, also attracts $1 \mathrm{~d} 4-1$ twig blights (minimum 0 ) each round.
Development. If the characters get to area 56 before all the twig blights have engaged, the rest of the monsters hold off their attacks. Any conflict that involves yelling in a language other than Goblin, the use of flashy magical effects, or similar noticeable elements alerts Belak in area 56 to the approach of invaders.
