# 49. Arboretums

Luminescent mist blurs the edges of this octagonal chamber. Nodules of glowing fungus dot the stone walls and ceiling, as well as the caps of toadstools and mushrooms, small polyps, puffballs, and lichen. The humid air reeks with rot.

The arboretums hold small samples of traditional Underdark ecosystems, which aren't difficult for Belak to nurture. The stone doors leading to them are unlocked.

Southern Arboretum. A goblin and three goblin commoners gather fungus for use in area 47.

Southeast Arboretum. Several growths in the chamber are scorched and dead. Fungus shrouds holes similar to those found in area 45, and a fire snake lurks inside one of these openings. It emerges if anyone pokes into or closely examines the holes. If the snake comes out, a character who reaches into the snake's burrow can recover two sapphires (worth 50 gp each).

Northeast Arboretum. Three skeletons-AC 12, 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage with shovels or rakes-are at work, clearing scorched plants. One twig blight, which is hostile to the adventurers, is with them. The skeletons attack anything the twig blight attacks.

Fungus shrouds holes similar to those in area 45.
Northern Arboretum. The northern room contains only its plants.
