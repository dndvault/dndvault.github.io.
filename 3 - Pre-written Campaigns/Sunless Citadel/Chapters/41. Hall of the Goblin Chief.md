# 41. Hall of the Goblin Chief

If the goblinoid guards in the chief's hall have been alerted, or if they hear conflict in area 40, they cover the door for 10 minutes, then investigate the source of the disruptions at their leader's behest.

A circular shaft pierces the floor of this forty-foot-diameter domed chamber. Dim violet light shines out of the shaft, revealing sickly white and gray vines that coat the walls of the shaft. The light is supplemented by four lit wall torches set equidistant around the periphery of the chamber. A crudely fashioned stone throne sits against the curve of the northwestern wall. A large iron chest serves as the throne's footstool. A sapling grows in a wide stone pot next to the throne.

Creatures. The chief of the Durbuluk tribe is Durnn, a hobgoblin. He wears splint armor (AC 19) and has 18 hit points, a +4 bonus to hit, a +1 bonus to damage, and Strength $15(+2)$. These changes raise his challenge rating to $1(200 \mathrm{XP})$. When not in combat, Durnn sits on the throne, and three other hobgoblins stand nearby or lounge on stone benches.
The shaman Grenl advises the chief. She is a goblin with 10 (3d6) hit points, a Wisdom of $13(+1)$, and the following trait:
Spellcasting. Grenl is a 1st-level spellcaster. Her spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 11, +3 to hit with spell attacks). She has the following cleric spells prepared:

Cantrips (at will): poison spray, thaumaturgy
1st level (2 slots): bane, inflict wounds
A twig blight, a gift from Belak the Outcast and a pet of Durnn's, is in the stone pot, and goblins from area 40
occasionally enter the chamber to see to the needs of the tribe's elite that languish here.
Development. Durnn has a potion of healing and two vials of antitoxin. Grenl has a spell scroll of faerie fire and another of expeditious retreat.
The goblins in area 40 don't join the battle if they hear sounds of violence coming from the north. If the fight turns against the chief, however, he might open the door to area 40 and call for aid, or withdraw to area 40 to continue the fight.
Durnn can't surrender for fear of losing face. He won't give up if the opposition includes kobolds. Otherwise, he might call for parley if doing so allows him to avoid death. But he must still look strong while negotiating, so he's unwilling to capitulate in an arrangement that makes him look weak.
Because Durnn and his hobgoblins usurped control of the Durbuluk tribe, Grenl hates them. She also wants to protect her tribe, so she is willing to negotiate a truce if Durnn falls. Grenl also hates and envies Belak, and she wants him gone from the citadel so she can control the Gulthias Tree.
If captured and interrogated, the goblinoids here know what Erky in area 34 knows, with the following addition: Belak wanted all the living human prisoners sent down to him, but in a fit of anger, Durnn slew Talgen. Thus, Durnn sent only Sharwyn and Sir Braford down to the Twilight Grove.
Shaft. The shaft has a 2 -foot wall around it, much like the upper end of a well. Because of the wall, a creature pushed toward the shaft can avoid going over the edge by falling prone and succeeding on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. Thick, pale vines line the shaft. The vines are as good as knotted rope for the purpose of climbing.
A creature that falls into the shaft can make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw to catch the vines. On a failed save, the creature falls 80 feet to the floor of area 42.
Trapped Chest. Durnn's iron chest rests in front of the throne. It is locked (Dexterity DC 15 using thieves' tools) and trapped with a poisoned needle. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check deduces the trap's presence from alterations made to the lock. A character can then remove the needle from the lock by succeeding on a DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools. On a failed Dexterity check, the trap is triggered.
When the trap is triggered, the needle extends 3 inches straight out from the lock. A creature within striking distance takes 1 piercing damage and must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take 3 (1d6) poison damage.
Treasure. In addition to the valuables mentioned in the "Development" section, Durnn wears Talgen's gold signet ring (worth 20 gp ) and splint armor, which is identifiable by the Hucrele family crest worked into the chest pieces. The chief also has the key to his iron chest. Grenl has keys to areas 34 and 37 . One of the other hobgoblins wears silver earrings set with moonstones ( 20 gp each), and another wears a matching necklace ( 50 gp ).
Inside Durnn's iron chest are 231 gp and two onyx gems ( 30 gp each).
