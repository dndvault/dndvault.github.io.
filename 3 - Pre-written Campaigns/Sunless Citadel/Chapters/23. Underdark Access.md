# 23. Underdark Access

The floor is partially collapsed on the east side of this room, revealing a tunnel. The passage is unworked, and it fluctuates widely in width, height, and direction as natural tunnels do. Within the room, hunting gear is racked on the wall, and several pallets lie nearby.

The kobolds used the natural passage to first enter the Sunless Citadel, and they continue to travel through it for hunting and gathering forays into the Underdark.
The tunnel leads beyond the scope of this adventure, but it could be a route to a site you have designed.
Creatures. If they have not come forth as reinforcements, three kobolds camp here, serving as hunters and guardians of the tunnel. They react as described in area 16.
