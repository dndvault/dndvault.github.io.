# 25. Empty Chamber

Two empty chambers in the eastern end of the fortress have the same characteristics.

This empty chamber is home only to rat droppings, crumbled flagstone, and stains.

Investigating. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check notices tracks in the dust. Some tracks were made by rats and some by humanoids. A character who then succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) check ascertains that the rat tracks are very recent, maybe a day old, and that the humanoid tracks are almost a month old and were made by three or four human-sized humanoids moving across the area to the north.

Trap. The door that connects the northernmost empty chamber with area 31 contains a trap. See area 31 for more details.
