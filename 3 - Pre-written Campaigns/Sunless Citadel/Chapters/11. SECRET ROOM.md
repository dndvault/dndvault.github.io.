# 11. SECRET ROOM

Dust coats the contents of this tiny chamber, obscuring runes inscribed on the southern wall.

Inscription. If the southern wall is cleared of dust, the runes are revealed to be a message in Draconic. Someone who can read the language understands it as "A dragonpriest entombed alive for transgressions of the Law still retains the honor of his position."

Secret Door. A secret trapdoor in the floor requires a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check to find. The door opens by pulling it upward. It leads to a 3 -foot-by-3-foot crawl space that connects to a similar trapdoor in area 12.
