# 32. Goblin Gate

The filth on the floor, stains on the walls, shabby hides, and firepit attest to the years of use this room has seen at the hands of creatures unconcerned with hygiene. On the eastern side of the southern wall is a crudely mortared half-wall, complete with crenellations.

Creatures. Two goblins are stationed behind the rough, 3 -foot-high wall. They are hostile to intruders, but unwilling to die facing a superior force. If captured, these goblins know the same information that Erky Timbers in area 34 does.
Development. If one of the goblins gets away, it warns the goblins in area 33. The alerted goblins prepare an ambush for intruders in that area.
Investigating. A search of the room turns up putrid jerky, vinegary wine in poorly preserved water skins, and other worthless bits of clutter.
