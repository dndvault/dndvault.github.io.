# 42. Central Garden

Luminescent fungus, shedding violet light, clings to the walls and ceiling of this wide cavern. The air is damp, chilly, and redolent with the odors of loam and decay. A layer of earth, mixed with rotting vegetation and the remains of cave animals, covers the floor. Several varieties of mushrooms and fungi grow on the detritus, as well as a few saplings.

Creatures. Two robed skeletons (AC 12) serve Belak by tending a fungus garden, using shovels and a rusted wheelbarrow to turn the soil and spread compost. In addition, two mature twig blights are rooted in the garden. The twig blights ambush intruders that aren't goblinoids, and the skeletons attack (with shovels, 1d6 bludgeoning damage) anything that the twig blights target.
Development. The creatures in area 43 investigate any disturbance in the garden after 3 rounds.
