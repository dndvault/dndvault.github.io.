# 31. Caltrop Hall

The door that leads north into this hallway is closed and fitted with a bell that clangs if someone opens the door without doing so very slowly.
With a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, someone who carefully opens the door might spot the bell attached to the door about 3 feet off the ground. A character who examines the space around the door before opening it and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check notices the damage done to the door when the goblins fastened the bell to it.
If the bell rings, the noise alerts the goblins in area 32. They duck behind the low wall and wait to ambush intruders that enter the corridor.

The ten-foot-wide hall is liberally strewn with sharp caltrops. On the northern wall, passage to the room beyond is partially blocked by a roughly mortared, three-foothigh wall, complete with crenellations.

Caltrops. The floor in the hallway is strewn with caltrops; see "Adventuring Gear" in chapter 5 of the Player's Handbook.

Creatures. Two goblins in area 32 pop up over the wall if they are alerted to the characters' presence. The creatures use ranged attacks as the characters move through the hall.

Treasure. About two hundred caltrops are strewn on the floor.
