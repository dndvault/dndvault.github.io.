# 36. Goblin Bandits

Three rooms in the northern part of the fortress serve as living quarters for goblin bandits. All have the same characteristics.

The stench, garbage, and carrion here are evidence of years of use by unsanitary tenants. Tattered hides stretched on frames form six unstable hammocks around a much-used firepit. Battered cooking equipment is mixed indiscriminately with broken or worn arms and armor.

Creatures. Three goblins, who proudly call themselves bandits, are in the room when the characters enter. In better times, two or more bandit groups would
hunt the Old Road together, preying on travelers. Now, the bandits content themselves with an occasional hunt in the wilds of the Underdark (see area 43), as well as preying on the kobolds.

Development. The goblins might try to knock the characters unconscious and imprison them in area 34 , locking victims into manacles. They take captured equipment to the goblin chief in area 41 . The bandits are likely to try to ransom the prisoners to someone in Oakhurst. Kerowyn Hucrele is prepared to pay such a ransom, taking it out of the characters' prospective reward.

If things go badly for the goblins, one of them attempts to warn the goblin warriors in area 39.

Investigating. A search of the room turns up putrid jerky, vinegary wine in poorly preserved water skins, and worthless bits of clutter.
