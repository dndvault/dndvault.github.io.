# 2. Switchback Stairs

The 5 -foot-wide stairs that descend from area 1 are roughly carved. They aren't dangerous to traverse, however, except that combat while on the narrow path can be risky. Three small landings lie along the route, the first at 60 feet above the floor in area 3 , the second at 40 feet, and the third at 20 feet.

The characters might be able to see area 3 as they descend.

A fortress emerges from the darkness. The subterranean citadel, though impressive, seems long forgotten, if the lightless windows,cracked crenellations, and leaning towers are any indication. All is quiet, though a cold breeze blows up from below, bringing with it the scent of dust and a faint trace of rot.
