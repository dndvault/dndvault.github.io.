# 33. Practice Range

The sound of goblins engaged in target practice might be heard from outside any of the doors to the practice range.

Dozens of blunted and broken arrows lie on the cracked cobblestone floor, and a few protrude from three crudely sewn, human-sized targets hung along the center of the south wall. The northern third of the room is separated from the south by a crudely mortared and crenellated half-wall. A permanent camp of sorts lies north of the wall, complete with a fire ring and several small iron cook pots.

Creatures. The three goblins assigned to watch the room spend some of their time shooting at the hair-and-fur-filled burlap dummies that look vaguely like humans and elves. The rest of the time they drink too much goblin wine.
When fighting, the goblins try to use the 3 -foot-high wall for cover while shooting their foes.

Treasure. One goblin has a silver flask of dwarven make (worth 50 gp ) filled with vile goblin wine. Another goblin has a key to open the locked door to area 34.
Development. If things go badly for the goblins, one of them attempts to warn the goblin warriors in area 39.
