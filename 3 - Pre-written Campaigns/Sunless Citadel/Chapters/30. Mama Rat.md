# 30. Mama Rat

An oppressive smell suffuses the air, rising from chewed carcasses of cave rats, smaller vermin, and a few human-oid-looking creatures. The bodies lie upon a floor of filth, old bones, hair, and fur that combine to make a particularly large and vile nest.

Investigating. The humanoid corpses in the chamber include two goblins, a kobold, and one human male-a member of the lost adventuring party (Karakas the ranger).

Creatures. Three giant rats occupy the area, along with a monstrously swollen female diseased giant rat (Medium [ 6 feet long], 16 hit points, +5 to hit, challenge rating $1 / 4[50 \mathrm{XP}]$ ) that the goblins call Guthash (Bloated One). The giant rats that hunt in the Sunless Citadel all descend from her. These creatures attack and attempt to eat all trespassers.

Treasure. Poking through the refuse over a period of 10 minutes uncovers $312 \mathrm{sp}, 68 \mathrm{gp}$, and 3 gems (worth 25 gp each). On and around the ranger's corpse are several items: studded leather armor, five daggers, a longbow, a backpack (containing a water skin, one day's rations, a bedroll, a tinderbox, and three torches), a quiver with six arrows, a potion of healing, and a pouch that holds 17 gp . A gold ring (worth 10 gp ) on Karakas's finger is engraved (in Common) with his name.
