# 8. Pressure Plate

The air is stale in this twenty-foot-long corridor, which leads to another closed stone door.

Arrow Trap. Each time any weight is placed on any part of the center 10 -foot-square section of the corridor, a mechanical pressure plate is activated, triggering a trap. An arrow fires from above the western door at the creature who triggered the trap: +5 to hit, $5(1 \mathrm{~d} 10)$ piercing damage.
With a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check, a character can deduce the presence of the pressure plate from variations in the mortar and stone around it, compared to the surrounding floor. Wedging an iron spike or some other similarly sized and sturdy object under the pressure plate prevents it from activating.
