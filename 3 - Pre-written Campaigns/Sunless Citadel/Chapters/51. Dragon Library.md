# 51. Dragon Library

Leaning and fallen stone bookshelves fill this chamber, though a clear path connects wooden doors on opposite walls. Torn and burnt pages, bindings, and scrolls form disordered piles in the corners.

Treasure. Rooting around in the wreckage, separate successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) checks uncover a spell scroll of scorching ray, a spell scroll of Melf's acid arrow, and a tome of dragon lore bound in dragon scale and written in Draconic (worth 150 gp ).
