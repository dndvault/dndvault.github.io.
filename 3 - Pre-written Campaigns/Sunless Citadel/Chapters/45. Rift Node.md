# 45. Rift Node

The rift widens, creating a cavern-like chamber. Small, two-foot-diameter holes riddle the node. A dim fiery glow shines out of one such hole.

Creature. In the glowing hall rests a fire snake. Belak used magic to call the creature forth and hopes to train it to be a loyal servant before it matures.
Treasure. Belak has already appealed to the snake's greed with a small gift. In its nest, the adventurers find two sapphires (worth 50 gp each).
