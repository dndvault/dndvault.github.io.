## Infinite Staircase Encounters

The Infinite Staircase Encounters table presents random encounters and interactions adventurers might have while traversing the Infinite Staircase.

## Infinite Staircase Encounters

d100 Encounter
01-07 An empyrean ascends the staircase to a goodly realm. Flowers sprout from the steps behind it as it walks. The empyrean waves politely at the party.
08-14 A section of the staircase ahead is covered in shadowy webbing. The hazard is the Iron Shadow manifesting as a memory web (see appendix B).
15-21 Three aarakocra return to the Censer of Dreams (detailed later in this chapter) from a faraway plane. The friendly avian travelers invite the characters to accompany them back to the palace.
22-28 Melvin Manyroads (chaotic good, gnome mage), a planar cartographer, stops to ask the characters if they've seen a particular door on the staircase.
29-35 1d4 + 1 bearded devils look for a door that leads behind enemy lines of the Blood War, the eternal conflict between demons and devils.
36-42 A stubborn dwarf commoner bumps into the characters. He's been wandering the staircase for decades but won't admit he's lost.
43-49 A masked deva loyal to Sel√ªne offers to guide the characters to a door of their choosing. The angel plays melodies on its harp during the journey.
50-56 An aspect of the Iron Shadow, a young red shadow dragon, rises from a staircase shrouded in dusk to confront the characters.
57-63 Inky tendrils writhe from a fleshy door to the Far Realm. Two githyanki warriors struggle to hold the door shut. They call out to the party for aid.
64-70 A lost unit of the Great Modron March consisting of 1d8 duodrones and 1d6 tridrones proceeds down the staircase, cataloging its every door.
71-77 The staircase ahead disappears into a 60 -foot cube of gloom created by the Iron Shadow (see the "Palls of Gloom" section).
78-84 A mastiff that wandered through a portal trots up to the party. It drops a stick in front of one of the characters and wags its tail eagerly.
85-91 A merrow happens on the staircase, flooding it with a deluge of water from an aquatic plane.
92-98 A nearby door to the Abyss flings open, releasing a hostile swarm of gibberlings (see appendix B).
99-00 A staircase of pure light materializes before one of the characters, beckoning them to the destination of their heart's desire. If the path is refused, it vanishes and never appears to them again.

## Nafas

Once there was everything, and once there was nothing but air. Then came a breath-a collective sigh exhaled by every plane and every world in one ephemeral gust. Multiversal winds blew into the Infinite Staircase through its doors, coalescing into Nafas (na-FASS), a noble genie infused with cosmic potential.
Nafas is detailed in the following sections and in appendix B.

## Breath of the Multiverse

Wisps of twinkling multiversal dust trail Nafas wherever he goes, evidence of the djinni's deep connection to the planes that bore him. Calm, clement, and dressed in billowing fabrics, he drifts along the staircase like a zephyr, admiring its portals and the curious creatures that emerge from them.
Nafas isn't the creator of the Infinite Staircase or its ruler. He doesn't control the staircase or its doors, and he holds no sway over their destinations or who may enter through them. The djinni is a product of the multiverse, a distant observer bound to the realm by the circumstances of his creation.
An unwritten law dictates that there must always be a noble genie to watch over the Infinite Staircase. As a result, Nafas can never leave it. Any attempt to forcibly remove him from the Infinite Staircase, whether by magical means or otherwise, fails.

## Cosmic Storyteller

Nafas is a gifted storyteller and a gracious host. He regales visitors to his palace (detailed later in this chapter) with tales of longing that could soften steel and legends of triumph that chase grief from sorrow-laden hearts. Truth threads each captivating story, woven by Nafas from the whims of creatures throughout the multiverse. Carried on the winds, their spoken desires converge in his splendid halls.
Nafas has as many years behind him as the staircase has doors. Seemingly immortal, the djinni has collected and recited countless tales. Some fables repeated throughout the planes are inspired by these true accounts-or corruptions of stories still yet to be resolved-told to travelers who crossed paths with Nafas.

## Noble Genie

Nafas is a noble genie, a rare type of genie endowed with the power to reshape reality. A word uttered by Nafas can transform a pauper into a prince, return the dead to life, or bring a meteor's might crashing down on his enemies. Unlike some of his more haughty, aristocratic counterparts that rule over vast demesnes of the Elemental Planes, Nafas's noble title isn't a result of bloodline or inheritance; it's a designation bestowed on him by the multiverse.

---

As a noble genie, Nafas can grant wishes, a power he doesn't take lightly. The djinni reserves his wish-granting magic for those he deems worthy. When Nafas does grant a wish-the greatest gift the djinni can give-he doesn't twist the benefactor's words or maliciously interpret their intentions, but his circumstances prevent him from freely conferring such gifts to deserving recipients outside the staircase.
Moved by the whims of yearning creatures on other planes but trapped within the Infinite Staircase, Nafas relies on adventurers to fulfill the wishes of those beyond the staircase's infinite thresholds. The djinni knows every door on the staircase and its destination, along with the origin of any wish that escapes through a door's seams.

## SeEking Wishes

Characters might seek out the djinni to end a lasting effect, resurrect a fallen character, or solve an unsolvable problem. The following are some obstacles that Nafas can wish away:

- Destroying or unmaking a magic item
- Learning the true name of a powerful enemy, such as an angel, an archfey, a demon, or a devil
- Restoring a creature to life
- Undoing a debilitating effect, like being transformed into a tree by a barkburr (see appendix B)


## Wishes from the Infinite Staircase

Nafas might act as a patron who hires the characters to undertake the adventures in this book. Each adventure includes a "Using the Infinite Staircase" section that frames its central plot as a wish heard by Nafas.
The djinni or one of his messengers-such as a friendly dust mephit formed of glimmering star-dust-might appear to the characters along the staircase and invite them to seek rest at his palace. There, Nafas imparts the faraway plea he has heard and escorts the characters to the door where it originated. After the adventure, characters can return to the Infinite Staircase through the same door.
In exchange for fulfilling the wish of a creature beyond his reach, Nafas grants the characters a reward of their own. This reward might take the form of one or more of the following:

Magical Gift. Nafas bestows a supernatural charm (see the Dungeon Master's Guide) on the party. Tale. Nafas recites a story or poem that reveals information pertinent to a higher ambition or plane-spanning quest pursued by the characters. Wish. Nafas grants the characters one to three castings of the Wish spell on their behalf. The djinni might require the characters to complete multiple adventures before allotting such a handsome gift.

## CENSER OF DREAMS

Nafas beckons weary travelers along the staircase to the Censer of Dreams, a bastion of respite in the continuous expanse. The Censer of Dreams is Nafas's lair. Regional effects for the palace are detailed in appendix B.

Created by Nafas to shelter visitors from other planes, the Censer of Dreams is a testament to the noble genie's generosity and might. Many who stumble on the Infinite Staircase glimpse the djinni's luxurious residence at some point during their journeys. A nexus held aloft by dozens of branching staircases, the palace envelops its visitors in unimaginable comforts.

The Censer of Dreams is a wonder of aeolian architecture shaped by a being of pure wind. Massive, shutterless windows line the bulbous fortress, allowing the djinni and other flying creatures to flit through its airy halls unimpeded. Hewn from smooth marble and perfumed with floral fragrances, its grand chambers hum with the pleasing tones of magical chimes hung from lofty ceilings. Windcatchers rise from the top of the structure to capture the gusts that buffet the palace and the staircases around it at all hours. Suffused with the djinni's magic, these winds batter would-be invaders, sending them over the staircase's edge.

## Censer of Dreams Features

The Censer of Dreams has the following features:
Unseen Stewards. A staff of one hundred invisible zephyrs tends to the palace and its guests. Each of these stewards functions as if created by the Unseen Servant spell; however, the zephyrs are permanent fixtures that last until destroyed, and they can move anywhere in the palace without dissipating. Only Nafas and creatures he designates can command the zephyrs. A destroyed zephyr re-forms in a random location within the palace after 1d4 days.
Winds. Winds perpetually swirl around the Censer of Dreams and the staircases that lead to it. Creatures on the Infinite Staircase can find the palace by following the direction of the wind.
Wishes. Fleeting voices can be heard throughout the palace, whispering the desires of creatures throughout the multiverse.

## Palace Visitors

Travelers from every world are welcome within the Censer of Dreams. Nafas values all perspectives and rarely refuses entrants, believing that everyone has a story worth telling. However, troublemakers who offend the djinni or threaten the safety of other visitors are ousted from the palace.

Some genies, especially those from the Elemental Plane of Air, pilgrimage to the Censer of Dreams to hear stories from Nafas. Others hope to join his court and one day earn the title of noble genie themselves.

## Noteworthy Sites

Amid an endless sea of steps, the Censer of Dreams embodies the boundless potential of a wish granted. Its opulent chambers boast heavenly gardens visited by Celestials, sprawling courtyards paved with silver bricks, and the secret desires of the multiverse.

## FOYER

Nafas receives visitors in the foyer-a wide, windowed reception hall that looks out on the Infinite Staircase. As one enters the foyer, they're greeted by a roaring ramp of tangible wind that curls up to the rest of the palace. The updraft supports even the heaviest of creatures, which can easily amble up the windy incline to the areas above. Plush pillows, warm fireplaces, and delectable treats number among the amenities available in the hall.

## Den of Chronicles

Tales come alive in the Den of Chronicles, a storyteller's sanctuary. In the carpeted hall, Nafas weaves a never-ending tapestry of tales from the wishes he has heard.
An immense, jeweled censer hangs from the ceiling on a golden chain. Whenever a story begins, sweet-smelling incense wafts from the receptacle and spreads throughout the palace, notifying its visitors that a new chronicle is about to unfold. As the narrator-whether Nafas or another raconteurspeaks, the fumes take the forms of subjects within the story, dancing to each turn of phrase. Meanwhile, animated kettles distribute steaming cups of hot tea to avid listeners seated within the hall.
Nafas delights in hearing the stories of his visitors, especially tales of adventures beyond the Infinite Staircase. Easily moved, the djinni disarms audiences with his booming laugh and profound sobs.

## Guest Quarters

The palace's accommodations are individualized oases sprinkled with genie magic. Illusions within each room tailor its contents to the preferences of its guests, transforming it into a personal utopia. A traveler who hails from a snowy tundra might melt at the sight of a rustic mountain lodge, complete with a crackling hearth, a bearskin rug, and the savory scent of dwarven ale. The next room over might appear as a beachside bungalow, a peaceful elven glade, or a wizard's scriptorium. Every room is someone's paradise.

## Well of Destiny

The voices of the multiverse cry out in the Well of Destiny. A sanctum located within the silvery dome that rises from the center of the palace, the Well of Destiny is a magnet for the words of hopeful souls manifesting their desires to the winds. When he isn't entertaining guests, Nafas can usually be found here, seated on his throne: a weightless, highbacked chair sculpted from the clouds that pervade the misty chamber. The djinni reflects on each wish he hears, contemplating the stories behind them.
Each time a wish is spoken somewhere in the multiverse, it echoes in the Well of Destiny, amplified by the Infinite Staircase's ambient magic. The Well of Destiny Wishes table includes examples of wishes that might be heard within the hall or the staircases beyond, inspiring characters to adventure or giving them a reason to seek out Nafas.

## Well of Destiny Wishes

d6 Wish
1 "I wish I could find my way back home."
2 "I wish to find a cure for this magical sickness."
3 "I wish we could defeat the evil that rules over us."
4 "I wish I could destroy that artifact once and for all."
5 "I wish for revenge on the one who wronged me."
6 "I wish I were free from this cursed prison."

## Staircase Adventures

The adventures in this book take the characters to wondrous realms beyond the Infinite Staircase, but some quests might take place on the staircase itself. The Infinite Staircase Adventures table offers suggestions for stories involving the extradimensional realm.

## Infinite Staircase Adventures

d4 Adventure
1 The Iron Shadow spreads to a character's home world, leaving it a gray, apathetic husk. A survivor asks the characters to repair the damage.
2 For reasons unknown, the masons construct a gloomy staircase to an evil, nightmarish realm. Unsupervised, its doors release horrors that wreak havoc on other worlds. Nafas hires the characters to seal the portals.
3 A powerful efreeti from the City of Brass sets out to conquer numerous worlds through the doors of the Infinite Staircase. Nafas charges the characters with foiling the efreeti's scheme.
4 The staircase's doors lose their magic, preventing passage into or out of the planar realm. A traveler along the staircase beseeches the party to solve the mystery so the traveler can return home.
