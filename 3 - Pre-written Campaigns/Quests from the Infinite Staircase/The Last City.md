# The Last City

OST IN THE DESERT, THE LAST GREAT REMNANT OF a once-prosperous civilization rises from the dunes. Within this ziggurat await untold riches and the sunken city of Cynidicea-along with unexpected challenges, deadly threats, and the fallen kingdom's desperate inhabitants.

Forsaken by the outside world, the Cynidiceans don elaborate masks and vie against each other in factions devoted to ancient gods. Meanwhile, an ageless evil of unknown origin lurks in the bowels of the dilapidated ziggurat. Called Zargon the Returner, the tentacled, one-eyed creature preys on the Cynidiceans even as they worship it as a god. To reclaim their former kingdom, the Cynidiceans must oust the eldritch abomination and its cultists.
"The Lost City" is designed for four to six 1st-level characters. If, on completing the adventure, you wish to extend it further, consult the "Extending the Adventure" section at the end of this chapter.

## BACKGROUND

Centuries ago, Cynidicea was the capital of a prosperous kingdom. Through advancements in magic and technology, the Cynidiceans reclaimed land from the desert and transformed their city into a paradise. Cynidicea peaked with the reign of King Alendria and Queen Zanobis. After the deaths of these last great monarchs, the Cynidiceans honored them by erecting a massive step pyramid that served as an important city hub for years.

The fall of Cynidicea began when workers digging under the ziggurat discovered a gnarled, jet-black horn jutting from a mysterious obelisk. Unknown to the workers, the horn belonged to Zargon, a timeless evil entombed in the obelisk eons ago. The moment the Cynidiceans pried the horn from the monolith, their city was doomed. Materializing from its severed protuberance, Zargon devoured the workers and slew the garrisons that followed, drowning them in torrents of slime.

Rather than face the grim reality confronting them, some Cynidiceans began to view their fellow citizens as sacrifices to a new and voracious god, gradually forming a strange cult to Zargon. Choked by Zargon's slime and assailed by opportunistic invaders, the Cynidiceans fled underground.
![img-5.jpeg](Quests%20from%20the%20Infinite%20Staircase_img-5.jpeg)

Led by the Cult of Zargon, the Cynidiceans began to rebuild, constructing a miserable reflection of their former kingdom in the darkness. Above, drifting sands covered the city, and Cynidicea was lost in the vastness of the desert.

## Using the Infinite Staircase

If you're using Nafas as a patron, he summons the characters to the Censer of Dreams (detailed in chapter 1), where he recounts the following wish:
"I have heard the distressed prayers of a fallen people ensnared by an ageless evil. They whisper the names of long-forgotten gods in a city beneath the desert, hoping to rekindle their kingdom's lost glory. I must know whether they are beyond saving. Return to me with their story."

Nafas then teleports the characters to a door along the Infinite Staircase that opens into a stone arch in a vast desert. The arch isn't far from the ruins of Cynidicea. After the adventure, the characters can return to the staircase through the same portal.

---

## Adventure Hooks

If you're not using Nafas as a group patron, consider the following ways to involve the characters in this adventure:

Anthropological Expedition. A recent desert excavation has unearthed evidence of a bygone civilization. A scholar hires the characters to explore the Cynidicean ruins and report their findings.
Desert Caravan. The characters joined a desert caravan, but a sandstorm separated the party from the rest of the caravan. After wandering the desert for days and running out of food and water, the characters discover an ancient ziggurat.

## Setting the Adventure

Lost to time and sand, Cynidicea is barely a memory to the lands where it once prospered. When deciding where to place Cynidicea, consider the following suggestions:
Dragonlance. On the world of Ansalon, Southern Ergoth and the Northern Wastes both contain arid stretches where Cynidicea might have existed.
Forgotten Realms. The ruins of Cynidicea might lie among the dunes of Anauroch on the continent of Faer√ªn.
Mystara. On the Known World, the kingdom of Cynidicea could have occupied an isolated region of the Alasiyian Desert.

## Adventure Summary

"The Lost City" is a dungeon delve with a dose of intrigue. While in the desert, the characters discover a ruined ziggurat peeking over the dunes. Inside the monument, they encounter three bickering factions of Cynidiceans who seek to reinstate their onceproud kingdom. Characters can align with one or more factions, reaping the rewards of membership at the risk of ostracizing rival groups.

As the characters explore the ziggurat, they slowly uncover clues of the tragedy that befell Cynidicea and its people. While braving clever traps, evil cultists, and restless Undead, the characters might learn that Zargon, the one-eyed creature that caused Cynidicea's fall, still dwells beneath the monument. The party might even discover an entrance to the surviving Cynidiceans' underground city (see the "Extending the Adventure" section at the end of this adventure).
The adventure concludes when the characters escape the ziggurat, either by returning to the desert or finding a door to the Infinite Staircase placed in a location of your choice.

## Character Advancement

If you want to use story-based level advancement, the characters receive experience points for achieving the following milestones rather than defeating monsters:
Encountering a Faction. After the characters first encounter the leader of one of Cynidicea's three factions (detailed in the following section), everyone in the party who survives the encounter gains 1 level. This advancement occurs only once, even if the characters later encounter another faction leader.
Entering the Tomb Complex. When the characters enter the fourth tier of the ziggurat for the first time, the characters gain 1 level.
Escaping the Ziggurat. The characters gain 1 level on completing the adventure, either by escaping the ziggurat or further exploring its depths (see the "Extending the Adventure" section).
If you follow this method, the characters should reach 4 th level by the adventure's conclusion.

## About the Original

Published in 1982, The Lost City was written by Tom Moldvay, who contributed to the Dungeons of Dragons Basic Set. Following in the footsteps of other "B-series" adventures, The Lost City served as both an adventure and a learning tool for new Dungeon Masters. While the adventure detailed the upper levels of the Cynidicean ziggurat, DMs could test their mettle by expanding the dungeon to include its lower levels, for which the module provided only rudimentary features. This updated version of the adventure forgoes this exercise, providing an optional sixth level below the ziggurat.

## The Cynidiceans

Since their kingdom's fall, generations of Cynidiceans have eked out a subterranean existence. Few have ever glimpsed the sun, and some deny the outside world exists at all. Cynidiceans represent a spectrum of genders and species, though most are human.

Cynidiceans embrace lifestyles of twisted decadence to distract themselves from their abject misery. Every citizen wears a stylized mask, usually the face of an animal or other creature that embodies the wearer's personality. Some masks are carved from wood or bone, while others are forged from precious metals. Cynidiceans dress in once-lavish clothing that's now faded and frayed. Elaborate jewelry-fashioned from scavenged beads, feathers, and other baubles-complements their torn robes and haunting visages, transforming each citizen into a walking mockery of their once-respected people.

After years of isolation, some Cynidiceans have abandoned their identities and adopted strange behaviors based on the faces they wear. A Cynidicean who wears a feline mask might meow during conversation or purr when pleased, while one who dons a bee mask might devote themself to making honey, buzzing noisily wherever they go.

## Cult of ZargON

Rising from the fetid slime that drowned their former kingdom, the cultists of Zargon revere the horned abomination as a god. These fanatics gather in a black stone temple in the underground city, where they prepare living sacrifices to Zargon and sow fear among the remaining Cynidiceans. Periodically, the cultists venture up to the tunnels beneath the ziggurat to feed Zargon and kneel to it in worship, clashing with any who would deny their overlord tribute.

Zargonites each wear a horned, golden mask with four tentacles sprouting from its chin, representing the Returner's visage.

## Factions of Cynidicea

Three factions of Cynidiceans seek to restore the worship of the old gods Gorm, Usamigaras, and Madarua. Opposed by the cultists of Zargon, each faction hopes to stop the slow death of their society and regain Cynidicea's past glory. However, cooperation between the groups is rare and frequently devolves into altercations.

## Guardians of Gorm

The Guardians of Gorm are followers of Gorm, a god of justice, storms, and war. Members of this tight-knit fellowship value bravery, honesty, and
![img-7.jpeg](Quests%20from%20the%20Infinite%20Staircase_img-7.jpeg)
justice tempered by mercy. They view storms as holy and believe thunder to be Gorm's reboant voice.
Guardians wear brass masks depicting the stern, bearded face of Gorm and deep blue tunics. Under each guardian's armor, their right shoulder bears a cobalt-hued tattoo of a lightning bolt.

## Mages of Usamigaras

Like their mischievous god Usamigaras-a deity of magic, messengers, and thieves-the Mages of Usamigaras are outwardly kind but duplicitous in nature. They prize trickery above sincerity and never speak their true intentions, advancing their goals through deceit and treachery.
Mages wear silver masks of a smiling, round-faced boy-the face of Usamigaras-along with silvery robes that draw attention away from their hidden wands. Each mage's right palm bears a tattoo of a five-pointed star.

## Warriors of Madarua

The ancient god Madarua presides over birth, death, and the shifting seasons. Courage, adaptability, and wit are paramount to the Warriors of Madarua, and these traits have served them well-within the underground city, this faction is outnumbered only by the Cult of Zargon.
Madarua's warriors wear bronze masks of her expressionless face. They dress in bronze armor and favor spears, and each member bears a sickle-shaped tattoo on their left wrist.

---

## Buried ZigGURAT

Regardless of what brings the characters to the desert, the adventure begins when they happen on a dilapidated ziggurat. This impressive monument honors the last and greatest rulers of Cynidicea. Though the ziggurat is usually buried in the sands, a sandstorm has uncovered its upper tiers.
When the characters arrive at the ziggurat, read or paraphrase the following text:

Your trek through the desert halts at the ruins of a lost civilization. Mountains of sand bury most of the weathered city, but a few stubborn landmarks protrude from the mounds. Arid winds and the passage of time have scoured their faces smooth.
A windswept ziggurat towers over the other ruins. Five stepped tiers are visible, though the lowest barely peeks above the sand. In all, the ancient structure rises over one hundred feet into the sky.
Three thirty-foot-tall statues stand atop the monument: a strong, bearded man holding a pair of scales in one hand and a lightning bolt in the other; a winged child entwined in a pair of snakes; and a stoic woman grasping a sword and a sheaf of wheat.
On the south side of the ziggurat, a ramp with stairs ascends to the monument's highest tier.

The three statues depict Cynidicea's ancient gods: Gorm, Usamigaras, and Madarua. A character who studies the statues and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Religion) check recognizes the lost godswho might still have sparse followers in nearby regions-and their portfolios.
The ziggurat's main entrance is buried beneath the sands and sealed from the inside. Characters who search for another entrance find the once-hidden secret door to area B1 near the top of the ziggurat.

## Ziggurat Features

The ziggurat is made of large blocks of smooth sandstone. Unless otherwise noted, the ziggurat has the following features:
Ceilings. Corridors have 10 -foot-high ceilings, and rooms have 15 -foot-high ceilings.
Doors and Secret Doors. Interior doors are heavy stone slabs that can be pushed open from either side. Secret doors blend in with their surroundings. A character who examines a wall for a secret door must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to notice it. Most doors are unlocked and quietly close on their own unless held or jammed open.

Lighting. The ziggurat's chambers aren't illuminated. Area descriptions assume the characters have a light source or other means of seeing in the dark. Humanoids encountered in the ziggurat have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet, as they've adapted to life underground.

## RANDOM EnCOUNTERS

For each hour the party spends in the ruins, roll a d6. On a roll of 1 , an encounter occurs. To determine what the characters encounter, roll on the Random Ziggurat Encounters table.
Several of the encounters below are with specific Cynidiceans within the ziggurat and aren't likely to happen more than once unless the characters seek them out. If you roll on the table and get the same result as a previous roll, feel free to reroll or choose a different encounter.

## Random Ziggurat Encounters

d12 Encounter
11 rust monster
22 giant centipedes
31 owlbear
4 1d4 hobgoblins search for treasure.
5 A commoner in a Cynidicean wolf mask believes he's a werewolf. When he sees the party, he drops on all fours, howls, and sniffs each character. He's friendly toward the characters but afraid of silver.
6 Three priests in fiendish Cynidicean masks approach the party with censers. Convinced the characters are possessed by demons, the priests assail the characters with chants and foul-smelling smoke before continuing on their way.
7 Two guards in bright yellow robes and Cynidicean masks of scowling warriors kneel before one of the characters, addressing them as King Alendria or Queen Zanobis. They follow the character, singing songs of praise and defending them from peril.
8 A number of commoners equal to the number of characters appear, wearing masks eerily similar to the characters' faces. These Cynidiceans mimic the characters as best they can for 10 minutes, even if it costs the Cynidiceans their lives.
9 1d4 guardians of Gorm (see appendix B) try to escort the characters to their leader in area B12.
10 1d4 mages of Usamigaras (see appendix B) try to escort the characters to their leader in area B18.
11 1d4 warriors of Madarua (see appendix B) try to escort the characters to their leader in area B25.
12 1d6 cultists of Zargon declare that the characters must be sacrificed to the Returner and attempt to capture them alive.

Map 2.1: Buried Ziggurat, Tiers 1-3

---

## Ziggurat Locations, Tiers 1-3

The top three tiers of the ziggurat once served as living and ceremonial spaces for Cynidicean priests. The following locations are keyed to map 2.1.

## B1: StatuE ROOM

When the characters ascend the monument, read or paraphrase the following text:

Near the ziggurat's peak, a once-secret entrance stands open, its stone slab held ajar by the decaying body of a hobgoblin. A crossbow bolt protrudes from the corpse's chest.

The corpse is that of an explorer who reached the ziggurat several weeks ago. After he triggered a deadly crossbow trap in the corridor, his fellow expeditioners stripped him of equipment and proceeded into the monument. A character who examines the area and succeeds on a DC 13 Intelligence (Investigation) check spots a tripped pressure plate on the floor and an empty crossbow in the wall.
When the characters enter the chamber, read or paraphrase the following text:

The highest tier of the step pyramid holds a musty forty-foot-square chamber. Dust and sand coat its floor. Three bronze cylinders, each inset with a small door, span floor to ceiling in the middle of the room.

Footprints of several humanoids are visible in the dust, stopping in front of the center cylinder.
Shortly after all characters enter the chamber, the corpse (or anything propping the door open) crumbles and the door automatically shuts, sealing characters in the lightless chamber. Once closed, the door can be pushed open only from outside. It can't be opened from inside, and it has no lock to pick. The characters must find a new way out of the ziggurat.
Gas Trap. When the door closes, the area begins to fill with an odorless, dizzying gas. Characters who have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 13 or higher hear a steady hiss as the gas seeps through tiny holes in the wall. The gas immediately fills the room and dissipates after 1 minute. While the room is filled with gas, each creature that ends its turn in the room takes 1 poison damage. Creatures reduced to 0 hit points by the gas have the unconscious condition but are stable rather than dying.
If all characters succumb to the gas, 1d4 guardians of Gorm (see appendix B) eventually discover them and deliver them to the faction's leader in area B12.

Cylinders. The three cylinders in this area are the hollow bases of the statues atop the ziggurat: Gorm to the west, Madarua to the east, and Usamigaras in the center.
Three crossbow traps are hidden in the south wall, one aimed at each cylinder. A character who searches the area for traps and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check spots the crossbows. A character has advantage on this check if they spotted the crossbow that killed the hobgoblin. Removing the bolts disarms the traps; the central crossbow is already empty.
When a creature opens the door on the east or west cylinder, a crossbow trap shoots a bolt at that creature. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 3 (1d6) piercing damage. The center cylinder's trap has already been triggered, and a character who examines the floor notices dried blood flecking the dust there.
The base of each statue contains a ladder down to the storeroom (area B2) and up into the statue above, which is also hollow. Each statue contains a speaking tube, as well as a series of rusty levers that can be used to reposition the statue's head and limbs.

## B2: Machinery Storeroom

Three ladders descend from the cylinders into this storeroom. The feet of the ladders are lit by three skittering giant beetles with glowing glands beneath their carapaces. Against the south wall is a small forge and a workbench scattered with aged machinery.

Three giant fire beetles skitter about this storeroom, hunting for food. If the beetles detect the characters, the beetles hiss and attack.
Treasure. This room contains spare parts for the machinery and traps in area B1. Strewn throughout the room are twenty crossbow bolts, six flasks of oil, and a set of smith's tools near a small foundry.

## B3: SECRET ROOM

This room can be accessed via two secret doors in the hallways bordering it. When the characters enter, read or paraphrase the following text:

A shriveled humanoid corpse in blue robes and a brass mask lies in the center of this stale-smelling room. The corpse's stiff, wrinkled hand stretches toward a toppled leather pouch just out of reach. Glittering, blue gemstones have spilled from the bag onto the dusty floor.

---

A dishonest member of the Guardians of Gorm stole riches from the faction's treasure room (area B5) and hid them in this chamber. Before the guardian's last visit, a pack of stirges made the room their lair; when he returned, they drank him dry. A character who inspects the body and succeeds on a DC 13 Wisdom (Medicine) check learns the corpse is fresh but bereft of blood.
Sleeping Stirges. Four stirges, their bellies engorged with the corpse's blood, hang asleep from the ceiling. Bright light or any noise louder than a whisper wakes the stirges, causing them to attack. A character attempting to retrieve the gems must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity (Stealth) check to avoid waking the stirges.
Treasure. Three blue quartz gems worth 25 gp each are scattered across the floor. The leather pouch contains another five gems of the same value. The dead Cynidicean's mask, which depicts the bearded face of Gorm, is made of brass and worth 10 gp .

## B4: Abandoned Priest's Quarters

This room is sparsely furnished with decrepit furniture caked in dust: a soiled bed, a chest, and a writing desk with a wooden chair. A dead hobgoblin is sprawled on the floor, her left arm swollen and discolored.
![img-9.jpeg](Quests%20from%20the%20Infinite%20Staircase_img-9.jpeg)

This room was once the quarters of a priest of Gorm. On the desk lies a wooden holy symbol shaped like a lightning bolt. The hobgoblin is an explorer who died weeks ago after the bees in area B5 swarmed her. A character who examines the body and succeeds on a DC 13 Wisdom (Medicine) check determines the hobgoblin was stung by hundreds of insects.

Treasure. The hobgoblin carries a purse with 8 gp and 27 sp . The chest contains only rotting holy tomes that crumble when opened.

## B5: Treasure Room of Gorm

In the center of this room stands a ten-foot-tall cage. Within the cage, a pile of coins and gems sparkles beneath a gigantic, droning beehive.

The locked cage holds what little treasure the Guardians of Gorm have accumulated. As an action, a character can pick the lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check using thieves' tools. The key is held by Kanadius, the faction's leader (see area B12).

Two swarms of bees nest within the hive; use the swarm of insects (wasps) stat block to represent each of them. The bees are friendly toward the Guardians of Gorm but hostile to all others. If a character comes within 5 feet of the cage or disturbs its contents without first donning a mask of Gorm, the swarms erupt from the hive and attack.

Harvesting Honey. A character who inspects the hive and succeeds on a DC 11 Intelligence (Nature) check knows these bees create a special honey with healing properties. Once the swarms are dealt with, characters can safely harvest 1d4 doses of healing honey from the hive. A creature that consumes one dose of this honey as an action regains $1 \mathrm{~d} 4+1$ hit points.

Treasure. The treasure in the cage includes 400 $\mathrm{sp}, 100 \mathrm{gp}$, two malachite gemstones worth 25 gp each, and a bejeweled necklace worth 150 gp .

## B6: Storage Room

This stuffy room contains only bales of moth-eaten cloth and crates of long-spoiled food.

The door to this storage room has remained closed for decades. The room contains nothing of value.

---

## B7: Fireworks Storeroom

This bone-dry storeroom reeks of sulfur. Six crates are stacked on a frayed rug in the center of the room. Atop the crates, two tiny creatures chat merrily, each barely a foot tall with delicate wings and sparkling hair. A third creature dives through an open crate, occasionally surfacing to spit out a mouthful of sawdust.

Three pixies-Wenly, Weenly, and Wally-are investigating the crates in this storeroom. The pixies speak Common and Sylvan. If approached, the friendly pixies introduce themselves and flit about the characters. The pixies inquire eagerly about the characters' outfits, equipment, and travels, but nothing holds the pixies' attention for long.
The pixies entered the ziggurat two days ago through a crack in the stonework. They don't know the history of Cynidicea or its fall, but they've glimpsed a few of the monument's residents and their customs from a safe distance. The pixies won't join the characters in exploring the ziggurat, but they can share the following information:
Dungeon Dangers. The ziggurat holds many dangers. The deeper you go, the worse it gets.
Masked Factions. Everyone in the ziggurat wears a mask. If two people wear the same mask, they're part of the same faction. The factions don't seem to get along.
The pixies attempt to flee if attacked, defending themselves as necessary. They blow raspberries at the characters as they fly away.
Fireworks. Each sawdust-packed crate contains ten fireworks-stiff paper tubes filled with a gray powder. The fireworks have been neglected for centuries. Roll a d6 for each of the six crates. On a 6, the crate's contents are intact. Otherwise, the fireworks are clearly ruined.
If lit, an intact firework explodes in a harmless burst of light accompanied by a crackling noise audible up to 300 feet away. The light is as bright as a torch flame but lasts only a second.
Pottery Jars. Near the door stand three 4 -foot-tall clay jars once used to put out fires in this room. The first contains sand. The others, which previously stored water, are empty.

## B8: Abandoned Room

A greenish, viscous slime covers the floor and walls of this bare room. In the middle lies a single decomposing corpse in blue robes and a brass mask.

The walls and floors of this room are covered in patches of hazardous green slime (see the Dungeon Master's Guide). A dwarf member of the Guardians of Gorm perished here weeks ago. The slime has been slowly digesting the body since.
Treasure. The dead guardian wears a brass mask of Gorm worth 10 gp . The mask is out of reach of the green slime.

## B9: Abandoned Priest's Quarters

This neglected room contains a ragged bed, an oaken chest, and a writing table and chair. Puffs of dust and unsettling crunching noises emanate from atop the bed, where a lizard the size of a horse feeds on a humanoid corpse.

On the bed, a giant lizard munches on the body of an unfortunate Cynidicean. If the lizard notices the characters, it abandons its meal in favor of fresh meat. While feasting on the corpse, the lizard tangled its tail in the dead Cynidicean's mask; during combat, the mask remains wrapped around the lizard's tail.
A second giant lizard with pale blue scales and orange spots clings to the ceiling, waiting to ambush unsuspecting entrants. Characters who have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 13 or higher notice the lizard before it attacks.
Treasure. The Cynidicean's mask, depicting a hawk with a golden beak, is worth 20 gp . The chest contains a rusty dagger and a set of torn vestments.

## B10: Abandoned Priest's Quarters

This room is identical in arrangement to area B9, but it's unoccupied and contains no corpses. A wooden holy symbol in the shape of a balance rests on the desk.
Treasure. The chest in this room contains a priest's pack. The rations inside spoiled long ago.

## B11: Barracks of Gorm

Three bunk beds line the walls of these ramshackle barracks. Four brawny humanoids sit on the lower bunks, listening intently to a fifth who ominously gestures from beneath a tattered white sheet, as if mimicking a ghost. Each figure wears a blue tunic draped with chain mail, along with a brass mask depicting the same long-haired, bearded man with a stern gaze.

Five guardians of Gorm (see appendix B) recently repurposed this chamber to house their ranks. The sheet-draped guardian, a dwarf named Artha,

---

is recounting an experience she had on the fourth level of the ziggurat. She claims to have seen the ghost of King Alendria there.
When the guardians notice the characters, Artha stops her story and asks the party to identify themselves and whom they serve. If the characters speak favorably of Gorm or declare no allegiances, Artha warmly invites them to join the Guardians of Gorm, then escorts the party to area B12 to meet the faction's leader, Kanadius. If the characters insult Gorm or claim to worship Madarua or Usamigaras, Artha tells the characters to turn back or suffer Gorm's thunderous wrath.
If the characters attack the guardians or refuse to heed their warnings, the guardians produce weapons and defend their turf. Combat in this room draws the attention of the guardians in area B12, who send two guardians of Gorm from that room to investigate. The guardians aim to knock the characters out rather than kill them, leaving their judgment to Kanadius.
Treasure. Three maces rest against a weapons rack on the west wall. This room also contains enough food and water to sustain ten Humanoids for five days. The five guardians each wear a brass mask of Gorm worth 10 gp .

## B12: Grand Master of Gorm

A gold-plated statue of Gorm-a smaller version of the statue atop the ziggurat-stands in the hallway east of this room. The gold flakes easily, revealing the statue's wooden construction beneath.
Characters who listen at the door hear drums thrumming within. When the characters enter, read or paraphrase the following text:

Like claps of thunder, drums boom in this aged barracks. With each rumble, dust and sand trickle from the ceiling onto the drummers. These five humanoids each wear a blue tunic and a brass mask of the same long-haired, bearded man with a stern gaze.
Amid the drummers sits an older human man on a wooden throne. He wears distinguished, midnight-hued robes, and his long, winter-white hair peeks from beneath his mask and fanciful helm.

Five guardians of Gorm (see appendix B) conduct a storm ceremony under the supervision of Kanadius (lawful good, human champion of Gorm; see appendix B), the Grand Master of Gorm. Kanadiuswho wears a Helm of Telepathy-is stoic but kind, with a grandfatherly demeanor. He leads by example and has earned the respect of his fellow guardians.

---

Meeting Kanadius. Kanadius and the other guardians are initially indifferent toward the party. When he's aware of the characters, Kanadius raises a wrinkled hand to quiet the drummers. If the characters don't act with hostility, Kanadius asks who they are and why they are here, using the magic of his helm to probe their answers for sincerity. Surmising the characters are outsiders, Kanadius offers to tell them about the once-proud kingdom of Cynidicea and its fall. He then might ask one or more characters to join his faction, depending on whether they answered him truthfully (see the "Joining the Guardians" section).
If the characters attack the Guardians of Gorm, Kanadius curses the characters, denouncing them as spies of Usamigaras. The guardians defend their leader with fervor, covering Kanadius's retreat as he attempts to flee through a trapdoor under his throne to the Ceremonial Chamber of Gorm (area B26), where he might be encountered later.
What Kanadius Knows. In addition to the history and fall of Cynidicea (detailed at the beginning of this adventure), Kanadius can impart the following information:

Cynidicean Factions. There are three other groups in the ziggurat: the Mages of Usamigaras, the Warriors of Madarua, and the Cult of Zargon. Kanadius doesn't trust any of them, but the Zargonites are especially ruthless.
Dungeon Tip. The lower levels of the ziggurat are haunted by Undead.
Glory of Cynidicea. Kanadius believes only the Guardians of Gorm can restore Cynidicea's lost glory.
Joining the Guardians. If a character was honest with Kanadius, he asks them to join the Guardians of Gorm. Kanadius rewards the first three characters who accept with a Potion of Healing. He then leads them to the Ceremonial Chamber of Gorm (area B26) for a brief induction ceremony, where each inductee is given a storm-blue tunic, a brass mask of Gorm worth 10 gp , and a blue tattoo of a lightning bolt on their right shoulder. Kanadius also tells inductees the password to avoid the trapped door to area B26: "by the great god Gorm."

The Guardians of Gorm and their allies can rest safely here and in areas B11 and B26 without triggering random encounters.
Rejecting the Guardians. If the characters reject Kanadius's offer, he nods solemnly and politely asks them to go back the way they came. The faction doesn't allow nonmembers to enter their treasure room or ceremonial chamber. Kanadius holds no grudges if the characters later change their minds.

Trapdoor. A secret trapdoor lies under Kanadius's throne. A character who inspects the throne and succeeds on a DC 13 Intelligence (Investigation) check notices marks around the chair and discovers a ladder beneath the trapdoor, which leads down to the secret door in area B26.
Treasure. Kanadius wears a Helm of Telepathy. He and the other five guardians each wear a brass mask of Gorm worth 10 gp . Stashed in a chest under one of the beds are six more masks, six blue tunics, and three Potions of Healing.

## B13: Revolving Passage

This central area connects eight hallways on the third tier of the ziggurat via a revolving passage on a stone turntable.
On the wall inside the revolving passage is a row of four levers, each corresponding to one of the passage's possible orientations: running north to south, east to west, northwest to southeast, or northeast to southwest. When a lever is pulled, if the passage isn't already aligned with the corresponding orientation, the passage grinds faintly and swings clockwise to match the lever. This process takes 1 round. Only one lever can be engaged at once, and pulling a lever disengages any previously engaged lever.
Adjoining Corridors. Each of the eight hallways adjacent to the revolving passage sports a similar lever embedded in the wall. Pulling one of these levers rotates the passage to meet that hallway as if the corresponding lever had been pulled inside area B13. When the passage isn't aligned with a hallway, it appears as a curved wall from the outside.

## B14: Abandoned Ceremonial Chamber

Rubble litters the floor of this vandalized and ruined temple. The altar is cracked in half, and the chamber's once-brilliant banners, now tattered and stained, sag from its walls. Scrawled on the wall is the image of a tentacled eye with a long, black horn and one word in Common: "Zargon."

The cultists of Zargon ravaged this room years ago. Except for the wreckage, the room is empty.
Hidden Ramp. On the south side of the chamber, a hinged, 20 -foot-long section of the floor gently swings down to area B27 when a Small or larger creature steps on it. The character with the highest passive Wisdom (Perception) score notices the ramp without stepping on it.

---

Clusters of pale-yellow fungus blanket the shelves of this storeroom. The air is thick with spores.

The stores in this room are covered in four patches of yellow mold (see the Dungeon Master's Guide).
Most of the food here is unfit for consumption, but a crate marked with a bee along the east wall contains 1d4 doses of healing honey, crystallized but still edible. A creature that consumes one dose of this honey as an action regains $1 \mathrm{~d} 4+1$ hit points. This honey was produced by bees like those in area B5. Characters can open the crate without disturbing the yellow mold.
Secret Door. A secret door in the south wall leads to area B16.

## B16: SECRET ROOM

This room is hidden behind a secret door in the hallway bordering it and another in the next room. A large wicker basket, filled with coins and gems, rests on the floor. Two horned vipers (poisonous snakes) hide in the basket, ready to strike.
Treasure. The basket contains 300 sp and five jasper stones worth 50 gp each.

## B17: Abandoned Ceremonial Chamber

Tattered tapestries hang from the walls of this ruined chapel. Along the north wall lies an altar draped with a ratty cloth. Atop it rest three wooden candlesticks, an offering bowl, and a holy symbol shaped like an eye. A mangled human corpse slumps against the altar.

The corpse is a thief who sought to plunder the ziggurat but fell to one of its many wandering threats. Unlike the Cynidiceans, the plunderer wears no mask.
Treasure. The corpse carries a full canteen of water, three days of rations, and a sack with 40 gp and two citrines worth 50 gp each. The holy sym-bol-which honors the elder evil Zargon-houses a smooth sphere of yellow jasper worth 25 gp .

## B18: CHAMBER OF Usamigaras

The corridors outside this room are painted black with tiny stars resembling the night sky. The room's iron doors each bear an engraved star. An audible Alarm spell warns the room's inhabitants when a creature other than a mage of Usamigaras touches either door.
![img-10.jpeg](Quests%20from%20the%20Infinite%20Staircase_img-10.jpeg)

When the characters enter, read or paraphrase:

Along the north and west walls of this spacious ceremonial hall hangs a tapestry of the night sky, its fabric embroidered with silvery constellations. In front of a star-shaped stone altar, five figures gather, each wearing starry robes and a silver mask depicting the face of a smiling child. The centermost figure wears a jewel-studded silver crown.

Four mages of Usamigaras (see appendix B) have just initiated a new member in their faction's ceremonial chamber. The ritual was supervised by Auriga Sirkinos (chaotic neutral, elf champion of Usamigaras; see appendix B), Chief Mage of Usamigaras. Superficially amicable and jolly, their pleasant exterior conceals a treacherous fanatic who would do anything to promote their faction. Auriga and the other mages are initially indifferent toward the party.
Meeting Auriga. Auriga welcomes the characters warmly, asking if the party has come to join the Mages of Usamigaras. To further tantalize the characters, the chief mage coyly remarks that the benefits of membership are many, but the Grinning God's expectations of his devotees are high. Characters who wish to join the faction must prove their worth (see the "Joining the Mages" section).

---

![img-11.jpeg](Quests%20from%20the%20Infinite%20Staircase_img-11.jpeg)

If the characters attack, the mages defend themselves and their leader. Auriga attempts to flee to the lower levels of the ziggurat and might be encountered there later.
What Auriga Knows. In addition to the history and fall of Cynidicea (detailed at the beginning of this adventure), Auriga can impart the following information:

Cynidicean Factions. Three other groups vie for power in the ziggurat: the Guardians of Gorm, the Warriors of Madarua, and the Cult of Zargon. The monster the Zargonites serve dwells deep beneath the ziggurat and is rumored to be unkillable.
Demetrius. Years ago, the cultists of Zargon killed the former leader of the Mages of Usamigaras, a respected priest named Demetrius.
Dungeon Tip. The ziggurat has many secret doors, which blend in with their surroundings.
Joining the Mages. To be considered for membership, a character must reveal a secret about themself-whether false or true-and make a DC 14 Charisma (Deception or Persuasion) check. Characters who openly display allegiance to another faction in the ziggurat, such as by wearing a mask of Gorm, have disadvantage on this check. Characters who prove they've defeated members of another faction have advantage on this check. On a successful
check, Auriga inducts that character into the Mages of Usamigaras. If a character tries to dupe the mages and fails, Auriga remarks that the character is a poor liar.
The mages give each inductee a set of starry robes, a silvered dagger, a silver mask worth 25 gp , and a silver tattoo of a five-pointed star on their right palm. Auriga also tells inductees how to operate the shifting wall in area B21. Additionally, if at least one character joins the faction, Auriga gifts the party a Wand of Secrets from a hidden niche in the altar.
The Mages of Usamigaras and their allies can rest safely here and in area B19 without triggering random encounters.
Rejecting the Mages. If no characters join the Mages of Usamigaras, Auriga allows the party to leave unharmed. For the next three days, characters have disadvantage on Charisma checks made to influence members of the faction.
Treasure. Auriga and their four mages each wear a silver mask of Usamigaras worth 25 gp . Auriga wears a bejeweled silver crown worth 100 gp and carries a Wand of Magic Detection.
A character who inspects the altar and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check finds a hidden compartment. Inside are six more masks, six sets of robes, six silvered daggers, and a Wand of Secrets.

---

Six bunk beds dot this well-kept chamber. Two wooden chests rest at the foot of each bed.

This remarkably clean room belongs to the Mages of Usamigaras. The mages in area B18 sleep here when away from their stronghold in the underground city (see the "Extending the Adventure" section). The chests contain spare robes and various personal belongings but nothing of value.
Secret Door. A secret door in the south wall leads to Auriga's quarters (area B20).

## B20: Chief Mage's Quarters

This comfortable bedroom shows signs of recent occupation. At the foot of the bed sits an iron chestand next to it, a gray-furred wolf lies curled on the floor. The wolf wakes and growls as the door opens.

A dire wolf, captured as a cub and trained as a guard dog, protects Auriga's private chambers. The wolf is hostile toward anyone other than Auriga who enters this room, but a character who makes calming gestures or offers it food can placate it with a successful DC 16 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. Characters dressed in the attire of the Mages of Usamigaras have advantage on this check. If a character pacifies the wolf, it retrieves a slobbery humanoid bone from under Auriga's bed and whines until a character plays fetch with it.
Trapped Chest. The chest is locked, and Auriga carries its key. As an action, a character can pick the lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check using thieves' tools.
The chest is also trapped. A character who examines the chest and succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence (Investigation) check discovers the trap, which can be disabled as an action with a successful DC 14 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check using thieves' tools. A creature that opens the chest without using the proper key or disabling the trap causes a poison needle to spring from the lock. The creature that triggered the poison needle takes 1 piercing damage plus 11 (2d10) poison damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the poisoned condition for 1 hour.
Treasure. The trapped chest holds $40 \mathrm{gp}, 500$ sp, and a vial with two doses of carrion crawler mucus (a type of poison described in the Dungeon Master's Guide).

## B21: Shifting Wall

At the western end of this short corridor stands an eight-foot-tall silver statue of an impish, winged child with two snakes twined around his body. The smiling, round-faced boy holds a wand in one hand and a handful of coins in the other. The statue is firmly connected to the wall.

The silver-plated statue at the end of the hall depicts the god Usamigaras and hides a shifting wall. Tapping on the statue reveals its hollow construction.
A character who inspects the statue and succeeds on a DC 13 Intelligence (Investigation) check learns that the statue's wand controls a mechanism in the wall. A character who succeeds on this check by 5 or more also knows the correct direction to pull the wand to cause the wall to shift. Members of the Mages of Usamigaras, including newly initiated characters, know how to control the shifting wall.
If the wand is pulled to the left, the wall and statue rotate ninety degrees, allowing passage into the corridor beyond for 1 minute, then shift back into place.
If the wand is pulled to the right, the statue exhales poison gas in a 15 -foot-cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 5 (1d10) poison damage.

## B22: STOREROOM

Dusty crates and barrels fill this storeroom. Four small, winged creatures, surrounded by clouds of sand, crowd a cask with wine trickling from its spout.

Four dust mephits rummage through the stores in this room. They've just discovered a cask of wine. The dust mephits are hostile toward characters who disrupt their festivities but friendly toward any who join in the revelry.
Secret Door. The south wall of this room contains a secret door.

## B23: Ceremonial Chamber of Madarua

In the hallway outside this shrine, two 10 -foot-tall bronze statues of female warriors stand with spears crossed to form an arch. Beneath them lies a hidden pressure plate that, when stepped on, rings a chime in area B25 to alert the Warriors of Madarua of creatures approaching their shrine. A character who examines the arch and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check notices the pressure plate.
The door to the chamber is locked. As an action, a character can pick the lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check using thieves'

---

tools or force open the door with a successful DC 18 Strength (Athletics) check.
When the characters enter the chamber, read or paraphrase the following text:

The fragrance of burning incense pervades this ceremonial chamber. Clean white fabric adorns its walls. Near the northeast corner, two candles illuminate a cloth-draped altar. On the altar stands a statuette of a woman holding a sword and a sheaf of wheat.

Tiny listening holes dot the south wall, concealed by hanging cloths. If the characters forced open the door, the warriors in area B25 investigate, and the encounter in that area happens here instead.
Secret Door. A cloth on the south wall hides a secret door to area B24.
Treasure. The statuette depicts the god Madarua. It is made of bronze and worth 10 gp .

## B24: Treasure Room of Madarua

The stone walls of this narrow chamber are bare. Set into the east wall, a stone vault has a single keyhole on its heavy, round door.

This room's vault contains the treasure of the Warriors of Madarua. The faction's leader, Pandora (see area B25), carries the key. As an action, a character can pick the vault's lock with a successful DC 16 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check using thieves' tools. A character who fails this check, or who tries to force the vault open, triggers the ceiling trap.
Ceiling Trap. A character who inspects the vault and succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence (Investigation) check determines the stone ceiling above the vault is rigged to crumble if the vault is forced open. When the trap triggers, a 10 -foot-wide section of unstable stone along the ceiling collapses in front of the vault door. Creatures in the area marked on the map must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 11 (2d10) bludgeoning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.
Once the trap is triggered, the floor of that area is filled with rubble and becomes difficult terrain. Triggering the trap attracts the attention of the warriors in area B25, who investigate the disturbance.
Secret Doors. The north and south walls of this room hold the secret doors leading from areas B23 and B25. The outlines of both doors are visible here.
Treasure. The vault contains 300 gp , ten tiger's eye gems worth 25 gp each, six bronze spears worth 10 gp each, six bronze masks of Madarua worth 15 gp each, and a Weapon of Warning (spear).
![img-12.jpeg](Quests%20from%20the%20Infinite%20Staircase_img-12.jpeg)

## B25: Gymnasium of Madarua

Six warriors spar with spears in this stone gymnasium. Each warrior is clad in leather armor over a green tunic and wears a bronze mask of a determined female face. A tall human woman in lightweight armor decorated with bronze supervises them, interjecting to critique their footing.

Six warriors of Madarua (see appendix B) train in this area. The woman supervising them is Pandora (lawful neutral, human champion of Madarua; see appendix B), Madarua's Champion. The oldest and most experienced warrior in the faction, Pandora believes any problem can be solved with swift, direct action. She and the other warriors are initially indifferent to the party.
Meeting Pandora. When Pandora notices the characters, she and her warriors assume a defensive formation. Pandora warns that the characters have entered one of Madarua's sacred chambers and asks whether the characters are friend or foe.
If the characters don't attack, she explains that the Warriors of Madarua are yet another group vying to reclaim Cynidicea. After suffering a handful of losses to the cultists of Zargon on the lower levels, Pandora is on the lookout for new recruits-especially fearless warriors who share her god's interests. She might ask one or more characters to join her faction (see the "Joining the Warriors" section).

---

![img-13.jpeg](Quests%20from%20the%20Infinite%20Staircase_img-13.jpeg)

If the characters attack, the warriors defend themselves fiercely and fight to the death. If slain, Pandora uses her last breath to declare her vanquisher Madarua's new champion.
What Pandora Knows. In addition to the history and fall of Cynidicea (detailed at the beginning of this adventure), Pandora can impart the following:
Cynidicean Factions. There are three other groups in the ziggurat: the Guardians of Gorm, the Mages of Usamigaras, and the Cult of Zargon. The Zargonites kidnap Cynidiceans and sacrifice them to the one-eyed monster they worship.
Dungeon Tip. The tombs on the levels below are riddled with traps.
Glory of Cynidicea. Pandora believes that only the Warriors of Madarua can restore Cynidicea's lost glory.
Joining the Warriors. Pandora admires disciplined warriors who can hold their own. If a character expresses interest in joining the Warriors of Madarua-and if they don't display allegiance to another faction, such as a prominent tattoo or maskPandora challenges them to a wrestling match for membership. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check impresses Pandora during their bout, earning them a faction invite.

New faction members are inducted in the ceremonial chamber of Madarua (area B23). The warriors give each inductee a green tunic, a spear, a bronze mask of Madarua worth 15 gp , and a small sickle-shaped brand on their left wrist. Additionally, if at least one character joins the Warriors of Madarua, Pandora gifts the party the Weapon of Warning (spear) from the faction's treasure room (area B24).
The Warriors of Madarua and their allies can rest safely in this area and in area B23 without triggering random encounters.
Rejecting the Warriors. If no characters join the Warriors of Madarua, Pandora respects their decision but offers them no charity. Two warriors escort the characters to the revolving passage (area B13). If the characters refuse to leave or later return, the warriors regard them with hostility.
Secret Door. The north wall hides a secret door to area B24.
Treasure. Pandora carries a ceremonial +1 Longsword and the key to the treasure vault in area B24. She and the other six warriors each wear a bronze mask of Madarua worth 15 gp .

---

## B26: Ceremonial Chamber of Gorm

The door to this ceremonial chamber is engraved with three lightning bolts limned in blue light. The door is locked and magically trapped. As an action, a character can pick the lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check using thieves' tools. A Detect Magic spell reveals an aura of evocation magic around the door. If a creature outside the chamber picks the lock or touches the trapped door without first speaking the words "by the great god Gorm," the creature takes 4 (1d8) lightning damage.
When the characters enter, read or paraphrase:

The walls, ceiling, and floor of this spacious chamber have been painted sky blue. Flickering candles surround a marble altar near the east wall. Atop the altar rest a golden bowl and a stone statuette of a bearded human man hurling a lightning bolt.

The Guardians of Gorm conduct religious ceremonies in this dimly lit chamber. Characters who join the faction are inducted here.
If the characters attacked Kanadius earlier in the adventure and he escaped (see area B12), he's here along with two guardians of Gorm (see appendix B). Otherwise, the room is unoccupied,

Secret Door. The secret door in the west wall conceals a ladder up to the trapdoor in area B12.

Treasure. The gold altar bowl is worth 50 gp . A character who inspects the altar and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check finds a secret compartment containing a Javelin of Lightning.

## Ziggurat Locations, Tier 4

The fourth tier of the ziggurat holds the tombs of King Alendria, Queen Zanobis, and various members of their court. The following locations are keyed to map 2.2.

## B27: Jester's Burial Room

The walls of this burial chamber sport colorful murals of a human court jester entertaining her king and queen. A niche on the east wall holds a humble coffin.

If a creature touches the coffin, the lid flips open, and a cheery wooden jester on a spring pops up and does a little jig. The prop then hangs lifelessly until the trick is reset by shoving the prop back into the coffin, which also contains the jester's ashes.
Ramp. A portion of the ceiling can swing down on a hinge, forming a ramp leading from area B14 to this chamber. A small handle bolted to the ceiling of this room allows the ramp to be easily raised and lowered by a creature that can reach it.

## B28: High Priest's Burial Room

Scorch marks from a former trap cover the door to this room and the wall around it. This magical trap was recently triggered by a ghoul, whose outline is visible among the scorch marks. The door is ajar and safe to open.
When the characters enter, read or paraphrase:
The walls of this burial room display images of a priest performing ceremonies. On a raised dais in the middle of the room lies an open bronze coffin. Three gangly, ghoulish creatures hunch over the coffin, ripping into the corpse inside and feasting on aged flesh.

Three ghouls are devouring the corpse of a former high priest. When they detect the characters, the ghouls attack, eager to taste ripe flesh.

Treasure. The coffin holds a jeweled necklace worth 300 gp , two jeweled bracelets worth 100 gp each, and two flasks of holy water.

## B29: Ghostly Haunt

As you proceed down this corridor, the ghost of a human man in a shimmering crown and regal attire appears before you. The phantom raises his hand and gestures for you to stop.
"Go no farther," he warns, "lest this cursed monument overtake you. Only death awaits you in these halls."

The figure is the spirit of Alendria (lawful good ghost), the last king of Cynidicea. Cursed to wander his once-splendid tomb, the ghost lingers here to warn honorable travelers of its dangers.
If the characters don't attack, the ghost reveals the following information, then fades away:
Escaping the Ziggurat. The main entrance to-and exit from-the ziggurat (area B57) lies on the next tier down. Its doors have been closed for centuries and can be opened only from the inside.
Haunted Tombs. Horrible creatures haunt the burial chambers of the king and queen. One of the creatures claims to be Queen Zanobis herself. The monarchs can't rest until these wicked Undead are slain.
Undying Enemy. Only fools challenge Zargon and his cultists. All who oppose them fail.
If the characters attack Alendria's ghost, the spirit admonishes them and disappears without delivering the hints above.
Secret Door. The southwest corner hides an entrance to the tomb annex (area B41).

MAR 2.2: BURIED ZIGGURAT, TIER 4

---

## B30: Guard Captain's Burial Room

A cobwebbed human skeleton in decorative pauldrons stands at attention against the west wall of this burial chamber. Four skeletal guards with rusty swords surround the distinguished skeleton.

This burial chamber belongs to King Alendria's honor guard, who defend his kingdom even in death. If the characters enter before defeating the banshee in area B44, the five skeletons animate and attack. The skeletons don't pursue characters outside this room.
If the characters defeat the banshee, the skeletons instead kneel, each pledging a silent vow to defend the characters for the next 1 d 4 hours or until the skeletons earn their second death (whichever comes sooner). After these vows are fulfilled, the skeletons crumble to dust.

## B31: Noble's Burial Room

Scenes of warfare decorate the walls of this burial room. A closed wooden coffin stands upright near the south wall. The image of a noble warrior adorns its lid.

A mummy rests in the coffin, clutching a +1 Rapier to its wrinkled chest. If disturbed, the mummy awakens, releases the rapier, and attacks.

## B32: Ankheg Den

Three empty coffins sit askew in this chamber, their lids chewed through and tossed aside. Near them lie the bubbling remains of a giant rat. Piled in the southwest corner of the room is a mound of rubble.

This burial room has become the den of an ankheg, drawn to the tomb complex to feast on giant rodents and Cynidiceans who come to pay their respects. A character who examines the dead rat and succeeds on a DC 13 Intelligence (Investigation) check determines the rat was killed by acid.
Characters who have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14 or higher feel intensifying tremors beneath them. If a character approaches the mound or remains in this room for longer than 1 minute, the ankheg erupts from the floor and attacks, eager for its next meal.
Treasure. The mound obscures a narrow deadend tunnel in the west wall, just big enough for a Small creature to squeeze through. Here, a giant rat has stored its treasures: a corroded dagger, a purse containing 55 gp , and an unhatched ankheg egg.

## B33: Astrologer's Burial Room

A coffin adorned with glass stars rests atop a square dais in this burial chamber. Magical flames dance above two brass jars, one at each end of the coffin, illuminating scenes on the ceiling of an astrologer creating maps of both the sky and this realm.

This burial chamber is brightly lit by two Continual Flame spells cast on brass jars at the coffin's head and foot. Inside the coffin lies the astrologer's body.
Treasure. A bronze tube in one of the brass jars contains a crudely drawn map of this tier of the ziggurat. Two stars on the map denote the locations of the trapdoor to the fifth tier (see area B40) and the ramp to the third tier (see area B27).

## B34: Master Thief's Burial Room

An elaborate jeweled coffin rests in the center of this otherwise bare room.

A carrion crawler clings to the ceiling in this room, waiting to ambush entrants. Characters who have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 13 or higher notice the carrion crawler before it attacks.
A master thief stole a prime burial place near the king and queen, arranging for her locked coffin to be placed in this unmarked chamber. As an action, a character can pick the lock with a successful DC 20 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check using thieves' tools. Inside rests the decrepit, still-smirking corpse of a halfling.
Treasure. Ten jewels set in the coffin are worth 50 gp each. Inside the coffin is a gold-plated set of thieves' tools worth 10 gp and two silvered daggers.

## B35: Chamberlain's Burial Room

The door to this room is boarded up with dusty planks. When the characters enter, read:

This burial room reeks of death. Beneath murals depicting a human man signing documents and collecting taxes, a smashed wooden coffin lies on the floor. Five wound-ridden zombies with lipless mouths and clouded eyes shuffle about the room.

This burial room was looted during Cynidicea's fall. In the years following, trespassers fell prey to the dangers of the tomb complex. They rose again as five zombies that rush to consume entrants.

---

This malodorous chamber is dominated by a polluted fountain sculpted into a five-foot-tall ziggurat. A spout atop the fountain dribbles yellow-brown slime into a pool of burping sludge. A dwarf's shriveled corpse slumps over the pool's edge.

Constructed to honor the ziggurat's architect, this fountain draws from a contaminated reservoir deep underground. Years ago, a thirsty dwarf explorer succumbed to its corrupted waters.
A creature that drinks from the fountain or touches its waters must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or have the poisoned condition for 1 hour. A Purify Food and Drink spell cleans the fountain and causes its waters to run clear for 1 hour. after which its spout resumes its putrid flow.

## B37: Embalming Room

This acrid-smelling room is littered with decrepit wooden tables bowed under the weight of heavy jars. In the corner, rotten winding cloths fill a stone bin.

This room was used for embalming corpses. The jars on the tables contain various chemicals for preserving bodies. When the characters enter, two shadows rise from the floor and attack.
Treasure. One of the jars is a flask of alchemist's fire. The linen bin contains a Potion of Invisibility.

## B38: Lady-in-Waiting's Burial Room

An open ivory coffin lies in a niche on the east wall of this burial room. Frescoes of court life decorate the walls, focusing on the queen's elf handmaiden.

The coffin is empty. It once belonged to Therisina, the queen's lady-in-waiting. Unknown to Queen Zanobis, Therisina secretly loved King Alendria and never overcame her sorrow at his passing. She now haunts his tomb (see area B44). A character who examines the frescoes notices Therisina eying King Alendria with admiration in one scene.

## B39: Councillor's Burial Room

The painted walls of this room depict scenes of a throne room where a well-dressed councilor advises monarchs. In the center of the room lies a wooden coffin riddled with bite marks and a gaping hole.

Four giant rats have chewed a hole in the coffin and made it their den. The coffin is otherwise empty, its contents pilfered long ago. The rats attack anyone who approaches the coffin.

## B40: Southwest Corridor

Near the end of this long corridor, a marble slab with a bronze hand ring bolted to it interrupts the floor.

The slab is a trapdoor. Pulling the ring reveals a ladder down to area B45 on the tier below.
Wandering Spirit. If the characters have not yet encountered King Alendria's spirit in area B29, the ghost appears to them here instead.
Secret Door. The wall north of the trapdoor hides an entrance to the tomb annex (area B41).

## B41: Tomb Annex

Red and white tiles checker the floor of this long corridor, and cracked frescoes of courtly scenes decorate its walls. To the east, the corridor is blocked by a pile of rubble, from which a skeletal hand protrudes.

This sealed annex, accessible via two secret doors at the west end of the corridor, leads to the burial chambers of King Alendria and Queen Zanobis. The annex contains several obstacles designed to deter tomb robbers and other would-be plunderers.
Blade Traps. Three swinging blades are hidden in the ceiling above the squares marked on the map. A successful DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals scrape marks and old bloodstains on the floor beneath each blade. As an action, a character can disarm a blade with a successful DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check using thieves' tools, but failing this check triggers the trap. Creatures can also avoid the blades by not walking under them.
The blades sweep down on each creature that passes under them. The target must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 9 (2d8) slashing damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. After a blade swings, the trap resets.
Rubble. Two stone slabs fell from the ceiling long ago, killing a thief and crumbling into rubble. The thief's skeletal hand sticks out of the rubble. The party can spend 10 minutes clearing the rubble to gain access to the east side of the hall.
Twisting Tunnel. Beyond the rubble is a narrow tunnel just large enough for a Medium creature to squeeze through; it leads to areas B42-B44.

---

Two golden sarcophagi gleam within this hallowed tomb. Precious objects surround them: a gilded chariot, two high-backed thrones, several wooden chests, and exquisite pottery. A mosaic spans the walls, depicting the lives of the monarchs who rest here.

Everything in this tomb is a sham. The sarcophagi are wood painted to look like solid gold, and they contain only chalk-white skeletons made of clay. Though the chests seem to brim with coins and gems, a character who inspects them and succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check learns they are cheap counterfeits and bits of colored glass.
Secret Doors. Secret doors in the north and south walls lead to the true burial chambers of King Alendria (area B44) and Queen Zanobis (area B43).

## B43: Queen Zanobis's Tomb

The cold stone walls of this royal burial chamber honor the last great queen of Cynidicea. Reliefs tell the story of a beloved queen who served her people nobly and received their respect and adoration in turn.
Her sarcophagus, artfully sculpted from white marble, rests on a stone pedestal in the center of the room. It bears the following engraving: "May death claim all who dare desecrate my resting place."

This tomb once contained a treasure trove, which the surviving Cynidiceans plundered long ago. As an action, a character can try to pry open the lid of the sarcophagus, doing so with a successful DC 13 Strength (Athletics) check. If the sarcophagus is opened, Queen Zanobis-now a wight-springs from it and attacks. She wields a scepter instead of a blade, so her melee attacks deal bludgeoning damage instead of slashing damage.
The queen's mind is clouded by rage. As she lashes out at the characters, Queen Zanobis decries them as "ungrateful looters," seeing them as the Cynidiceans who plundered her tomb in years past. If the queen is slain, she crumbles to ash with a grateful sigh, and her spirit is finally put to rest. If the characters later encounter King Alendria's spirit (see area B44), the spirit of Queen Zanobis appears alongside him to thank the characters.
Treasure. Queen Zanobis wears a jeweled crown worth $1,000 \mathrm{gp}$. Her scepter is a fully charged Wand of Paralysis, but if its last charge is expended, the scepter loses its magic. In undeath, Queen Zanobis has forgotten how to access the scepter's magic.

## B44: King Alendria's Tomb

The hall outside this chamber echoes with faint, ethereal sobs. When the characters enter, read:

The chill of death pervades this royal tomb. Its walls depict scenes of the last great king of Cynidicea. An elegant sarcophagus rests in the center of the room.
Suddenly, a weeping elf woman, luminous and incorporeal, rises through the sarcophagus. She floats above the floor in tattered robes, her face wreathed in a tangled mane of wiry hair.

A banshee haunts King Alendria's grave, weeping over the dead monarch centuries after his passing. Characters who saw the frescoes in area B38 recognize the wailing spirit as Queen Zanobis's lady-in-waiting, Therisina. She attacks all who enter.
Kingly Gift. If the characters defeat the banshee, the spirit of King Alendria appears to them and bestows a Charm of Heroism (see the Dungeon Master's Guide) on each character responsible for this act. He then fades away. This gift vanishes from any character who plunders his sarcophagus.
Treasure. King Alendria's tomb was stripped of its riches long ago, except for those inside his sarcophagus. The king's corpse wears a jeweled crown worth $1,000 \mathrm{gp}$ and a suit of plate armor.

## Ziggurat Locations, Tier 5

The fifth tier once served as a temple and city hub. The following locations are keyed to map 2.3.

## B45: SECRET ROOM

A ladder in this room leads up to the trapdoor in area B40. The outline of a secret door to area B46 is visible here. The room is otherwise empty.

## B46: Demetrius's Bedroom

Dust coats this abandoned bedroom and its wooden bed, table, and chair. On the table lie an unlit lantern and a wooden holy symbol of two intertwined snakes. A faintly luminous white robe is draped over the chair.

This was the bedroom of Demetrius, a priest in the Mages of Usamigaras. When the Cult of Zargon corrupted his twin brother, Darius, Demetrius vowed to destroy the cult. However, its hold over Darius proved too great, and Darius assassinated his brother. Demetrius's vengeful spirit now resides within the softly glowing robe.
Secret Doors. The north wall hides two secret doors to areas B45 and B47.

Spiritual Inhabitation. A character who touches the robe must make a DC 16 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, Demetrius's spirit inhabits the character's body, and the robe stops glowing. On a successful save, the character resists the spirit, who can't attempt to inhabit the character for 24 hours.
While inhabiting a host, Demetrius acts like an overbearing passenger and can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect except those that turn Undead. The host remains in control of their actions, but they can hear Demetrius in their mind. The host also inherits the following flaw: "I will stop at nothing to seek vengeance on Darius."
As an action, a host inhabited by Demetrius can ask the spirit to cast one of the following spells (spell save DC 13), requiring no material components: Command, Find Traps, or Lesser Restoration. Once Demetrius casts one of these spells, he can't cast that spell again until the next dawn.
Roleplaying Demetrius. Demetrius zealously recounts the tale of Darius's betrayal to his host. Demetrius despises the Cult of Zargon and mourns Cynidicea's continued decline. He knows the path to his brother's secret office (area B63), but he doesn't know about any of the traps along the way.
Leaving a Host. Demetrius never willingly leaves a host, but his spirit is forced back into the white robe if a host dies or is targeted by the Dispel Evil and Good spell. Demetrius automatically fails his saving throw against any effect that turns Undead, which also forces his spirit back into the robe.
If the robe is destroyed or taken from the ziggurat while Demetrius's spirit resides within it, the spirit finds another object in the ziggurat to inhabit.
If Darius is slain, Demetrius passes to the afterlife, and his robe becomes a Cloak of Protection.
