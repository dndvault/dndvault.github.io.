Diagram 5.1: Well of Questions
The sphinx is knowledgeable about the following topics:

- Everything in this adventure's background
- All the creatures and traps within the pyramid
- All the maze's exits, including those in this room
- Where Amun Sa's staff and star-gem are kept (areas P67 and P68, respectively)
- The mummy lord Nafik (see appendix B) and his descent into evil

Answered Incorrectly. If the characters answer the riddle incorrectly, Senenura attacks and fights ferociously to the death.

Trough. The circular opening at the base of the sphinx's platform is 5 feet in diameter. Medium and smaller creatures that fall into the trough must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be swept into this opening, which empties into area P6.

See diagram 5.1 for a cross-section of this area and its waterways.

Water of Athis. The water in this chamber is the water of Athis (see the "Pyramid Features" section).

Well. Any character who looks into the well sees a 10 -foot-diameter tunnel below the surface that enters the well from the east side. Water flows into the well through this tunnel. Though the volume of water is high, the well's large size makes the current slow and swimmable. This water tunnel angles up to area P29 on the third floor.

## P19: Spear Room

Little holes honeycomb the right wall of this square room, whose domed ceiling is encircled by a narrow ledge. Steel spears pin four humanoid skeletons to the left wall, and a chest sits on the far end of the room.

This room contains a brutal spear trap.
Secret Door. A secret door atop this room's 30 -foot-high ledge leads to an observation dome on the third floor of the pyramid (area P53a).

Spear Trap. Ninety of the one hundred holes in the south wall contain a hidden spear held in place by magic. When a creature enters this room, and every minute afterward until no living creatures or spears remain, ten of the spears shoot from the wall. Creatures in the room when the spears are released must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 28 (8d6) piercing damage, is pinned to the north wall, and has the grappled condition (escape DC 15). On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only.

Treasure. The unlocked chest contains 250 pp .

## P20: X-Room

A giant $X$ has been shallowly carved into the floor of this square room. A narrow ledge encircles the base of the room's domed ceiling.

Secret Door. A secret door atop this room's 30 -foot-high ledge leads to an observation dome on the third floor of the pyramid (area P53b).

Stone Block Trap. A character who searches the room for traps and succeeds on a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check notices the outline of a 10 -footsquare hatch in the ceiling. It is directly above the $X$, which marks a pressure plate in the floor.

Any weight in excess of 40 pounds placed on the $X$ releases a 10 -foot-square stone block from the hatch overhead. Creatures below the block when it drops must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, a creature is pushed to the nearest unoccupied space. On a failed save, it takes 55 (10d10) bludgeoning damage and has the prone and restrained conditions as it is pinned under the block. A creature can use its action to make a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check to free itself or another creature from the block, ending both conditions on a success. The block weighs 2,000 pounds.

## P21: Pendulum Room

A rope hangs from the ceiling of this room; its lower end is tied to the wall facing the doorway. At the other end is a gigantic, bladed pendulum. A narrow ledge encircles the base of the room's domed ceiling.

---

An invisible stalker lurks in this room. When two or more creatures enter the room, the invisible stalker severs the pendulum's rope, causing the blade to sweep down at them. It then attempts to shove creatures into the blade's path.
Pendulum. If the rope securing the pendulum is cut, the blade swings down toward the door and back again. A creature in the swinging blade's path must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 22 (4d10) slashing damage. The blade swings again on initiative count 20 of each round (losing initiative ties), and the damage on subsequent rounds is reduced by 1 d 10 . When the number of damage dice reaches 0 , the blade stops.
Secret Door. A secret door atop this room's 30 -foot-high ledge leads to an observation dome on the third floor of the pyramid (area P53c).
