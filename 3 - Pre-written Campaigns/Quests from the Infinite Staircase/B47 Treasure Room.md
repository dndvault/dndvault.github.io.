# B47: Treasure Room

A subterranean breeze stirs in this room. A large, padlocked chest sits near the north wall. Behind it hangs a tapestry of a desert scene.

The tapestry behind the chest is a hostile mimic. Characters who have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14 or higher notice that despite the breeze, the tapestry remains unnaturally still.
As an action, a character can open the padlocked chest with a successful DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check using thieves' tools.
Secret Door. The south wall holds a secret door to area B46. The outline of the door is visible here.
Treasure. The chest contains $330 \mathrm{gp}, 600 \mathrm{sp}$, and a Potion of Healing (greater).

## B48: Kitchen and Dining Room

This abandoned kitchen and dining room contains stone cupboards, a sagging table, and dusty chairs. Near the table, an enormous snake coils around a bluish corpse wearing a wooden rabbit mask.

The giant constrictor snake strikes at any who interrupt its meal. The cupboards are empty, but the dead Cynidicean's robes contain a full waterskin and two days of rations.

## B49: Living Room

Faded wall hangings, cracked sculptures, and frayed divans decorate this ornate living room. Two rusty iron statues of armored warriors stand at attention, one on either side of the north door.

The two statues are suits of animated armor. Both statues awaken if either door to this room is opened. Created to protect Cynidiceans in this room, the statues are indifferent toward creatures wearing stylized Cynidicean masks and hostile toward all others. The statues never leave the room.

## B50: Consultation Room

Aged planks panel the walls of this antiquated chamber. A desk sits in the center of the room, surrounded by splintering chairs. Two stone statues of winged, lion-headed beasts flank the north door.

Two gargoyles guard this room. The gargoyles are hostile toward the characters but don't pursue them beyond the room.
Treasure. The desk's bottom drawer is locked. As an action, a character can open the drawer with a successful DC 13 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check using thieves' tools. It contains a Potion of Poison. The other drawers contain only aged writing supplies and boring municipal documentation.

## B51: Pit Trap

This intersection contains a 10 -foot-wide, 10 -footdeep pit. The opening is covered by a wooden trapdoor painted to blend into the stone around it. Characters who have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 15 or higher notice the trapdoor.
When a weight greater than 50 pounds is placed on the trapdoor, the door swings downward. Each creature and object on it falls into the pit, taking 3 (Id6) bludgeoning damage from the fall and landing with the prone condition on a pile of brittle bones.

## B52: Abandoned Clerical Quarters

This damp room's interior shimmers faintly, as if seen through clear water. Just inside the doorway is a hostile gelatinous cube. The cube is still digesting the remains of its last meal-a skeleton that appears to float in mid-air, chunks of gooey flesh clinging to its bones. The room is otherwise empty.

## B53: Priests' Quarters

This lived-in room contains three bunk beds and a chest at the foot of each bed. On one bed lies an elf man in bright yellow robes and a wooden sheep mask. An iron-bound chest rests at the foot of each bed.

The masked elf is a doppelganger that killed the Cynidicean it now impersonates. When it becomes aware of the characters, the doppelganger introduces itself as Kastrith, a friendly Cynidicean priest, and volunteers to help the party navigate the ziggurat. The doppelganger aims to split the party and take a character's place by any means necessary.
Chests. The chests are locked. As an action, a character can open a chest with a successful DC 14 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check using thieves' tools. "Kastrith" forbids the characters from opening the chests, claiming they belong to other priests. Inside each chest is a human corpse. Two of the corpses wear bright yellow robes and wooden masks, while the third has neither and looks exactly like the doppelganger's current disguise.

## B54: Storage Room

Two ogres rummage for morsels in this storage room. Candles, incense, and other ceremonial items line its dusty shelves. When the characters enter, the ogres are eating a box of candles. Hungry and unsatisfied, the ogres demand food from all entrants and clobber any who refuse to give it to them.
Treasure. One of the ogres carries an oversized leather sack containing the corpse of an explorer, a Spell Scroll of Comprehend Languages, a dagger clearly used as a toothpick, and 80 gp .

## B55: Hidden Guardroom

Two disheveled humans in stylized rat masks and red robes trimmed with rat fur crouch over a small chest, chattering and counting coins. In the northeast corner of the room, stairs lead downward.

Two wererat thieves in humanoid form divide their recent spoils. When they notice the characters, the wererats throw a cloth over the chest to conceal it and leap to their feet.
