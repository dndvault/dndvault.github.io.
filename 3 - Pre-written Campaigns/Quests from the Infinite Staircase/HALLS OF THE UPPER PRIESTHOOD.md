Map 5.3: Halls of the Upper Priesthood

---

## P30: NORTH ENTRY

A compass rose is carved into the floor of this arched corridor. The compass rose is accurate and can help reorient characters exiting the maze on the pyramid's second floor.
Water of Athis. An aqueduct fills half the corridor, carrying the water of Athis (see the "Pyramid Features" section) toward area P29.

## P31: Long Hall

This long hallway rises steadily toward area P32. Bright light shines from the hallway's southern end.
Water of Athis. An aqueduct carries the water of Athis (see the "Pyramid Features" section) from the stream in the garden hall (area P32) to the north, where it surges high against the wall before following the corridor's sharp turn to the east.

## P32: Garden Hall

A rapid stream runs through this brilliantly lit indoor garden. The room's domed ceiling glows with warm light, giving life to the lush plants along the stream. Nestled among the ferns, flowers, and palm trees in the garden are two enormous bronze bowls filled with leafy pomegranates, pears, figs, and dates.

Sunlight beams down from this room's ceiling.
Secret Doors. The foliage hides secret doors: one in the southwest alcove to area P34 and another in the southeast alcove to area P35. The greenery raises the DC to find these doors to 20.
Fruit Bowls. If the characters approach or disturb a fruit bowl, the magical fruits in the bowls spread their leaves like wings and take flight in all directions like insects. There are fifty flying fruits in all.
A character more than 20 feet off the groundsuch as one climbing a palm tree, flying, or leaping into the air-can use an action to try to snatch a flying fruit from the air, doing so with a successful DC 18 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. Alternatively, a character can shoot down a flying fruit by hitting it with a ranged attack roll; each fruit has Armor Class 18. Once plucked from the air or shot down, a flying fruit becomes inanimate.
A creature that eats a flying fruit has advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws for the next 8 hours. The flying fruit tastes like a deliciously sweet fruit of its apparent variety. If a flying fruit is taken out of the pyramid, it loses its magic and rots 1 minute later.
Water of Athis. The stream flows with the water of Athis (see the "Pyramid Features" section).

## P33: Dome of Flight

The walls of this octagonal room rise high to a domed ceiling that glows with warm light. A waterfall tumbles into the room from the mouth of a stone-carved lion's head, emptying into a stream that flows through the north entrance. A door sits high on the south wall above the lion's head, opening onto a narrow ledge that encircles the base of the domed ceiling.
Four palm trees stand in the room, and clusters of pineapples grow from their leafy tops. Two identical granite altars sit on the east and west sides of a pool. Each altar is carved with the impression of a right hand, a left hand, and gold-lined hieroglyphs. Thick foliage shrouds doors to the east and west.

This chamber's ceiling is 60 feet high and radiates sunlight. The door atop the ledge leads to area P55, while an archway concealed behind the waterfall leads to area P44.
See diagram 5.2 for a cross-section of this room.
Altars. These identical magic altars were used to lift the pharaoh's heavy sarcophagus to the next level of the tomb. Each bears three hieroglyphs. If translated (see the "Pyramid Features" section; treat the hieroglyphs as a single passage), the hieroglyphs read "float," "reverse," and "negate."
If a creature touches both of the hand-shaped impressions, the impressions begin to glow as the altars activate. From then on, any creature in the room can use a bonus action to say one of the following words to cause its corresponding effect:
"Float." Gravity in this room becomes half as strong as normal. Creatures' jump distances are doubled in this room, and creatures and objects that fall descend at a rate of 60 feet per round and take no damage from the fall. Water still flows down the waterfall and through the stream, but at a slower rate than before. This effect can exist simultaneously with the "reverse" effect.
"Reverse." The entire room is affected by a Reverse Gravity spell. The waterfall flows upward, exposing the hidden archway to area P44 and forming an upside-down pond in the ceiling. This effect can exist simultaneously with the "float" effect.
"Negate." If the "float" or "reverse" effects are active, they end immediately. The impressions on the altars stop glowing, and the altars deactivate.
Grenade Palms. The trees are grenade palms, bearing explosive fruits that look like pineapples. The palms evolved this way so they could scatter their seeds far and wide. A character who examines the trees and succeeds on a DC 17 Intelligence (Nature) check recognizes this rare plant.

---

When a creature comes within 5 feet of a grenade palm, the vibrations of the creature's movements loosen one of the explosive fruits overhead. The fruit lands near the base of the tree and bursts in a blast of woody shrapnel. Each creature within 20 feet of the fruit must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) piercing damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.
As an action, character can safely pick a fruit from the tree by gently twisting it off the branches with a successful DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. The character can hurl the fruit up to 60 feet as an action, causing it to burst on impact.
The fruit can be stowed for later use, but doing so is dangerous. If a creature carrying a fruit is hit by an attack or is otherwise jostled, the fruit explodes.
Tapping Noise. A character who stands on the ledge or domed ceiling and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check hears a faint tapping noise coming from the dome's east side. This sound is a gnome named Prit (see area P54), rapping on the other side of the wall with a spoon. This section of the wall has Armor Class 17, 25 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Destroying the wall creates an opening to area P54.
Water of Athis. The water in this room is the water of Athis (see the "Pyramid Features" section).

## P34: Gazelle-Headed Statue

A nine-foot-tall statue of a gazelle-headed woman stands in this alcove. She raises a finger to her mouth.

This statue depicts a god of knowledge unique to the people of Bakar. A character who inspects the statue and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Religion) check knows this god prizes secrets.
Treasure. If a character tells the statue a secret, a Potion of Resistance (necrotic) glitters into existence at the statue's feet. This happens only once.

## P35: Tortoise-Headed Statue

A nine-foot-tall stone statue of a tortoise-headed man stands in this alcove. He holds a hand up to his ear.

This statue depicts a god of art unique to the people of Bakar. A character who inspects the statue and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Religion) check knows this god enjoys music.
Treasure. If a character sings a song or plays a tune before the statue, a Potion of Resistance (necrotic) glitters into existence at the statue's feet. This happens only once.

## P36: West GhAmber

Four leather sacks sit on the floor of this 20 -footlong hallway. Each of the sacks contains 100 gp .

## P37: East Ghamber

The slain bodies of two wights, defeated by Uma and her companions (see area P47), lie sprawled on the floor of this long chamber. A character who inspects the wights notices marks left by swords and arrows on the corpses.

## P38: West Hall

Two wraiths haunt this hallway like sentries. A character looking to traverse the hall undetected must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity (Stealth) check.

## P39: EAST HALL

This quiet hall is empty. Streaks of decades-old dried blood mar the walls and floor.

## P40: West Kitchen

This room is a long-abandoned kitchen, its counters and cutlery coated in a thick layer of dust. In the center of the room, a heavy wooden block has a cleaver stuck into it. The cleaver, which is made of fine silver, functions as a silvered handaxe.

## P41: West Pantry

This pantry is barren. As offerings to the pyramid declined, the priests of Amun Sa ran out of food.
![img-50.jpeg](Quests%20from%20the%20Infinite%20Staircase_img-50.jpeg)

---

## P42: East Kitchen

A dwarf skeleton with a cleaver lodged in its chest lies on a wooden table in this dusty, long-abandoned kitchen. All the kitchen's spoons are missing. They were taken by Prit the gnome (see area P54).

## P43: EAST PANTRY

Piles of plaster-the remnants of long-shattered frescoes-line the walls of this room. No readable pieces are left. Empty flour sacks litter the floor. The room's domed ceiling bears several wide cracks.

This pantry is barren. As offerings to the pyramid declined, the priests of Amun Sa ran out of food.
Ceiling Passageway. Characters who look closely at the cracks in the ceiling see a rough-hewn tunnel rising from one of the larger cracks. The tunnel winds its way to area P64. It was dug with a spoon by Prit, the gnome in area P54.

## P44: MARCH OF THE TRUE FAITH

Hieroglyphs cover the ceiling and floor of this corridor. Chiseled by a scribe to please the pyramid's former high priest, Nafik, the hieroglyphs also tell the story of Nafik's evil designs.
If translated (see the "Pyramid Features" section), the hieroglyphs on the ceiling read as follows:
"Above our thoughts the pharaoh sleeps, In dreamy realms and sky so deep. The high priest worked a wonder great, And sealed him up into his fate. Great Nafik, the priest most high, Studies tomes that he might ply The watery path where all the great Leave death behind and loose their fate."

If translated, the hieroglyphs on the floor read:
"Nafik was high priest of Amun Sa and leader of his rites. He was keeper of the tomes of Terbakar, the greatest library in all lands of the golden age.
"Nafik searched, too, for life eternal, and some say he sought to rob the pharaohs of their right to that life. But I believe he sought only to serve.
"Nafik's search was rewarded, for the books showed him the way of life eternal here. Now great and terrible in his power, he hopes to share this gift with us.
"He cannot die, for he has sequestered his life elsewhere. Nafik is now second only to the gods themselves. He alone has claim on the rule of Bakar."

P45: NORTH PRIESTHOOD CELLS
This long corridor has a wooden door at each end. Ancient, rotting black drapes hang loosely over the entrances to four small rooms on each side of the hall.

The cells contain only dirt and broken cots.

## P46: West Closet

Two unfinished sarcophagi face each other from opposite ends of this long chamber. Two mummies lurk inside the sarcophagi, lurching forth to attack any creatures that enter the room.

## P47: West Cell of the High Priest

The din of battle rises from this room. A heavily armored woman armed with a gleaming sword valiantly battles a horde of gaunt, gray creatures with sharp claws and long, ghastly tongues.

A human knight named Uma is fighting seven ghasts in this octagonal room. Two slain ghasts lie at her feet. If the characters don't immediately join her in battle, Uma shouts for their aid when she notices them.
If the characters help Uma fight off the ghasts, she regards them as comrades. Thankful for their efforts, Uma offers to join the characters if they help her exit the tomb.
What Uma Knows. In addition to the history of Bakar (detailed in this adventure's background), Uma can impart the following information:
Amun Sa's Ghost. Twelve days ago, Uma traveled to the desert with a group of adventurers on a quest for a magic amulet. To their surprise, Uma and her companions were approached by the spirit of Amun Sa. They heeded his plea and entered this pyramid, looking to retrieve his staff and star-gem.
Encounter with a Mummy. Five days ago, Uma and her companions cornered a mummy garbed in tattered high priest's robes near a waterfall not far from here (see area P33). A fierce battle ensued, and Uma's comrades were slain. Uma struck a killing blow on the undead priest-or so she thought. As the mummy crumbled to dust, he claimed his life was "too precious a thing to carry with him," cackling as he disappeared. Uma can show the characters the way to the waterfall.
Uma's Fallen Comrades. Uma laid her companions to rest in a hallway of black curtains (area P51). Since then, she has been surviving on rations, but her supplies are running low. She doesn't know how to get to the tomb's next level.

---

## P48: Priest Catacombs

A giant block of black stone lined with twelve upright sarcophagi sits in the center of this huge room. The faces that were carved into the lids of the sarcophagi have been gouged out by deep claw marks.

The sarcophagi are actually doors to the inside of the stone block, which is hollow. Five wights lurk within. They rush out to attack the characters as soon as any of the lids are opened.
Treasure. An unlocked chest inside the stone block contains 800 gp .

## P49: East Closet

Two sarcophagi face each other from either end of this room. Their carved faces have ominous expressions. An inanimate skeleton falls out of the northern sarcophagus when it's opened.
Secret Door. Inside the southern sarcophagus is a secret door that leads to a dead end.

## P50: East Cell of the High Priest

Three wraiths float within this room. When the characters enter, the wraiths are hissing at a holy-looking mace on the floor. The wraiths attack the characters on sight.

Treasure. The mace is a Mace of Disruption that belonged to an honorable warrior who braved Amun Sa's tomb years ago and perished. The weapon's name ("Bar-ethel") is inscribed in its hilt.

## P51: South Priesthood Cells

This area's description is identical to that of area P45. However, three corpses have been laid behind the curtain in the northeastern-most cell. A motheaten blanket reverently covers each body, and a single, unlit candle rests before them.
The bodies are former adventurers and friends of Uma (see area P47), who dragged her comrades' bodies here to give them a proper burial and hide them from the Undead on this floor.

## P52: Prayer Temple of the Priesthood

Faded and moth-eaten prayer rugs are neatly placed about this room. In the center of the south wall is a thirty-foot-tall statue of Amun Sa with a giant gemstone glimmering from his forehead. A compass rose is carved into the floor before the statue.

The compass rose is accurate and can help reorient characters who lost track of the cardinal directions in the maze on the second floor.

UMA, a valiant warrior who heeded Amun Sa's call, fends off a horde of ghosts.

---

Gemstone Trap. If the gemstone is removed from the statue's forehead, the statue makes a horrendous noise like a foghorn until the gem is put back or the statue is destroyed. The statue has Armor Class 17, 50 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. The noise attracts nearby creatures. Roll on the Random Upper Priesthood Encounters table (detailed earlier in this section) to determine what creatures arrive to investigate the noise.

Trapdoor. A hidden, 10 -foot-wide trapdoor sits between the compass rose and the statue. A character who examines the floor and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check spots the trapdoor. A creature that steps onto the trapdoor falls 40 feet into the haystack in area P22, taking no damage from the fall.

Treasure. The "gemstone" in the statue's forehead is made of glass and worth only 1 gp . Characters who have proficiency with jeweler's tools recognize this, as does anyone who holds it and succeeds on a DC 13 Intelligence (Investigation) check.

## P53: Observation Domes

Dark, dusty corridors lead to these domes, whose doors open onto the ledges over various rooms in the Maze of Mists. Priests used them to pass idle hours watching the deaths of grave robbers below.
![img-51.jpeg](Quests%20from%20the%20Infinite%20Staircase_img-51.jpeg)

Diagram 5.3: Observation Dome

See diagram 5.3 for a cross-section of a typical observation dome and its view over the area below.
P53a. This dome opens over room P19.
P53b. This dome opens over room P20.
P53c. This dome opens over room P21.
P53d. This dome opens over room P26.
P53e. This dome opens over room P27.
P53f. This dome opens over room P28.

## GAUNTLET

This floor of the pyramid-the Gauntlet-served as a last line of defense between intruders and the pharaoh's tomb. It also served as the quarters of the pyramid's former high priest, Nafik (see appendix B).
The following locations are keyed to map 5.4.

## P54: Prit's Tunnel

If the party discovers this tunnel by traveling from the Heart's Lair (area P64), read or paraphrase:

The walls of this tunnel are rough and narrow, as if dug by a small creature. At the end of the tunnel stands a gnome, humming happily to himself as he chips away at the wall with a spoon.

If the party discovers this tunnel by breaking down the wall in the Dome of Flight (area P33), read:

When the dust clears, a surprised gnome stands in a rough-hewn tunnel before you, holding a dingy spoon.

This squirrelly gnome commoner is named Prit. He snuck into the tomb five years ago to admire its architecture and has been happily tunneling through these ruins ever since. Prit is obsessed with spoons and doesn't know much about anything else. He does know that down the rough-hewn corridor behind him there's "a weird little treasure" (see area P64). Prit doesn't elaborate further, electing to show the characters the spoons he has collected instead.
Treasure. Prit carries a collection of one hundred and twelve spoons in his backpack. Many are mundane, but others are historical curios. If sold to the right buyer, the collection could fetch up to 350 gp , but Prit doesn't part with it willingly.

## P55: Entry Corridor

An unsettling chill pervades this branching corridor. The two doors to the south are identical. They are both made of thick wood and bear gold hieroglyphs.
Hieroglyphs. If translated (see the "Pyramid Features" section), the hieroglyphs read as follows:
"Beyond these doors lies the great Nafik, once second only to the pharaoh-now second only to the gods."

---

The well-lit hall before you is vast and majestic, rising at a slight angle toward the south. Wall torches light four flights of stairs that connect wide landings. Water thunders in torrents past both sides of the stairs and underneath these landings. At the top of the stairs is a platform, on which rests a giant bronze forearm with an upraised fist.

An imposing figure stands beside this bronze arm. He is wrapped almost entirely in tattered priestly attire that trails at his feet, but a few gaps between the wrappings reveal his rotting, desiccated skin.

The figure casts his gaze at you and says in a raspy voice, "Foolish beings of living flesh, your journey ends here. Once, I was the pharaoh's high priest-but now, I enjoy immortality that even he could never hope to attain. Revel in this moment: the rushing water of Athis, the smell of burning torches. It is the last scene you will ever witness."

Nafik (see appendix B), the heartless former high priest of Amun Sa, stands at the top of the stairs. As soon as Nafik is done monologuing-or if his speech is interrupted-he attacks.
If the characters try to explain to Nafik that Amun Sa sent them, he responds that the pharaoh is dead. Nafik considers himself the rightful inheritor of the tomb, its contents, and the kingdom of Bakar.
Bronze Arm. When combat begins, the bronze arm atop the stairs animates to defend Nafik. On initiative count 20 of each round (losing initiative ties), Nafik can command the arm to grab or push a creature of his choice that he can see within 10 feet of the arm. The target must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target has the grappled condition (escape DC 15) or is pushed into the rapids below (Nafik's choice). The arm has Armor Class 19, 30 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.
Destroying Nafik. Nafik's heart resides in area P64. To vanquish the high priest for good, the characters must first destroy his heart. If Nafik is reduced to 0 hit points while his heart remains intact, he cackles and crumbles to ash, knowing he will rise again. If his heart was previously destroyed, Nafik's lifeless body slumps to the floor, his face twisted into a permanent scowl.
Gauntlet. Each landing in this chamber has an effect that triggers when a creature other than Nafik steps foot on it. Each effect triggers only once.
From north to south, the landings' effects are as follows:
![img-52.jpeg](Quests%20from%20the%20Infinite%20Staircase_img-52.jpeg)

MAP 5.4: GAUNTLET
North Landing. Two ochre jellies ooze from small holes in the east and west alcoves of this landing. They are loyal to Nafik and fight to the death.
Center Landing. A 30 -foot-tall, 50 -foot-wide wall of flame erupts from the floor in the middle of this landing, dividing the northern and southern halves of the room. The wall is opaque and lasts for 1 minute or until dispelled by a Dispel Magic spell (DC 15). A creature that passes through the wall must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.
South Landing. A number of shadows equal to the number of characters appear from the southernmost alcoves. Each shadow is a wispy duplicate of a character intent on killing its original.
If the characters entered from the south, or if they don't try to ascend the stairs, Nafik can instead trigger one of these effects at the start of his turn (no action required). He can trigger each effect only once.
Rapids. Two 10 -foot-deep aqueducts surge with water 10 feet below the landings. This water is the water of Athis (see the "Pyramid Features" section).
A creature that falls into an aqueduct is swept to the northern end of the room and slams against the ledge face, taking 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage. A creature can climb from the water level onto the north landing without needing to make any checks.

---

Water flows into the room from area P57, entering through a forked, 10 -foot-wide channel beneath the frothy rapids. It flows out through sturdy grates in the northern ledge face, eventually emerging from the lion's head spout in area P33.

P57: Pillar of Athis

A ten-foot-diameter column of water thunders down from the ceiling of this semicircular room, pouring into an opening in the floor.

If the characters visit this room before destroying Nafik and his heart (see areas P56 and P64), the chamber is covered with thick grime. A deep voice emanates from the water column and utters the following message in Common:
"A terrible evil befouls this place. A wicked priest haunts these halls, his heart preserved in glass by foul magic. Those who end his undeath may return and face the Trial of Truth."

Once Nafik and his heart have been destroyed, the grime in this room disappears to reveal a question mark engraved in the floor before the column.
Column of Water. This water column flows with the water of Athis (see the "Pyramid Features" section). A creature that steps into the column is abruptly swept through a duct into the rapids in area P56.
Trial of Truth. If a creature asks a question in this room after Nafik and his heart have been destroyed, a deep voice speaks from the column and asks three questions. The questions are as follows:

- "What is your name?"
- "What is your quest?"
- "On whose hallowed ground do you stand?" (The answer is "Amun Sa's.")
If a creature answers any of the questions inaccurately or lies, lightning leaps from the column of water toward that creature. The target must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 45 (10d8) lightning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. If a question is answered truthfully, the voice proceeds to the next question until all three are answered.
After all three questions have been answered truthfully, read or paraphrase the following text:
"Put your hand in mine," says the column. A glowing impression of a hand appears on the floor before it.

Nafik, the undead former high priest of Amun Sa, spews a dastardly monologue in the Gauntlet of the True Way.

---

If a character places a hand into the impression, the water column flows backward for the next 10 minutes. Creatures that enter the column are gently ushered up to area P65.

## P58: Reading Room

The walls, ceiling, and floor of this room are made of marble. They might once have been beautiful, but now they're covered in cobwebs, dirt, and grime. An old, scorched book lies on a marble slab in the center of the room.

This untitled book details how one can become a mummy lord through a complex ritual that involves numerous unspeakable acts and vile ingredients. Some of its pages are burnt and illegible, while others have been torn out.
Nafik tried to transform himself into a mummy lord using this book's ritual, but he lacked the requisite time and ingredients. His botched ritual transformed him into an unholy creature and his most loyal priests into Undead.

## P59: Stagnant Pool

A pool of stagnant water rests in this octagonal room. Three hostile water weirds lurk in the pool.
Treasure. A waterproof bag containing 110 pp lies at the bottom of the pool, obscured by the water's grimy surface. Once Nafik and his heart have been destroyed, the grime in this room disappears.

## P60: Sitting Room

This octagonal room holds a bench, a chair, and a rug. The room otherwise contains nothing of value.

## P61: Dining Room

Cobwebs cover this grand dining room for Amun Sa's priests. Characters who peruse the room's cabinets notice all the spoons are missing. They were taken by Prit the gnome (see area P54).
Treasure. The ornate plates and silverware in this room are worth a total of 110 gp .

## P62: Storage Room

The north wall of this room has been broken through, with rubble and dirt piled on the floor. A rough-hewn tunnel twists north from the opening.

Two earth elementals created by Nafik dug this tunnel under his instructions. They eventually hollowed out a cavern to safeguard the high priest's heart (see area P64).

## P63: Burial Chamber

Six open sarcophagi rest in this octagonal room. This room was supposed to be the burial place of Nafik and the other priests of Amun Sa, but Nafik transformed them all into Undead with his foul ritual. The sarcophagi are empty.

## P64: Heart's Lair

The walls of this cavern are rough and irregular. Jumbled blocks of stone are strewn about the floor. Two large creatures made of solid earth stand imposingly before an alcove in the cavern's northeast corner.

Nafik keeps his heart in a glass bell jar in the cavern's northeast cave. It's guarded by two earth elementals. The elementals stand in stony silence unless intruders approach the northeastern alcove, at which point they attack.
Nafik's Heart. The heart's glass jar is sealed to the floor in the northeast cave and can be smashed easily. The heart inside looks like an ordinary human heart, beating steadily. Nafik's heart has Armor Class 5 and 5 hit points. If the heart is destroyed, Nafik's Rejuvenation trait ceases to function.

## Tomb of Amun Sa

The following locations are keyed to map 5.5.

## P65: The Pharaoh's True Way

The characters can enter this room only after completing the Trial of Truth (see area P57). When they arrive, read or paraphrase the following text:

The water lifts you up the shaft into the south end of this corridor and splashes around exuberantly. This corridor ends in a set of elegant bronze double doors.

After 10 minutes, the water returns to its normal downward flow. The water enters the shaft from a hole just below the floor of the corridor.
Water of Athis. The water in this room is the water of Athis (see the "Pyramid Features" section).

## P66: Treasury of the Pharaohs

A reed boat spans the length of the western wall of this stone treasury. Several jars rest inside the boat, whose bow features an empty, fist-sized indent.

A mural on the east wall depicts the boat sailing on the clouds with a glittering gemstone in its bow.

The containers in the boat are canopic jars.

---

Magic Mural. This magic mural is a portal. A character who inspects the mural and succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence (Arcana) check can tell that the mural is magical, and a Detect Magic spell reveals an aura of conjuration magic around it.
Passing through the mural teleports a creature to area P67, thousands of feet above the pyramid. A character who touches the painting finds that their hand passes right through it, and they feel cold air on the other side. A character who sticks their head through it finds themself looking out over the desert landscape, as if through a window in the sky.

## P67: Floating Boat

When the characters first look through the mural in area P66, read or paraphrase the following text:

You peer from a hazy portal high above the desert. Thousands of feet in the sky, the air is thin and cold. Just beneath the portal floats a layer of sparse clouds, and the pyramid is but a tiny speck directly below you. An exact copy of the boat from the treasury floats thirty feet from you, perfectly still. The large gemstone from the painting is set in its bow, and ten ornate vases rest within it.
![img-53.jpeg](Quests%20from%20the%20Infinite%20Staircase_img-53.jpeg)

Map 5.5: Tomb of Amun Sa

This portal and floating boat are located 10,000 feet in the air, directly above the pyramid. The floating boat is 30 feet from the portal. The boat is fixed to its position; no amount of force can move it.
The gemstone in the boat's bow is the star-gem of Mo-Pelar, one of the two treasures the characters require to fulfill Amun Sa's quest. It can be removed from its niche on the floating boat with a gentle twist. Characters might retrieve the gem by one of the following means:

- Flying or teleporting to the boat
- Grabbing the gem with a spell such as Mage Hand
- Lassoing the boat with a rope and shimmying across with a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check
Falling. A creature that falls from the boat or the portal plummets 10,000 feet to the ground; it takes 70 (20d6) bludgeoning damage and has the prone condition at the base of the pyramid.
Treasure. The star-gem of Mo-Pelar lodged into the floating boat is a Gem of Seeing. The ten ornate vases in the boat each contain 200 pp (for a total of $2,000 \mathrm{pp}$ ). Each vase weighs 15 pounds.


## P68: The Pharaoh's Tomb

A grand sarcophagus lies in the center of this room, with a golden staff set across it. In the center of the north wall stands a statue of Amun Sa with a stone replica of a gem held its outstretched right hand and a stone replica of the staff held across its body with its left hand. Hieroglyphs adorn the walls.

This is the true tomb of Amun Sa. Inside the ornate sarcophagus lies the pharaoh's mummified body, dressed in time-worn ceremonial clothing.
Hieroglyphs. If translated (see the "Pyramid Features" section), the hieroglyphs read as follows:
"A passage is always provided between the tomb of the king and his likeness, whereby his spirit may pass into his ordained statue and live within the stone we worship in the outer world."

Treasure. The staff lying atop the sarcophagus is the Staff of Ruling (see appendix A), one of the two treasures needed to fulfill the pharaoh's quest.
One-Way Teleport. After retrieving both of the pharaoh's implements, the characters are teleported to area P2. If the characters are on good terms with the Tears of Athis, Iaseda commends them on their successful quest. The Tears of Athis then rush from the pyramid to see if the curse has been lifted.

---

![img-54.jpeg](Quests%20from%20the%20Infinite%20Staircase_img-54.jpeg)

## CONCLUSION

If the characters leave the tomb with both the Staff of Ruling (see appendix A) and the star-gem of MoPelar, read or paraphrase the following text:

Silence hangs heavy in the still, dry air. Time seems to have stopped, holding all the world in the balance. The pharaoh's ghostly figure hovers on the horizon.

Distant thunder rollls gently across the far-flung sands. The horizon blurs as a whirlwind begins to spin around the massive pyramid. Swirling wind and sand sing past you, a chorus of a thousand voices: the hopes and cries of a land long dead, and the name of its long-accursed pharaoh-Amun Sa. You hear his earnest voice echo in your mind amid the jarring crescendo, saying:
"You have done what others could not; you have put my soul and the souls of my people to rest. The curse upon this land is ended. Keep my staff, my star-gem, and all the treasure you have found within my tomband know that you will forever have my gratitude."

The sandstorm settles, and all is still once more. The pharaoh's ghost is gone. From below, you hear the cool sound of running water. As the dusty air clears, it reveals a large basin now overflowing with spring-clear water that surges along a channel toward the horizon. It will take time to heal this land, but there will be blossoms in the spring, for the river has returned from its exile-and with it comes life.

The characters have also earned the gratitude of Iaseda and the Tears of Athis. As a reward for completing Amun Sa's quest, the characters may keep any magic items or treasure they recovered from the pyramid, though the Tears of Athis ask the characters to leave any items of cultural, historical, or religious significance inside the pyramid.
In the months that follow, the Tears of Athis spread word of party's deeds and work to build a thriving society in the region so the descendants of Bakar may return and flourish alongside the river's restorative waters again.
