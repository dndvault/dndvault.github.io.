# The Last Caverns of Tsojcanth

EEEP IN THE YATIL MOUNTAINS LIE THE LoSt Caverns of Tsojcanth (SAWJ-kahn), formerly occupied by the legendary archmage Iggwilv the Witch Queen. Though Iggwilv is long gone, her lair is anything but empty. Demons, dragons, and other formidable creatures haunt the perilous caverns and the mountains that conceal them, and the archmage's untold defenses remain intact. Iggwilv is rumored to have amassed a magical hoard of unsurpassed value, a trove of such fame that scores of adventurers have perished in search of it.
Despite the decades since her disappearance, Iggwilv's impact persists in the caverns, where she is believed to have penned, at least in part, the Demonomicon of Iggwilv: her infamous treatise on the infinite layers of the Abyss and its inhabitants. Abyssal rifts-the byproducts of past magical experiments-leak demonic energy into the tunnels, and guardians bound from faraway planes await rescue or defend the caverns from thieves and trespassers. Other creatures have simply taken up residence in the cave system, adding to its dangers.
"The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth" is designed for four to six 9 th-level characters.

## BACKGROUND

Iggwilv carved out a kingdom for herself through magical prowess, strength, and wit, bolstered by a horde of demons bound by magic to further her aims. In her quest for absolute power, Iggwilv accumulated countless enemies determined to destroy her. Among these was the demon lord Graz'zt, whom the archmage imprisoned for a time. Eventually, Iggwilv's ambitions proved excessive, and a climactic battle with Graz'zt broke her power. The Witch Queen then vanished. As her evil influence waned, Iggwilv's realm was sundered, and her lair, the Caverns of Tsojcanth, was lost.
This lost lair purportedly lies deep in a series of caverns somewhere in the Yatil Mountains. Clues to the lair's whereabouts and fragments of the treasures within have surfaced over the last few decades, and three nations that border the mountains where it hides now race to claim Iggwilv's hoardor, if they can't claim it, at least ensure that their rivals don't either.

A DoOR TO THE Lost CAVERNS
The margrave of a nation near the mountains has promising leads on the location of the caverns, thanks to a few expeditions in recent years. Most of the agents the margrave sent out never returned; others came back battle worn and empty-handed, save for harrowing tales of the horrors in the caves. The margrave now seeks adventurers made of sterner stuff undertake the quest.

## Using the Infinite Staircase

If you're using Nafas as a patron, he summons the characters to the Censer of Dreams (detailed in chapter 1), where he recounts the following wish:
"A desperate nation seeks a trove of immeasurable worth, amassed by an archmage unmatched. Many have died in search of it. Summon your bravery and journey to her lair, returning with lost knowledge, power, and wealth."

Nafas then teleports the characters to a door along the Infinite Staircase that opens into a roadside inn near the Yatil Mountains, where a ruler searching for the Lost Caverns has placed an agent to recruit for the venture. After the adventure, the characters can return to the staircase via the same portal.

## Adventure Hooks

If you're not using Nafas as a group patron, consider the following ways to involve the characters in this adventure:

Lost Light. A powerful curse plunges a nearby nation into strife. Rumor claims the light of Daoud's Wondrous Lanthorn (see appendix A) is the key to breaking the curse. A ruler who believes the lantern is in the Lost Caverns sends an agent to recruit the characters to retrieve it.
Racing Rivals. The margrave of a land near the Yatil Mountains seeks to weaken his political rivals without drawing suspicion. Having heard of the party's exploits, he hires the characters as independent agents to find Iggwilv's lair and its potent treasures before the forces of neighboring nations find them.

## Setting the Adventure

On the world of Oerth in the Greyhawk campaign setting, the Lost Caverns hide within in the southern Yatil Mountains, nestled between the nations of Ket and Perrenland, with Bissel to the south. The margrave of the March of Bissel has uncovered clues to the Lost Caverns' location.
You can set the adventure in a different world by placing it in any mountain range near a kingdom or settlement-before her disappearance, Iggwilv's influence spanned multiple worlds and planes of existence. Consider the following suggestions:
Eberron. The nations of Aundair, Breland, and Thrane vie to explore the Lost Caverns in the Blackcap Mountains. Iggwilv's experiments there drew power from the depths of Khyber.
Forgotten Realms. The Lost Caverns are hidden in the Sunset Mountains, northeast of Proskur along the High Road. The High Overseer of Elturel hires the characters to locate the caverns.

## Adventure Summary

"The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth" begins with a meeting between the characters and an agent serving the margrave of a nation whose rivals surround the Yatil Mountains, where the Lost Caverns are believed to be hidden. Whether the margrave covets one of Iggwilv's treasures for himself, seeks to sponsor the adventurers, or wants the characters to prevent his rivals from claiming the hoard first, the agent offers what little information they have about the caverns' whereabouts.
While navigating treacherous mountain passes, the characters must avoid rockslides, contend with roaming monsters or the patrols of the rival nations, and perhaps encounter friendly faces as they search for the entrance to the Lost Caverns. Danger-filled caverns await the characters in Iggwilv's former lair. Bloodthirsty monsters and the deadly remnants of the archmage's power stand between the characters and the Witch Queen's hoard, which is guarded by the greatest of Iggwilv's treasures-her daughter, the vampire warrior Drelnza.

## Character Advancement

If you want to use story-based level advancement, the characters receive experience points for achieving the following milestones rather than defeating monsters:
Entering the Greater Caverns. The characters gain 1 level when they enter the greater caverns for the first time.
Encountering Drelnza. After the characters encounter the vampire Drelnza for the first time, everyone in the party who survives the encounter gains 1 level.
If you follow this method, the characters should reach 11th level by the adventure's conclusion.

## ABOUT THE ORIGINAL

Published in 1982, the official Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth module was an expanded and revised version of The Lost Caverns of Tsojconth, a tournament adventure Gary Gygax created for Winter Con V in 1976. The adventure offers tantalizing details of the story of Iggwilv the Witch Queen-better known as the archmage Tasha, famous for her Hideous Laughter spell. The adventure featured Drelnza, the vampire daughter of Iggwilv, and debuted the lightningbreathing behir, which appeared on its stunning cover.
