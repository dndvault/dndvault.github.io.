---

The wererats initially behave amicably toward the characters and claim to be Cynidiceans who lost their way in the monument-a ruse to buy time so they can rob the characters.
When the conversation stalls, the wererats spring on the characters. The wererats are cowardly; when reduced to half its hit points or fewer, a wererat transforms into a giant rat and attempts to flee.
Stairs. If you're running the extended adventure (see the "Extending the Adventure" section), the stairs lead down to a tunnel that exits into the Mouth of Zargon (area B64 of the expanded ziggurat). Otherwise, they end in a bricked-up wall.
Treasure. The chest contains 40 gp and four small agates worth 20 gp each.

## B56: Temple

This temple has fallen into disrepair. Ornate mosaics decorate its walls, and decrepit benches line its broad aisle. At the end of the aisle stands a dais with three toppled statues. Two women in elaborate clothing and copper fox masks inspect the rubble.

The women atop the dais are jackalweres disguised as human Cynidiceans. Sisters and charlatans, the two happened on the ziggurat and began scouring it for valuables. The siblings are insufferably vain but ultimately indifferent toward the characters.
When the sisters notice the characters, they bow and introduce themselves as Chana and Vana, potion sellers extraordinaire. The charlatans try to sell the characters fake potions-glittering bottles advertised as "rare and magical elixirs" with outlandish properties-for anything precious the characters can offer. A Detect Magic spell reveals the potions as fakes. If confronted, the sisters flee, defending themselves as necessary. Failing that, they attempt to wangle their freedom through bribery and deceit.
Treasure. Chana and Vana each wear a copper fox mask worth 10 gp and two pieces of jewelry worth 150 gp apiece. The sisters' knapsack is full of counterfeit potions.

## B57: Entrance Hall

Two rows of pillars, each carved in the likeness of a different past ruler, support the high ceiling of this grand entrance hall. A breathtaking mosaic spans the walls, depicting the rise and fall of an ancient civilization.

A thin layer of sand coats the floor; it grows thicker near the two enormous stone doors on the north wall. Two spoked platforms stand beside the doors.

The doors to this entrance hall have been sealed for centuries. Though the ziggurat is normally covered by mountains of sand, the dunes have temporarily shifted. These main doors can be opened from the inside if two creatures simultaneously turn the spoked platforms and both creatures succeed on a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. The doors then slowly swing inward, accompanied by the sound of grating stone and a deluge of sand.
If the characters leave the ziggurat, proceed to this adventure's conclusion.
Mosaic. The mosaic on the walls shows the history and fall of Cynidicea (detailed at the beginning of this adventure). It features the following events:

- Early Cynidiceans construct a great stone city.
- King Alendria and Queen Zanobis reign, and the city prospers.
- A ziggurat is raised in the monarchs' honor.
- Workers dig beneath the ziggurat, unearthing a tentacled, one-eyed monster with a jagged horn.
- The Cynidiceans bow to the creature in worship.
- As the city falls to invaders, its citizens flee underground and don strange masks.
Entrance to the Underground City. If you're playing the expanded adventure (see the "Extending the Adventure" section), a plainly visible trapdoor in the northwest corner of the room leads down to the underground city. Otherwise, the trapdoor doesn't exist.


## B58: Acid Pit

The floor of this sunken room is filled with a 6 -footdeep pool of vaporific acid. A creature that enters the pool for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 22 (4d10) acid damage.
A corroded metal box bobs in the hissing pool; its padlocked lid protrudes above the liquid's surface.
Treasure. The box's padlock breaks if touched. Inside is a Spell Scroll of Levitation and 200 sp.

## B59: Storage Room

Wine racks line this storage room. Along the west wall stand casks and barrels, several of which have been smashed and drained. A hulking, feathered creature with ursine paws staggers amid the debris.

A disoriented owlbear, ravenously hungry and drunk on wine, has ransacked this storage room. If not fed immediately, the owlbear attacks. A character who feeds the owlbear and succeeds on a DC 14 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check calms the creature, changing its attitude to indifferent.
Treasure. The room contains four hundred bottles of Cynidicean wine, collectively worth 100 gp .

---

Six humanoids sit motionless in this room, each clad in dark robes and a golden, horned mask with tentacles dangling from its chin. The figures gaze silently into a tarnished bronze basin filled with sludge.

The masked figures are six cultists of Zargon. Mesmerized by a visage of their overlord reflected in a bowl of slime, the cultists are indifferent toward the characters. If disturbed, the cultists become hostile.
Non-cultists who gaze into the basin glimpse the nightmarish face of Zargon and must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or have the frightened condition for 1 minute. A creature that fails the saving throw can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
If a character looks into the basin, the cultists snap out of their stupor and attack. They drag any defeated characters to Darius's office (area B63).
Treasure. The six cultists each wear a gold mask of Zargon worth 50 gp .

## B61: Party Room

Spongy fungi blanket the walls and floor this damp chamber. Amid clouds of spores, nine masked humanoids dance with invisible partners, intermittently chuckling and muttering in conversation. Branching up from the center of the room is a limbed, fungal pillar studded with yellow eyes.

Nine Cynidiceans (commoners) revel quietly in this fungal room. To escape their bleak existence, the Cynidiceans have partnered with a myconid sovereign. In exchange for the Cynidiceans tending its garden, the myconid facilitates group melds vivid, shared dreams that provide entertainment and social interaction. As the partygoers meld, they are blissfully unaware of the characters.
When the characters enter, the sovereign invites them to participate in the meld. If they accept, the sovereign exudes a cloud of hallucinatory spores, drawing the characters into the Cynidiceans' shared dream. For 1 minute, the characters taste the former splendor of Cynidicea as the room around them appears to melt away, replaced by an ornate ballroom filled with joyful citizens in fanciful attire.
If the characters decline, the sovereign allows them to continue onward, asking only that they don't interrupt the meld. Attacking the sovereign shatters the illusion and angers the Cynidiceans, who join the sovereign in driving the characters out by force.

B62: Gambling Room

Brightly robed gamblers in animal masks play games of chance in this weathered gambling den, exchanging coins and jewelry from an older era. Four cultists, clad in golden masks with tentacled chins, oversee them.

Some surviving Cynidiceans gamble the fortunes of their lost kingdom in this secluded room. Twelve masked commoners play games here, supervised by four cultists of Zargon.
If trouble breaks out in this room, Darius and two more cultists barge out of area B63, swords at the ready. The gamblers try to abstain from combat.
Dice Game. The gamblers are playing an ancient dice game called Madarua's harvest. They welcome the characters to join in. The buy-in is 5 gp per game. The game's rules are as follows:

- Each player rolls three d6s.
- A player who rolls three of a kind wins.
- If no player rolls three of a kind, each player must either add another 5 gp to the pot or forfeit. The remaining players roll one or two of their d6s again, repeating these steps until someone wins or only one player remains, winning by default.
- If multiple players simultaneously roll three of a kind, the player with the highest number on their dice wins. If the numbers are the same, it's a tie, and the winners divide the pot evenly.
After each game, a cultist approaches the table and demands a 1 gp "tax" from the winner. If the winner refuses, the cultists forcefully escort them through the secret door to Darius's private office (area B63).

Treasure. The room's occupants collectively hold $255 \mathrm{gp}, 610 \mathrm{sp}$, three banded agates worth 25 gp each, and four pieces of jewelry worth 100 gp each. Additionally, the four cultists each wear a gold mask of Zargon worth 50 gp .

## B63: Darius's Office

A human cultist in a horned, tentacled mask lounges in this decadent office, counting treasure piled atop an aged desk. Two more cultists in simpler robes and identical masks stand behind him, daggers drawn.

Darius (chaotic evil, human cult fanatic) and two cultists of Zargon lurk in this office, counting coins confiscated from Cynidicean gamblers. They are hostile toward anyone not garbed in their cult's attire.
If a character is wearing Demetrius's white robe, Darius exclaims:
"By the crooked horn of Zargon! Do my eyes deceive me? Has the ghost of my brother come to die again?"

Darius and his cohorts fight to the death.
Treasure. Atop Darius's desk are 50 gp, three gems worth 25 gp each, and two jeweled necklaces worth 100 gp each. Darius and the two cultists each wear a gold mask of Zargon worth 50 gp .

## CONCLUSION

The adventure ends when the characters escape the ziggurat, likely via the main entrance in area B57. Depending on what brought the party to the ruins, they might eventually rejoin their desert caravan or return to their quest-giver to report their findings.
If your players wish to continue exploring the ruins of Cynidicea or the underground city beneath the ziggurat, consult the following section.

## Extending THE ADVENTURE

"The Lost City" primarily explores the first five tiers of the ziggurat, but further adventures await those who continue their descent. This section provides the following two options to extend the adventure:
Expanded Ziggurat. This section adds a sixth tier to the ziggurat: the seeping lair of the elder evil Zargon and its cultists.
The Underground City. This section presents an overview of the Cynidiceans' underground city and opportunities for adventure therein.

---

## Expanded Ziggurat

In the days of Cynidicea's fall, the elder evil Zargon slithered up into the city and fed on the panicking masses. As its cult took over the city, Zargon returned to the tunnels below the ziggurat, content to feed on a steady supply of Cynidicean sacrifices brought by its worshipers. Zargon dwells there still, rising from its slimy pool to answer the growl of its stomach.
An unfinished tier occupied by Zargon and its loathsome servitors lies deep below the ziggurat. This tier is far more dangerous than those above it. A confrontation with Zargon could prove challenging for characters of all levels, though unseasoned adventurers determined to face the Returner in combat are almost certainly doomed to fail.
Characters killed by Zargon might be resurrected on the Infinite Staircase by Nafas (see chapter 1), who could ask them to repay him by completing another adventure in this book.

## Expanded Ziggurat Features

Unless otherwise noted, this tier has the following features:
Ceilings. Corridors have 15 -foot-high ceilings, and rooms have 20 -foot-high ceilings.
Doors. Translucent membranes curtain the entrances to each area. Creatures that pass through a membrane are coated in a mucilaginous glaze.
Lighting. Bulbous growths cling to walls throughout. Their pulsing, sickly glow provides dim light. Slime. A film of sticky slime covers most surfaces.

## RANDOM ENCOUNTERS

For each hour the party spends on this level, roll a d6. On a roll of 1 , the characters encounter $1 \mathrm{~d} 4+1$ cultists led by a cult fanatic looking for sacrifices. Each cult member wears a gold mask of Zargon worth 50 gp .

## Expanded Ziggurat Locations

The following locations are keyed to map 2.4.

## B64: MOUTH OF ZARGON

Two holes draped in sagging blankets of slime punctuate the floor of this unfinished chamber. The walls, riddled with oozing cracks, bear murals of humanoids in mourning. Rusty mining tools lie strewn about.

A black pudding creeps along the ceiling. It attempts to plop onto one of the characters and drag them into one of the slimy chutes on the floor.
Slime Chutes. Two 10 -foot-wide, 40 -foot-long tunnels, each covered by a thin web of slime, lead down
to areas B66 and B67. A creature that moves over a pit must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or slide down the chute, landing with the prone condition in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of the chute's exit. A creature can choose to fail this saving throw. Clambering back up a chute requires a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.

## B65: Ritual Chamber

Eleven robed cultists chant within this ritual chamber. Each wears a horned, golden mask with four metallic tentacles sprouting from its chin. The cultists gather around a black marble altar supported by six sculpted tentacles. A twelfth cultist convulses atop the altar.

Twelve cultists perform a wicked ritual in this room. The cultists are hostile toward intruders but continue intoning even in combat-only death can separate the Zargonites from their goal. The cultist on the pedestal refrains from joining combat until the ritual is complete; if they are killed, another cultist takes their place on the altar.
The ritual continues for 3 rounds or until all cultists have been dispatched. A Silence spell that envelops all the cultists also stops the ritual.
If one or more cultists are still chanting at the end of round 3, the cultist on the altar (or closest to it) transforms into a gibbering mouther with all its hit points. Read or paraphrase the following text:
"I have been chosen! Praise the Returner!" shouts the cultist on the altar with glee as they melt into an amorphous blob of chattering teeth and darting eyes.

Treasure. The twelve cultists each wear a gold mask of Zargon worth 50 gp .

## B66: Cultists' Quarters

Twelve uncomfortable bunk beds, sticky and freckled with mold, line the walls of these sleeping quarters. Beneath four of the beds hang throbbing cocoons of stringy slime. A chest rests at the foot of each bed.

Low-ranking members of the Cult of Zargon sleep in these communal chambers.
Cocoons. Four clammy cocoons, ready to burst, stick to the bottoms of four beds. If a creature disturbs a cocoon or moves within 10 feet of it, the cocoon bursts. Each creature within 10 feet of a bursting cocoon must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take $9(2 \mathrm{~d} 8)$ poison damage and have the poisoned condition for 1 minute.

---

![img-17.jpeg](Quests%20from%20the%20Infinite%20Staircase_img-17.jpeg)

Map 2.4: Expanded Ziggurat
Immediately after a cocoon bursts, a mass of squirming, barbed tentacles (use the swarm of poisonous snakes stat block) emerges in the nearest unoccupied space. The oily limbs attack the nearest creature.

Treasure. Three of the chests contain gold masks of Zargon worth 50 gp each. Another contains a Spell Scroll of Evard's Black Tentacles.

## B67: Belly of the Beast

Smooth, wet tissue coats the walls of this cave. Cankerous lumps protrude from the flesh, dribbling caustic fluid into a sickly-hued pool of gastric juices. A rough stone pathway cuts through the bile.
Six dwarves with white hair and gray skin use severely corroded pickaxes to excavate an inflamed section of the wall. The chamber gurgles in agitation.

Six duergar loyal to Zargon work to expand this fleshy chamber. When the characters enter, two of the duergar are arguing over the quality of their tools. The duergar are friendly to characters who wear the masks of Zargon's cultists, allowing them to pass; otherwise, the duergar greet intruders with hostility.

Acid Pool. A hissing, 3-foot-deep pool of digestive acid fills the area around the stone path. A creature that enters the pool for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 22 (4d10) acid damage.

Bile Spouts. Four bile spouts, agitated by the duergar excavators, stud the walls. At initiative count 10 on each round (losing initiative ties), the spouts erupt with gouts of acid in a 60 -foot line that is 10 feet wide. Each creature in that area must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) acid damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

## B68: Spawning Chamber

A twenty-foot-deep pit takes up most of the floor of this rough-hewn chamber. A stone staircase curves down the wall of the pit, which holds three enormous stone vats brimming with differently colored liquids. Four cultists in dark purple robes pile armfuls of humanoid bones into each cistern.

Four cult fanatics deposit leftovers from sacrifices in area B69 into vats here in hopes of birthing Oozes to serve Zargon. The cultists are hostile toward intruders not garbed in their cult's attire.

---

If a cultist is slain, their companions rush to cast themselves into the vats, where they quickly dissolve and potentially spawn oozes. The cultists praise Zargon with their last breaths.
Ooze Vats. The three 10 -foot-wide vats each hold the essence of a different variety of Ooze. A creature that enters a vat for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 22 (4d10) acid damage. If a creature dies in a vat, a hostile ooze emerges from it 1 round later. The ooze has the same initiative count as the creature whose death spawned it. An ooze spawned this way is indifferent to the cultists but hostile to all other creatures.
The contents of the vats and the oozes they spawn are as follows:

Black Vat. A tarry, black substance bubbles within this vat, which can produce one black pudding. Clear Vat. This vat wobbles with a crystal-clear liquid that can produce up to two gelatinous cubes. Yellow Vat. The glistening, amber-hued jam within this vat can produce up to two ochre jellies.
Treasure. The four cultists each wear a gold mask of Zargon worth 50 gp .

## B69: Foul Ghapel

Sconces flicker in slimy alcoves within this ruined chapel, casting an eerie glow on five rows of clammy stone pews. Green mucus carpets the center aisle, leading to a bloodstained altar on a rocky precipice. Behind the altar, the chapel opens to a dark cavern. Two rusty cages are set into the chapel's north wall. An eye-shaped gong stands in the southeast corner. Six cultists sit in the pews. Before them is a priest in a horned mask adorned with eight chin tentacles.

Cultists present sacrifices to the Returner in this unholy temple. When the characters enter, Zekrikitch-a high priest of Zargon transformed by the Returner's slime-is addressing six cultists. Zekrikitch uses the mind flayer stat block, though he can also speak Common. Four of the tentacles under the high priest's mask are alive, writhing subtly as he speaks.

Zekrikitch telepathically probes the minds of any unexpected guests. If the characters attempt to fool the cultists using disguises or magic, the high priest plays along while telepathically warning his allies, who attack as one.
If the characters are defeated here or elsewhere on this level, the cultists chain one unlucky character to the altar and lock the remaining characters in the cages. The cultists then ring the gong.
Altar. Two sets of iron manacles (see the Player's Handbook) are bolted to the altar. A creature chained to the altar has the restrained condition.
Cages. The cages are 10 feet wide and 20 feet long. Both are empty. As an action, a character can pick a cage's lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check using thieves' tools or force open the rusty door with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check.
Gong. Ringing this eye-shaped gong signals to Zargon that a fresh sacrifice is ready for consumption. It takes 1 minute for the tyrant to slither from area B70 to the altar. If no sacrifice awaits it, Zargon unleashes its wrath on the chapel's occupants.
Slime Carpet. A 10 -foot-wide patch of green slime (see the Dungeon Master's Guide) intersects the pews. The slime doesn't harm Zargon or its cultists.
Tunnel. Directly behind the altar, the chamber drops steeply to a tunnel leading to area B70. The floor of the tunnel is 20 feet below the altar.
Treasure. Zekrikitch carries the keys to the cages and the altar's restraints. He and the six cultists each wear a gold mask of Zargon worth 50 gp .

---

## B70: LaIR OF ZARGON

A lake of slime fills this ruined chamber, whose walls climb 40 feet to a cavernous ceiling. Froth and scum line the lake's edge.
Shortly after the characters enter, a deep, guttural voice echoes in their minds. At first, its words are unintelligible, but slowly the gibberish gives way to a question: "What worlds have you destroyed?"
Give the party a moment to answer, then read:

A towering abomination rises from the slime. Three long tentacles tipped with bladelike barbs writhe from each of its shoulders, and six more slither below, propelling it forward. Beneath the two-foot-long black horn jutting from its hideous head, the creature's single bulging, red eye gazes down at you.

The creature is Zargon the Returner (see appendix B), the deathless aberration responsible for the fall of Cynidicea. Although Zargon is ageless, it is no god. A cunning evil of an age beyond memory, Zargon has discovered feigning godhood begets it a glut of sacrifices from those who crave its power.
If confronted by characters of 10 th level or lower, Zargon toys with the party. Mildly impressed by the characters' foolish resolve, the elder evil might offer to make them minions, lieutenants, or priests-but not before threatening to eat them. Zargon spares those who tremble before it, acknowledge it as a god, or make it an offering of at least 600 gp .
Zargon takes adventurers of 11th level or higher more seriously. Deprived of worthy challengers for centuries, the Returner dares the characters to claim its horn, as so many before them have tried.
In combat, Zargon fights to the death. The creature secretly delights at its own destruction, knowing it will regrow from its horn.
Lake of Slime. Between sacrifices, Zargon broods in its pool of slime. The pool is 30 feet deep, and visibility beneath the surface is limited to 10 feet.
Treasure. The treasures Zargon has gathered lie submerged in unlocked iron chests at the bottom of the lake. Its hoard contains the following rewards, which it never parts with willingly: 11,600 sp and 1,800 gp, a Cloak of Elvenkind, a Deck of Illusions, a +2 Shield, and a Scimitar of Speed.

## The Underground City

Beneath the ruins of Cynidicea lies an underground city in a vast cavern. By the time survivors fled here from their broken capital, the cultists of Zargon had already begun constructing the city and thriving in its darkness. In exchange for food, housing, and a modicum of protection, Zargon's priests demanded absolute obedience, which they received for a time.

The Cynidiceans silently endured for decades as Zargonites plucked living sacrifices from their ranks to appease their voracious overlord. However, decades of growing horrors have finally primed the people for rebellion.
The underground city is accessible via a trapdoor in area B57 of the ziggurat, but at your discretion, other entrances to it might exist.

## LifE in the Underground City

A deep freshwater lake lies in the center of the city, just beyond Zargon's polluting influence. The lake provides cool, clean water and fish-which it has aplenty-to the populace. The Cynidiceans also breed underground livestock-giant rodents, cave lizards, and the occasional carrion crawler.
Cynidiceans farm edible fungi in mildewy fields forested with mushrooms. Myconids roam these dense patches of overgrowth, which are more akin to fungal thickets than cultivated fields. These neighborly fungi help citizens transcend their dismal existence through communal melds in which they share dreams of a nobler era. Some Cynidiceans have grown to prefer these joyful melds over their daily lives, sinking into complacency. The priests of Zargon encourage this behavior-as long as the melds continue, the people are less likely to object to the cruelty the cult inflicts on them.

## Noteworthy Sites

The underground city occupies a vast cavern connected to catacombs of the old kingdom and the ziggurat above. Squat communal buildings in forgotten architectural styles line its forlorn streets, which are patrolled by Zargon's cultists.

## Entrance to the Ziggurat

This tunnel connects the underground city to the main entrance chamber of the ziggurat (area B57).

## Eye of Zargon

Outside the city lies a caustic pit known as the Eye of Zargon: a crater with a sickly glow reminiscent of Zargon's cycloptic eye. Zargonites regard the site as sacred and perform rituals to the Returner there. One legend states that to truly kill Zargon, its horn must be cast into the pit, but some fear this might be a deliberate misdirection spread by the cult.

## FACTION STRONGHOLDS

While most of the city lives in fear of Zargon and its devotees, three growing factions-the faithful of Cynidicea's old gods-plot to overthrow the Cult of Zargon and restore their former kingdom. Each faction does so alone, as mistrust and longstanding rivalries prevent them from uniting against the cult.
The factions maintain the following strongholds in the underground city:

---

![img-18.jpeg](Quests%20from%20the%20Infinite%20Staircase_img-18.jpeg)

Map 2.5: Underground City
Stronghold of Gorm. The Guardians of Gorm's headquarters is a pair of crooked towers mosaicked with brass tiles. The towers rise high above the complex's walled perimeter.
Stronghold of Madarua. Four guard towers pierce the air above the stronghold of the Warriors of Madarua like the spears of her fearless warriors. Day and night, the walled complex echoes with the clanging of steel from training combatants.
Stronghold of Usamigaras. The Mages of Usamigaras have no formal stronghold. Though outwardly welcoming, the wily mages gather in reinforced houses connected by a web of tunnels beneath the streets, allowing them to confuse and ambush invaders.

## Goblin Cliff Dwellings

On the lake's west shore, sheer cliffs rise to a plateau ruled by a gang of cave-dwelling goblinoid bandits. Seeking valuables, these goblinoids regularly descend the rickety scaffoldings and frayed rope ladders that cling to the cliffs, clashing with the Cynidiceans in the underground city. The goblinoid leader, a merciless hobgoblin warlord named Krod the Wretched, plans to conquer the underground city and loot its riches when the Cynidiceans reach the nadir of their sufferings.

## Island of Death

A small, stony island pockmarked with caves and tree-sized fungi rises from the lake. In the center of the island stands a circle of ancient menhirs predating the first-laid stones of Cynidicea. No one knows who built these monoliths or for what purpose, but they're rumored to be a source of necromantic power. When the Cynidiceans first fled here, they buried their dead on this island, along with priceless treasures-but the island slowly became infested with Undead, and soon those who voyaged there ceased to return.

## LOWER CAtacombs

An enormous stone slab seals the entrance to the lower catacombs. Locals warn against tampering with the barrier, which separates the underground city from terrible dangers lurking below.

## Temple of Zargon

Shaped like Zargon's menacing black horn, the Temple of Zargon houses the Returner's most loyal priests. Zargonites defend the structure at all hours. A sizable wing contains prison cells for sacrificial captives, embittered rebels, and anyone else foolish enough to offend the one-eyed tyrant or its cultists. The Returner's judgment awaits all who enter.

In an event foretold by the Books of Proghecy, a falling star lands in the Tegеред Mountains.
