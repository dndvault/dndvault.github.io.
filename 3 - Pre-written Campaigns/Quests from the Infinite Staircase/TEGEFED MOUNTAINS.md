# TEGEFED MOUNTAINS

## TEGEFED MOUNTAINS

This adventure takes place in the Tegefed Mountains region. The mountains are lofty and rugged, with snow on the upper peaks even in the warmer months. The surrounding hills and moors are dotted with sparse trees and flowers, and settlements are few and far between.
Map 3.1 depicts the stretch of the Tegefed Mountains where the adventure occurs. Any hex on the map that doesn't contain a river is difficult terrain for overland travel.

## RANDOM ENCOUNTERS

Random encounters can bring the region to life. An encounter might occur while the characters are traveling from one location to another or whenever the DM feels appropriate. To determine what the characters find, roll on the Random Tegefed Mountains Encounters table, rerolling duplicates.

## RANDOM TEGEFED MOUNTAINS ENCOUNTERS

d8 Encounter
1 Three griffons hunt the characters. A griffon egg in a nearby nest can fetch a price of up to 300 gp if sold to the right buyer.
2 Two displacer beasts quietly stalk the characters.
3 An ogre trains five boars to hunt wild animals. On noticing the characters, the ogre sets the pet boars loose on them instead.
4 Five bugbears ambush the party, demanding the characters give them 100 gp or face certain death. Each bugbear carries 3 gp in a coin pouch.
5 Ten giant bats swoop in and attack the characters. The bats focus their attacks on the character who makes the most noise.
6 The characters hear distant howls. Two dire wolves and five wolves descend on them 1 minute later.
7 A troll drags a large sack containing the carcass of a giant goat, seeking a good place to eat it. If the troll notices the characters, the troll drops the sack and attacks, deeming them a much tastier meal.
8 The characters encounter an injured hunter in the wilderness who calls out for help. The hunter is actually a hungry jackalwere bandit in human form. Five more jackalweres lie in ambush nearby.

## Death on the Moors

The adventure begins as the characters traverse the moors of the Tegefed Mountains. This journey leads through a beautiful tableau of rolling hills and snowy peaks-but the pleasant excursion is soon marred by a harrowing encounter.

## MEMORY WEB

As the characters travel through the region, read or paraphrase the following text:

The moorland of the Tegefed Mountains sprawls around you. Beneath lofty peaks, sparse trees and splashes of vivid flowers dot the green hills.
As you reach the top of yet another rise-this one blanketed with fragrant heather-the scenery is interrupted by a giant web that stretches out just a couple dozen feet from you. Four unmoving, white-robed figures lie enmeshed within it.

The mass of strands is a motionless memory web (see appendix B). The memory web attempts to catch the characters by surprise, launching itself at them to feed on their memories. If the characters ignore the bodies and continue on their way, the memory web follows stealthily and strikes a few minutes later.
When the memory web dies, its Memory Flood trait releases the messengers' memories it absorbed (see the "Flood of Memories" section).

## Shalfey's Emissaries

The robed figures are the corpses of four tower hands whom Shalfey sent to track down the star. The messengers' minds were drained by the memory web before death. As a result, the Speak with Dead spell and similar magic yield only confused, meaningless responses.
Bestiary for Derwyth. One of the corpses clutches a thin leather-bound book-an illustrated bestiary of creatures local to the mountains, which is worth 30 gp . The words "for Derwyth" are neatly written on its first page. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (History) check knows Derwyth is a druid who lives nearby in Cernant Valley (detailed later in this adventure). Shalfey's emissaries had planned to take the book to her as payment for information about the star.
Map of the Region. Another corpse clutches a hastily drawn map of the Tegefed Mountains, marked with the locations of Cernant Valley and the Tower of the Heavens (see map 3.1).

## Flood of Memories

When the memory web dies, a barrage of memories floods the characters' minds. Most of these fleeting images fade instantly, but the following scenes appear in quick succession and lodge themselves firmly in each character's memory.

## Memory 1: Initiation Day

The world around you blurs for a moment, and everything fades to black. When your senses return, you find yourself in a hazy, dreamlike scene.
Bookshelves surround you, and a large, shimmering sphere levitates on the other side of the room. In front of the sphere stands a bearded human sage, his arms covered with tattoos of constellations. "Remember it well," he says slowly and firmly. "Fair is the day-but fairer the jewels of the evening."

This memory takes place a few years ago. It depicts Shalfey initiating a group of tower hands into his private guard. Shalfey is teaching them the secret phrase used among his closest confidants. This phrase might come in handy when the characters meet Hadley, who runs the ferry at the Tower of the Heavens (detailed later in this adventure).

## Memory 2: The Star Foretold

The scene shifts. The sage has aged by several years. Distraught, he paces in a starlit observatory.
"The book speaks of a star falling to earth-a black rock, seemingly worthless but seared by the heavens," he explains. "Only it can help us. We must find it, and soon, or evil will seize the power of prophecy."

Four days ago, Shalfey recounted his findings from the final page of the Books of Prophecy.

## Memory 3: Shalfey's Orders

Another memory shifts into your mind. The same old man gazes at you with desperate intensity. "Go, seek Derwyth, a fellow star-watcher," he urges. "Make haste to her home in Cernant Valley."

He places a thin leather book in your hands, which are not your own. "Give her this bestiary as payment. When the star falls, only she can tell you where it landed. I implore you, do not return without the star."

Three days ago, Shalfey tasked his tower hands with seeking out Derwyth. They died along the way.

---

## Falling Star

After the characters have a moment to process the memories they've received, they witness the foretold falling star. Read or paraphrase the following text:

Your surroundings momentarily brighten as a brilliant light streaks across the heavens and plummets to the earth. As the falling star lands in the mountains ahead, a distant rumble accompanies the impact, causing flocks of birds to scatter from the hills.

The falling star's glittering trail briefly lingers in the air. Though the characters can't determine exactly where the star landed, they can tell from the map that it fell near Cernant Valley, where Shalfey's emissaries were headed. If the characters didn't find the map, the memory flood has given them the equivalent knowledge of the region.

## Next Steps

The characters now know the locations of two points of interest: the Tower of the Heavens and Cernant Valley. Where they choose to go next is up to them. Either way, they receive an unwelcome visit in the night (see the following section).

## Piyarz's Shadow

Shalfey's messengers were followed by an assassin named Sion-a shadowy mage molded by darkness. With them dead, Sion stalks the characters instead, waiting for the cover of night to strike.

## Stalked by a Shadow

When Piyarz seized the Tower of the Heavens in his coup, he interrogated Shalfey's scribes to discern where the elder sage sent his tower hands. Eventually the ruthless sage discovered the reason for the expedition: recovering a fallen star to acquire new Books of Prophecy. Piyarz then killed the scribes, leaving no allies of Shalfey alive in the tower.
Coveting the power of prophecy for himself, Piyarz dispatched Sion, his most trusted and terrible servant, in pursuit of Shalfey's expedition.

## Night Ambush

Sion (see appendix B) ambushes the characters at night. If the characters decided to rest after facing the memory web, Sion interrupts their repose.
Sion is accompanied by a hound and an oversized raven, both made of pure shadow (both creatures use the shadow stat block, but the raven has a flying speed of 40 feet). When a companion drops to 0 hit points, it vanishes in a cloud of shadow. The companions also vanish when Sion dies.
![img-21.jpeg](Quests%20from%20the%20Infinite%20Staircase_img-21.jpeg)

Sion attempts to isolate a character-especially anyone taking watch-and threaten them into giving him information about the fallen star for his employer, whom he refuses to name. Sion is most interested in what knowledge the characters gleaned from the slain memory web. If the characters took either the bestiary or the map from the emissaries' corpses, Sion demands those as well. Otherwise, he has those items on his person.
When he's satisfied with the characters' answers or deems the party uncooperative, Sion attacks. He and his sinister pets fight to the death, unflinchingly loyal to Piyarz.

---

## Cernant Valley

Shalfey instructed his emissaries to visit Derwyth, an elf druid who lives near the Tegefed Mountains. According to the Books of Prophecy, she would know precisely where to find the star once it fell.
Derwyth lives in Cernant Valley-a forested basin at the foot of the Tegefed Mountains-along with many animals, most of which are small woodland creatures. These animals act as Derwyth's eyes and ears, quickly bringing her news of events in the wood, particularly the arrival and actions of strangers. The creatures also carry messages to more powerful Beasts in the valley that sometimes come to Derwyth's aid.

## Arrival at Cernant Valley

When the party enters Cernant Valley, read or paraphrase the following text:

Two giant eagles soar down to meet you, landing in nearby trees that creak gently beneath the eagles' weight. "Welcome, ground-walkers," squawks one of the eagles. The other continues: "This is the home of Derwyth. If you come in peace, follow us-if not, leave now."

Avri and Ivo, two giant eagles who speak Common, welcome the characters to Derwyth's wood. The eagles are loyal to Derwyth and friendly to those who regard her home with respect. They spend their days soaring over the valley and watching for intruders.
The eagles offer to lead the characters to Derwyth's homestead. If the characters decline or offend Avri and Ivo, the eagles tell them to leave. If combat ensues, three elk join the fray on initiative count 20 of the third round (losing initiative ties); the elk aid the eagles however they can. Attacking the eagles sours Derwyth's opinion of the characters, who fail her test (see the "Derwyth's Test" section later in this adventure).

## Going It Alone

If the characters refuse the eagles' guidance, they must find their own way to Derwyth's homestead. The character leading the party must make a DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) check to navigate the valley's tangled thickets. On a successful check, the characters reach the homestead without issue. On a failed check, they eventually arrive at the homestead, but the journey is exhaustingly circuitous; each character must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 level of exhaustion.

## Derwyth's Homestead Features

Derwyth and many of her animal companions dwell in a small collection of thatch-roofed buildings at the heart of Cernant Valley. The homestead has the following features:
Buildings. The buildings have thick walls of compacted earth and grass, and the gabled thatch roofs are supported by beams of riven oak. The ceilings are 10 feet tall. There are no windows.
Doors. The doors are made of thick oak planks. As an action, a character can force open a locked door with a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check or pick the lock with a successful DC 12 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check using thieves' tools. Derwyth carries a key to each locked door. Lighting. Rooms are brightly lit by baskets of fireflies hanging from the roof beams.

## Derwyth's Homestead Locations

The following locations are keyed to map 3.2. The "Trial of Trust" section later in this chapter explains how events might unfold in the homestead.

## H1: Yard

Whether led by the eagles or by forging a path through the thicket, the characters likely enter the homestead via the yard. When they arrive, read or paraphrase the following text:

This serene homestead is perfectly quiet, save for a babbling brook and the gentle chirping of birds. A rustic wooden fence encloses three simple buildings with walls of compacted earth and grass. Birch trees stand tall in the center of the yard.

If Avri and Ivo are present, the eagles tell the characters Derwyth is currently out gathering food, but she should be back soon; the characters can wait in the yard until then. After advising the characters to behave themselves, the eagles take flight.
Derwyth. In truth, Derwyth is disguised as a birch tree in the center of the yard, watching how the characters behave. The "Trial of Trust" section later in this chapter details how the druid observes and interacts with the characters.
Derwyth is a neutral good, elf druid who has darkvision out to 60 feet, speaks Common and Elvish, and has the following additional trait:
Tree Shape (2/Day). Over the course of 1 minute, Derwyth can magically transform into a Huge or smaller tree and remain in that form for 24 hours or until she ends this transformation early (no action required). Her equipment melds into her new form. While in this form, her Armor Class is 16, she has the incapacitated condition, and she can't move or speak.

---

## H2: Antechamber

This room's south door is locked. If the characters enter, read or paraphrase the following text:

Old cloaks and walking sticks hang from hooks on the wall of this entry room. A pair of muddy boots lie on the floor, and a dusty broom stands in the far corner.

The items here all belong to Derwyth. There are nine walking sticks, each lovingly carved from a different kind of wood.

## H3: Hall

Six wooden posts support the roof of this simple hall. Sturdy benches of hardened clay line the walls, and a long hearth spans the center of the earthen floor. An ornate harp hangs from a hook on one of the posts.

Derwyth entertains guests in this dining hall.
Treasure. The harp is made of plum wood, inlaid with fine mithral wire, and worth 300 gp .

## H4: Derwyth's Room

This room's door is locked. If the characters enter, read or paraphrase the following text:

This small, plain chamber contains a round carpet and a long chest. An alcove in the far wall displays a small statue of a leaping stag.

This is Derwyth's private resting chamber.
Treasure. The stag statue in the alcove is made of fine wood and worth 160 gp . The chest is unlocked; it contains a bag of 50 gp ; three Potions of Healing in ceramic flagons; gardening implements; and worn robes, cloaks, tunics, boots, and sandals.

## H5: Library and Workshop

This room's south door is locked. If the characters enter, read or paraphrase the following text:

Wooden shelves along the north wall of this room hold a jumble of books and scrolls, many of which have tumbled to the floor. The table in the center of the room bears scrolls with complex astrological notes in addition to quills, ink, and other stationery.

Derwyth stores her texts in this study. In all, there are eighty-four books and over two hundred scrolls-a comprehensive library of the druid's fields of interest: mainly animals, plants, and astronomy.
![img-22.jpeg](Quests%20from%20the%20Infinite%20Staircase_img-22.jpeg)

Map 3.2: Derwyth's Homestead
The scrolls on the table include Derwyth's notes concerning the fallen star. Though the party can easily recognize these notes, only someone versed in astronomy-such as Derwyth, Shalfey, or a character proficient with navigator's tools-can use them to determine the landing point of the star, a process that takes 2 hours.

## H6: Goat Barn

This barn smells strongly of livestock. Here, three horse-sized goats quietly munch on hay. A stool sits on the straw-covered floor near some large milking pails and vessels for making cheese.

Three giant goats live here. If it's clear Derwyth is in danger, the goats come to her aid, but they're otherwise friendly toward strangers and usually don't mind being milked.
A character can attempt to milk a goat by making a DC 10 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. On a successful check, the goat produces one bucket's worth of milk. On a failed check, the goat delivers a swift, agitated kick, and the milker takes 2 (1d4) bludgeoning damage and has the prone condition.

---

![img-23.jpeg](Quests%20from%20the%20Infinite%20Staircase_img-23.jpeg)

## H7: Food Storage

A central post supports the conical roof of this circular hut. Piled around the walls are dozens of sacks, casks, boxes, and jars. A saber-toothed tiger lounges on one of the casks.

These containers hold enough cheese, dried meat, flour, fruits, nuts, vegetables, and wine to sustain one person for half a year.
Derwyth's saber-toothed tiger lazes here during the druid's test (see the "Trial of Trust" section). The tiger is initially indifferent toward the party and doesn't stop characters from stealing food from the hut; however, it leaps to Derwyth's aid if the druid is in danger.
If the characters do nothing to anger the tiger, they can safely pet it with a DC 10 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. On a successful check, the tiger rolls onto its back and chuffs happily. On a failed check, the tiger growls threateningly, then attacks if pestered further.

## Trial of Trust

Derwyth received advance notice of the characters' arrival from woodland creatures in Cernant Valley. She has used her Tree Shape trait to disguise herself as a tree in the yard (area H1), from where she discreetly observes the party.

## Derwyth's Test

Derwyth remains in tree form for 10 minutes after the characters arrive. If the characters don't break her trust by harming her giant eagle friends, entering locked rooms, harming her animals, or stealing her possessions, they pass her test. Otherwise, they fail. At the end of this time, Derwyth reveals herself. When Derwyth abandons her disguise, read:

One of the birch trees in the yard begins to twist and creak, shrinking and uprooting itself. In seconds, an elf woman with white hair stands where the tree once did. She wears a brown cloak clasped with a sunflower brooch and sports a sturdy, wooden prosthetic leg.

Derwyth's attitude toward the characters depends on whether they passed or failed her test.

---

Passing Derwyth's Test. If the characters passed Derwyth's test, she commends their behavior and invites them into her dining hall (area H3), where she offers them bowls of vegetables, fruits, and nuts, as well as wooden vessels of water or wine. Until she's fully convinced of the characters' intentions, however, Derwyth actively discourages characters from snooping around her homestead.
During their meal, Derwyth asks the characters their business and listens intently. Though she has never met Shalfey, she knows of the elder sage and thinks well of him. If the characters detail their memories from the memory web, Derwyth realizes Shalfey's messengers intended for her to determine the star's landing place. She tells the characters she saw the star fall and can approximate its point of impact (see the "Derwyth's Star Calculations" section).
Failing Derwyth's Test. If the characters failed Derwyth's test or they otherwise break her trust, she orders them to leave. A character who offers an earnest apology can convince Derwyth to let them stay with a successful DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check. If the characters don't make amends and refuse to leave the homestead, Derwyth attacks, calling the saber-toothed tiger in area $\mathrm{H7}$ and the three giant goats in area H6 to back her up. If Derwyth is defeated, news of the battle quickly spreads to Beasts throughout Cernant Valley, who regard the characters with hostility.

## Derwyth's Star Calculations

Once Derwyth trusts the characters, she offers to calculate where the star landed in exchange for 200 gp, but she gladly accepts the bestiary carried by Shalfey's emissaries in lieu of payment. If the characters refuse to compensate Derwyth, she responds as outlined in the "Failing Derwyth's Test" section.
Once paid, Derwyth retires to her library (area H5) to perform her calculations. If the characters want to be useful in the meantime, Derwyth suggests they milk the goats in the barn (see area H6).
What Derwyth Knows. After 2 hours, Derwyth finishes her calculations. She tells the characters the shooting star fell in Therno Pass, a small region of the Tegefed Mountains inhabited by Aberrations called derro. All she knows about this group of derro is that they live underground, shun the light of day, and are feared for their ruthless attacks on nearby settlements. Derwyth marks the star's landing point on the characters' map; it corresponds with the location of the derro lair on map 3.1.
Bidding Farewell. After sharing this information, Derwyth offers the characters the opportunity to rest in her homestead before the party departs. If the characters made a good impression on her, she also gives them the three Potions of Healing from the chest in her room. The giant eagles Avri and Ivo then escort the characters out of Cernant Valley.

## Derro LaIR

A merciless faction of derro raiders has established a lair about a dozen miles from Therno Lake. From this outpost, the raiders pillage the surrounding countryside, frequently accosting hunters and traveling merchants. These forays are inspired not only by the raiders' greed but also by their sinister habit of dragging their victims' corpses back to the outpost to conscript them as zombie guards and workers.
When the star fell, it crashed into this outpost. The impact collapsed several tunnels, cutting the derro off from both the surface and the Underdark below. The collapse also destroyed the derro's idol of their god, Diirinka. Seeing this destruction as an omen from Diirinka, the derro dug westward to free themselves from the cave-in and snatched the star from the crater where it landed.
The derro believe the star is an object of immense power. Determined to take the star to the Underdark to gain leverage and status, the derro have been digging a new path to the subterranean depths.

## Point of Impact

If the characters discovered the location of the fallen star from Derwyth's calculations, they have no trouble traveling directly to the point of impact. Likewise, if the characters already met the hunters of Therno Lake (detailed later in this adventure), those hunters might have directed them to the derro lair.
If the characters failed to secure such information, they can find the star's point of impact by journeying to southern Therno Pass and succeeding on a DC 20 Wisdom (Survival) check. Characters who make this check from a suitably high vantage point, such as a mountain peak, have advantage on the check.

## Impact Crater

The star created a crater on the side of the pass, directly above the derro outpost. When the characters arrive, read or paraphrase the following text:

The crater is nearly fifty feet across and half as deep. Singed trees, their trunks bent by the star's impact and their leaves blown off entirely, lean away from the crater. Rocks litter the hillside in all directions, and much of the crater is full of rubble. A shallow ditch, recently excavated, lies at the bottom of the basin.

The derro dug this 10 -foot-deep ditch to get to the star. Only a broken pickaxe lies at the bottom of the ditch; the star is long gone.
Characters who survey the surrounding area easily notice two openings lower on the mountainside: a north-facing entrance of worked stone (to area D1) and a west-facing natural cave (to area D2).

---

## Derro Lair Features

The derro lair has the following features:
Ceilings. The lair's rough-hewn chambers have low, 6 -foot ceilings. The natural caverns that connect the chambers have ceilings as tall as the caves are wide.
Doors. Unless specified otherwise, doors are made of sturdy planks and unlocked.
Lighting. The derro lair isn't illuminated. The derro rely on darkvision to see. Area descriptions assume the characters have a light source or other means of seeing in the dark.
Loose Rubble. Much of the central lair is blocked by rubble that would require days to clear, but some areas have loose rubble that can be cleared more quickly. A character who takes 1 minute to clear loose rubble and succeeds on a DC 18 Strength (Athletics) check removes a 5 -foot cube of rubble.

## Derro Lair Locations

The following locations are keyed to map 3.3.

## Dl: Guardroom

The far wall of this room and much of the ceiling have collapsed. The corpses of five small dwarf-like creatures with gray skin and wild, white hair sprawl on the floor, partially buried under fallen rock.

This guardroom was once the sole entrance to the derro lair. When the star struck, collapsing masonry killed this chamber's occupants and cut off the room from the rest of the lair. Preoccupied with the fallen star, the surviving derro haven't retrieved their dead cohorts.
Treasure. Characters can pull the derro corpses from the rubble with ease. The corpses carry a total of 60 gp between them.

## D2: Outer Cave

Water flows from two pools on the east edge of this cave, combining into a narrow stream that trickles out the entrance.

Five derro raiders and one derro apprentice (see appendix B for both stat blocks) hide behind the pillars in this room. The derro entered the cave through the southeast pool and are dripping wet. They're uninterested in negotiation and ambush any who enter their cavern. A character who examines the room and succeeds on a DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check notices wet footprints along the cavern floor before the derro attack.

Pools. Both pools are 8 feet deep at their deepest point. A short underwater tunnel in the southeast pool connects this area to the inner cave (area D3).
Treasure. The derro apprentice carries a decorative silver dagger with an ivory handle, worth 50 gp , along with a belt pouch containing 20 gp .

## D3: Inner Cave

A pool lies at the north end of this natural cavern. On the cavern's east wall, a rough-hewn tunnel opens five feet above ground level. Sounds of digging emanate from the tunnel. Beneath the opening is a large mound of loose soil and rocks.

When the star fell, it collapsed the lair's exits to the surface and the Underdark. The trapped derro dug a tunnel to this cavern from the temple (area D4), reconnecting the temple to the outside world.
Shortly after the party arrives, a zombie emerges from the east tunnel and empties a basket of small rocks onto the pile below. The zombie is indifferent toward the characters and ignores them unless they try to get its attention, at which point it attacks.

## D4: Temple

The walls of this rough-hewn chamber have been painted with broad, jagged lines of black and white. On the west side of the room, fragments of a black marble statue lie shattered on the floor. In the northeast corner of the room, four derro use hammers to clear rubble from a blocked passage. Four zombies accompany them, clawing mindlessly at the rubble.

Four derro raiders (see appendix B) and four zombies attempt to clear a collapsed passage. They hope to eventually reach a tunnel leading down to the Underdark (see area D10) blocked by debris.
The derro attack intruders on sight, eager to rob them. The zombies obey the derro's commands.
Shattered Idol. The fragments of black marble are the remnants of an idol to Diirinka, the derro's cruel patron god. The star's impact caused the idol to topple and shatter. The fragments are worthless.

## D5: Collapsed Tunnel

A short distance down the corridor, fallen masonry completely blocks the path. Partially buried under the rocks lie several derro corpses-alongside a few longdead hunters with decaying flesh.

---

![img-24.jpeg](Quests%20from%20the%20Infinite%20Staircase_img-24.jpeg)

Man 33: Derno LaIR
These derro, along with their zombie thralls, were caught in a cave-in while trying to dig a tunnel back to the Underdark. The collapse killed the derro and laid the zombified hunters to rest.

## D6: Stolen Goods

A few crates are scattered around this room, and two immense golden antlers hang from the far wall. Five derro cluster around an open chest in the center of the room, examining its contents. Two slack-jawed zombies stand nearby, watching for intruders.

Three derro raiders and two derro apprentices (see appendix B for both stat blocks) gather around a chest in the middle of this room. They're guarded by two zombies. The derro and their Undead thralls attack intruders on sight.
Fallen Star. Inside the chest rests the fallen star, laid reverently on a rich, red cloak. The 10 -pound star is roughly spherical and about the size of a grapefruit. It's made of a black, glass-like material with a burnt appearance. The star is nonmagical but extremely resilient; it can't be destroyed by anything short of a Disintegrate spell.

Treasure. One derro apprentice wears a pair of gold armbands worth 50 gp each, and the other apprentice has a Potion of Diminution hanging from their belt. The golden antlers are worth 300 gp each; they were stolen from the hunters of Therno Lake. The other crates in this room contain additional goods stolen from Therno Lake: casks of ale, dishware, fur coats, spears, and carved wooden trinkets.

## D7: OVERSEER'S ROOM

The walls and ceiling of this devastated room have mostly collapsed, and falling rock has smashed all the furniture except a sturdy chest in the south corner. Vials of blood, pouches of bones, and other macabre paraphernalia lie scattered around the room. An eerie, persistent scratching sound comes from behind the fallen masonry blocking the far end of the room.

This was the private room of the faction's original overseer. The overseer was killed elsewhere in the lair by a cave-in (see area D8). In life, the overseer used this room to transform corpses-primarily those of hunters from Therno Lake-into zombies.

---

A character who examines the room's contents and succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence (Arcana) check recognizes the vials of blood and pouches of bone as components used in foul necromantic rituals.
Five zombies are trapped in a small pocket of loose rubble (see the "Derro Lair Features" section). If the characters clear the rubble, the freed zombies attack their liberators.
Treasure. A locked iron chest in this room contains 900 gp . The key is on the overseer's corpse in area D8. Alternatively, as an action a character can pick the lock with a successful DC 18 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check using thieves' tools.

## D8: Ruins of the Great Hall

This area is blocked off by loose rubble (see the "Derro Lair Features" section). If the characters clear the rubble, read or paraphrase the following:

The air in these ruins is thick with the smell of death. Shattered furniture, rubble, and the corpses of derro and hunters litter the floor. A pair of stylish leather boots protrude from a mound of fallen rock.

The corpses of fifteen derro and twelve Humanoid hunters lie on the floor, all casualties of the cave-in. More bodies are buried beneath the rocks.
The boots-and the pair of feet in them-belong to the corpse of the outpost's overseer. Pulling the corpse from the rubble dislodges some rocks in the process. Each creature within 10 feet of the corpse must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, taking 11 (2d10) bludgeoning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.
![img-25.jpeg](Quests%20from%20the%20Infinite%20Staircase_img-25.jpeg)

Treasure. The overseer's corpse has a Wand of Magic Detection in one hand and, in a pocket, the key to the locked chest in area D7. The corpse also wears a gold ring worth 50 gp . The boots, though stylish, are worth no more than ordinary boots.

## D9: Hungry Lamia

This area is blocked off by loose rubble (see the "Derro Lair Features" section). If the characters clear the rubble, read or paraphrase the following:

The walls of this room are painted pale green. A small table by the north wall bears a crystal decanter of wine. On a pile of quilted cushions in the corner sits a creature whose head, arms, and torso resemble those of a human woman but whose lower half is that of a four-legged lion. "Visitors!" she says over the rumble of her stomach. "Please, have you any fresh meat?"

A lamia sits in this room. Formerly an ally of the derro, she used her magic to help the raiders learn Therno Lake's defenses. Secretly, many derro feared the lamia, and they were relieved when the cave-in trapped her here.
The lamia hasn't eaten in days. If the characters give her a generous portion of fresh meat-such as a recently slain derro-she devours it, then lies down for a nap, paying them no further attention. Rations, zombies, and similarly unappetizing fare anger the lamia. If the characters proffer unsuitable meat or none at all, she attacks them ravenously.
Poison Decanter. The crystal decanter contains one glass's worth of wine, into which the lamia secretly mixed a dose of potent poison. A creature that drinks the wine must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 6 (1d12) poison damage and has the poisoned condition for 24 hours. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage only.
A small silver key rests at the bottom of the decanter, obscured by the wine until the decanter is emptied. This key opens a jewelry box beneath the lamia's cushions (see the following section).
Treasure. A locked silver jewelry box is hidden beneath the cushions. As an action, a character can pick the lock with a successful DC 18 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check using thieves' tools. The jewelry box itself is worth 20 gp , and it contains four red garnets worth 50 gp each.

## D10. Eastern Tunnel

This collapsed tunnel, blocked by rubble, eventually leads to a derro stronghold in the Underdark. The stronghold and its contents are beyond the scope of this story but could inspire an additional adventure if, by some means, the party reaches this tunnel.

## Therno Lake

Ever since the derro established an outpost in the southern part of Therno Pass, they have preyed cruelly on the region's local creatures and Humanoid inhabitants. In a bid to protect themselves, a band of hunters has allied with a family of intelligent giant beavers. These beavers have constructed a dam across the northern stretch of the pass, forming a lake behind the dam.
The hunters and giant beavers are wary of trespassers, and thanks to their alliance, the lakeside community has recently suffered fewer losses from the ongoing derro attacks. Curiously, the derro drag away the corpses of hunters they kill in these raids. The hunters of Therno Lake don't know it, but the derro have been animating these corpses as zombies to help guard their outpost.

## Giant Beavers

Therno Lake is home to a family of intelligent giant beavers. These beavers use the giant weasel stat block with the following changes.

- They have a swimming speed of 40 feet.
- They understand Common but can't speak it.


## Therno Lake Locations

The following locations are keyed to map 3.4.

## L1: Beaver Dam

A wide dam of mud, logs, and branches blocks this section of the pass, creating a lake to the north. A trickle from the dam feeds a stream that winds south.

Three giant beavers (see the "Giant Beavers" section) swim underwater on the north side of the dam. If the characters approach from the south, the giant beavers poke their heads above the barrier for a moment, then begin slapping their tails on the water. This calls the hunters in area L2, who arrive at the dam after 1 minute.
Beaver Dam. The dam is sturdy and made of wet wood. It has Armor Class 14, 100 hit points, immunity to poison and psychic damage, and resistance to fire damage. If reduced to 0 hit points, the dam is breached.
If the dam is breached, each creature in the lake is swept southward 300 feet by the ensuing deluge, though the beaver lodge (area L3) isn't washed away. Additionally, water blasts south from the dam in a 100 -foot-wide, 300 -foot-long line. Each

Map 3.4: TherNo Lake
creature in that area must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. Creatures with a swimming speed have advantage on this saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes $18(4 \mathrm{~d} 8)$ bludgeoning damage from the crashing waves, has the prone condition, and is swept southward 300 feet from the dam. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage only.

## L2: LAKE

Where a mountain spur divides two branches of the valley, an elongated, V-shaped lake extends across the pass, contained by a dam to the south. Three small hunting boats glide around the lake in wide circles. The humanoids aboard peer intently into the water with spears at the ready.

Six hunters (scouts) are fishing in the lake, two per hunting boat. One is their community's leader, a redhaired human woman named Aspen.
Speaking with the Hunters. Aspen and the other hunters are neutral good. While the hunters are wary of outsiders, if the characters show they mean no harm, the hunters agree to parley. Aspen shares the following information:

- The hunters witnessed the star fall, but they aren't sure exactly where it landed.
- They know the star fell south of Therno Lake, in the direction where the derro raiders typically come from.
- They know the location of the derro lair, and they can point the characters to it.
Quest to the Derro Lair. If Aspen trusts the party, she tasks them with a special quest. The derro have been dragging hunter corpses to their lair for an unknown purpose. Recently, the derro also pillaged one of the hunters' most precious trophies: a pair of large golden antlers. (The antlers can be found in area D6 of the derro lair, which is detailed earlier in this adventure.)
If the characters learn what the derro do with the corpses and return the golden antlers to Therno Lake, Aspen gives the characters her pouch of pearls (see the "Treasure" section below).
Treasure. A pouch around Aspen's neck contains a string of pearls worth 120 gp total.


## L3: Beavers' Lodge

A large mound of densely woven branches and twigs, about thirty feet across, rises from the lake.

An underwater entrance to this beaver lodge leads to an air pocket above water level. Inside, two friendly giant beavers (see the "Giant Beavers" section) tend to five baby beavers. A pile of fish bones sits on one side of the room.
Treasure. If the characters offer the beavers food, one of the beavers digs through the fish bones and retrieves a random trinket (roll on the Trinkets table in the Player's Handbook) as a token of appreciation for the party.

## L4: Hunters' CAMP

Five huts made from rock, tanned hides, and sticks cluster together on a spur of land jutting into the lake. Between the huts are rows of animal skins stretched over wooden frames.

The hunters of Therno Lake live in this camp. Eight hunters (scouts) and twenty commoners, all in thick leather clothes, make up the community. They are wary of outsiders but otherwise indifferent toward the characters.
Treasure. The only items of significant value in the camp are animal skins. The many wolf, bear, and fox pelts have a total value of 90 gp and a combined weight of 720 pounds.

## Tower of the Heavens

The Tower of the Heavens is renowned as a seat of learning for astronomers-and as a source of prophecy for visitors who can afford it. For more on the tower, see this adventure's background.
For centuries, each elder sage has passed down the Books of Prophecy to that sage's chosen successor. Piyarz was Shalfey's pupil, and according to tradition, he would assume the title of elder sage on Shalfey's death. However, Piyarz grew impatient. When Shalfey's tower hands left in search of the star, Piyarz tried to seize the title-but Shalfey sealed himself in his sanctum (areas T19-T22). Shalfey threatened to destroy the Books of Prophecy if anyone attempts to break into his sanctum, so Piyarz decided to starve him out instead.

## OCCUPANTS OF THE TOWER

The current occupants of the tower are divided into the following four factions.

## Griswill Garrison

The Griswill Garrison is a group of gnome mercenaries paid to serve Shalfey. Believing the elder sage dead, the gnomes now follow Piyarz's orders.

## Hostel Staff

Several commoners run a hostel on a smaller island bordering the tower. Piyarz told them Shalfey was dead and instructed them to keep the hostel up and running.

## Sage Pupils and Tower Hands

Cipolla, Porro, and Lurg were Shalfey's pupils until they joined Piyarz's attempt to seize power. Evil and opportunistic, the four sages staged a coup with the help of tower hands they recruited to their cause.
Each tower sage has magical tattoos on their arms: glowing constellations that magically update to reflect that sage's hierarchy within the tower's prophetic order. Though Piyarz claims to be the new elder sage, Shalfey still lives, so the tattoos on Piyarz's arms haven't changed. Piyarz covers his arms when he's around the Griswill Garrison and the hostel staff, worried they'll discover his secret.

## Shalfey and Hadley

Shalfey held the titles of elder sage and keeper of the books until Piyarz's coup. Though Piyarz now falsely claims these titles and Shalfey is confined to his sanctum, Shalfey remains the true head of the tower. His only surviving confidant is Hadley, who runs the tower's ferry. Hadley knows Shalfey still lives; he feigns loyalty to Piyarz while subtly searching for allies among the ferry's passengers. Hadley is unsure if he can trust the Griswills and hasn't told them Shalfey is alive.

## Reaching the Tower

The Tower of the Heavens sits on a pair of islets in the middle of a wide, fast-flowing river. The waters around the islets are swirling and treacherous. Only Hadley, whose hut sits on the south riverbank, knows the waters well enough to guide boats safely between the mainland and the smaller island's jetty. Characters who attempt to sail or swim to the islands are swept downstream by the current and wash up on the riverbank far from their destination.
When the characters arrive, read or paraphrase the following text:

On the south bank of the river stands a simple hut with a thatched roof. A small boat is tied up at a nearby jetty. Beyond the hut, rushing waters surround two islands linked to each other by a bridge. The smaller island has a dock and a modest outpost, and the larger boasts a grand stone tower.
As you approach the hut, a human man in a green tunic emerges from the hut and waves at you. "Fair is the day," he says cautiously.

## Hadley's Confidences

Hadley (neutral good, human commoner) greets the characters with the first part of a secret phrase used by Shalfey and his allies. Hadley hopes the characters will reply, "but fairer the jewels of the evening." This phrase was part of the visions imparted by the memory web (see the "Flood of Memories" section earlier in this adventure), though the characters might not recognize its significance. A character who succeeds on a DC 14 Wisdom (Insight) check gets the sense Hadley is looking for a specific reply.
If the party doesn't respond with the other half of the phrase, Hadley offers to take them to the island. During the crossing, he uses the opening phrase twice more. If the characters still fail to offer the proper response, Hadley takes them to the outpost (area T1) without further conversation.
Hadley Confides in the Party. If the characters give the appropriate response to the secret phrase, Hadley trusts them and assumes they're allies of Shalfey. Read or paraphrase the following text as Hadley ferries the characters to the island:

A relieved grin breaks across Hadley's face. "I had a feeling you were more than you appeared." He lowers his voice and speaks hastily. "They say Shalfey is dead and Piyarz is now the elder sage. But I know that isn't true, and now I know I can confide in you. How did you learn Shalfey's passphrase?"

---

Hadley believes whatever tale the characters tell him. If they admit they've never met Shalfey, Hadley is disappointed but decides the characters are his best shot at rescuing the elder sage.
What Hadley Knows. If the characters respond to Hadley's secret phrase, he shares the following information with them:
What's Going On? Shalfey is the elder sage of the Tower of the Heavens. Piyarz, his would-be successor, declared Shalfey dead a few days ago. But yesterday, Hadley heard the elder sage's desperate voice in his mind, speaking only the passphrase Hadley and the characters exchanged. Hadley believes the elder sage is still alive somewhere in the tower.
What Happened to Shalfey? Piyarz has long sought Shalfey's title, and Hadley fears foul play. The tower hands closest to Shalfey left the tower on a secret mission the day before his supposed death, leaving the elder sage defenseless.
What Can Be Done? Hadley asks the characters to discover what's going on in the tower and rescue Shalfey. He suggests they pose as visitors requesting prophecies and infiltrate the tower through the Questioner's Hall.

Moments after Hadley recounts this information, the ferry arrives at the outpost (area T1). Hadley doesn't accompany the characters further.

## Tower of the Heavens Features

Unless otherwise specified, the Tower of the Heavens has the following features:
Ceilings. Tower rooms have 15 -foot-high ceilings. Doors. Doors are made of thick oak planks and bound with iron. As an action, a character can force open a locked door with a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check or pick the lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check using thieves' tools.
Walls. The exterior walls of the tower and its hostel are slick stone. Climbing these walls is difficult without climbing gear or magic, requiring a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check. The hostel has windows, but the tower's only windows are the glass panes over its domed observatory.
Lighting. The tower uses wall-mounted torches lit with Continual Flame spells, while the hostel uses ordinary lamps. The hostel's rooms are brightly lit during the day and dark at night, while the tower's rooms are always brightly lit.

---

## Tower of the Heavens Locations

The following locations are keyed to map 3.5.

## T1: Outpost

This outpost watches the bridge between the hostel and the tower. A jetty lies just north of the outpost.
When the characters arrive at the outpost, read or paraphrase the following text:

A drab building of gray stone overlooks the steps leading up from the jetty. Three gnomes wearing heavy armor peek out from one of the building's tall, narrow windows. They wave as you approach.

Three members of the Griswill Garrison (lawful neutral, gnome guards) stand watch in this outpost at all hours. Unless treated poorly, the cheery gnomes are friendly toward the characters, asking what brings them to the tower. It's the gnomes' job to greet visitors, inquire about their business, and keep an eye out for any clearly hostile intruders.

## T2: Hostel

Visitors stay in this small hostel while they wait to be called for their answering ceremony, the ritual through which fortunes are told. Lodging costs 1 gp per person per night; meals and drinks aren't included. Trouble in the hostel attracts the attention of the guards in the outpost (area T1).
The hostel's proprietor is a human woman named Berta. Four peppy humans in leather aprons help her carry supplies, cook, and clean. Berta and her assistants use the commoner stat block. They're friendly and welcoming, and they know nothing of the attempted coup. They believe Shalfey died of natural causes and regard Piyarz as the legitimate keeper of the books unless proven otherwise.
Hostel Areas. The hostel has the following areas:
T2a: Courtyard. Stairs from the jetty lead up to this open-air courtyard.
T2b: Dining Room. The tower's visitors eat here. There are two large tables, four long benches, six chairs, and a large dresser containing tableware.
T2c: Kitchen. The hostel's humble meals are cooked in a cast-iron pot over the fireplace. Berta's assistants sleep here near the hearth. A clearly visible trapdoor leads down to a cellar full of foodstuffs, wine, beer, and fuel for the fire.
T2d: Visitors' Rooms. Each of these guest rooms contains a low table, three stools, and three beds.
Hostel Visitors. The Hostel Visitors table details guests the characters might encounter in the hostel. All adult visitors use the commoner stat block. If the characters failed to earn Hadley's trust earlier, you can use these visitors to spur the plot forward.

## Hostel Visitors

d4 Visitor
1 Jurgen and Gorvis, two dwarf men, have been happily married for a century. They've come to the tower on their hundredth anniversary to see what their next hundred years of union will bring.
2 Durn, a human woman, is visiting the tower with her two children, June and Koll. Durn is a farmer, but all her crops failed this year. She has come to ask what next year's harvest will bring. She doesn't have the 100 gp required for an answer but hopes the sages will take pity on her.
3 Namaia, a human woman, is mayor of a small village about a week's walk from the tower. An upcoming election has her on edge, and she wants to know what her odds are of keeping her title.
4 Adavalis, an elf man, comes from a wealthy line of prominent sorcerers. He's never manifested any sorcerous power and wants to know if he'll ever gain such power, or if he should give up hope.

## T3: Entrance Chamber

This hall serves as an entrance to the tower proper. Centuries of use have worn down its flagstone floor and the handles of its brass-paneled doors. Six gnome guards stand at attention along its walls.

Six members of the Griswill Garrison (lawful neutral, gnome guards) stand watch in this room. When it's time for a visitor's appointment in the Questioner's Hall (area T4), the guards walk across the bridge and call for the guest in the hostel. The guards then escort the visitor across the bridge, through the entrance chamber, and into the Questioner's Hall. The guards remain with the visitor until the answering ceremony is complete, then escort them back to the hostel.

## T4: Questioner's Hall

Four smoldering braziers dimly illuminate this somber hall. Dusty red curtains line the walls. The ceiling is darkened with soot, and the marble floor has been scuffed by the soles of countless feet.

Sages conduct fortune-telling sessions in this dimly lit hall. If the characters were escorted here by the gnome guards from area T3, those guards line up along the east wall for the duration of the ceremony, which begins shortly after the characters enter.

---

Answering Ceremony. Read or paraphrase the following text to begin the answering ceremony:

The curtains at the far end of the room part, and a red-robed human man enters the hall. He has broad, hunched shoulders, and his forearms are covered with starry red tattoos. Two humans in simple red robes accompany him.
"Welcome to the answering ceremony," the tattooed man intones, "where astrology and prophecy intertwine to answer all. What is your question?"

Lurg (lawful evil, human tower sage) conducts this ceremony. Two tower hands loyal to Lurg accompany him (see appendix B for both stat blocks).
If allowed to run its course, the ceremony is relatively simple and businesslike. Once a question has been asked, Lurg asks for a mandatory "donation" of 100 gp , no matter what the question is. One of his tower hands then collects the payment.
Once his fee is paid, Lurg announces he must consult the stars for the answers the visitors seek. Of course, Lurg can't access the Books of Prophecy, since Shalfey still has them locked away in his sanctum, so Lurg simply withdraws behind the west curtain and remains silent for 1 minute while he concocts a cryptic, meaningless answer. After he reemerges from the curtain and delivers his response, the guards escort the questioners back to the hostel, ending the ceremony.
Treasure. Lurg wears a gold chain belt worth 30 gp and carries the key to his desk (see area T14).

## T5: Mimic Door

A stone door set in the south wall bears a carved pattern of stars arranged in a circle.

The door is a mimic trained to guard the staircase. It functions like an ordinary door until a creature it doesn't recognize tries to open it, at which point the mimic reveals its true nature and attacks. The mimic is friendly toward the tower sages, tower hands, and gnomes of the Griswill Garrison.

## T6: Mergenaries' Hall

The smell of pipe smoke greets visitors to this raucous hall. Four gnomes sit here laughing, eating, and playing cards.

Three members of the Griswill Garrison (lawful neutral, gnome guards) sit here, relaxing between
shifts. Accompanying them is the garrison's leader, Captain Mainwaring (lawful neutral, gnome knight).
When she's aware of the characters, Captain Mainwaring calls the guards to arms, but characters can convince them to stand down with a successful DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check. Characters who mention Shalfey have advantage on this check.
If hostilities are defused, Captain Mainwaring listens to the characters' story. She doesn't fully believe Shalfey is alive unless shown undeniable evidence (such as Piyarz's unchanged tattoos or Shalfey himself). However, the characters can easily convince Mainwaring to give them the benefit of the doubt, and she agrees to overlook the characters' activities as they seek answers in the tower.
If combat breaks out in this room, the noise awakens the three guards in the barrack (area T7), who join the fight at the start of the third round.
Treasure. Captain Mainwaring wears a gold brooch worth 60 gp , and she carries a key to her chest in the barrack (area T7).

## T7: BARRACK

A weapon rack sits in the center of this large room. The walls are lined by fifteen small beds, three of which are occupied by snoozing gnomes. A slightly larger and more comfortable bed stands against the southeast wall, with a large lockbox at its foot.

At any given time, three members of the Griswill Garrison (lawful neutral, gnome guards) are sleeping in these beds with weapons close at hand. The larger bed belongs to Captain Mainwaring, leader of the Griswill Garrison (see area T6).
Treasure. The chest at the foot of Mainwaring's bed is locked, and the captain carries the key. As an action, a character can pick the lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check using thieves' tools. The chest contains a fine fur-trimmed robe worth 10 gp , a gold chain belt worth 60 gp , and a bag containing 180 gp (the collective wealth the gnomes have earned for their service).

## T8: StOREROOM

Dozens of boxes, casks, and sacks are neatly stacked on shelves and racks this storeroom, which holds food stores and equipment for the entire tower. Amid the provisions are two explorer's packs, two scholar's packs, and enough food and drink to sustain the tower's residents for a month.

## T9: Kitchen

A pot of squash soup simmers gently on a stove in this tidy kitchen, filling the room with its aroma. The kitchen otherwise holds nothing of interest.

MAP 35: Tower of the MEAvens

---

## T10: Trapped Hallway

This unfurnished hallway provides ladder access to the watchtowers on the third floor (area T11).
A protective glyph wards the staircase door down to area T17. To open this door safely from either direction, one must first say the password ("apogee"), which is known only to the tower's stewards. If the door is opened without the password, flame erupts in a 10 -foot-radius sphere centered on the glyph. Each creature in that area must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 13 (3d8) fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

## T11: Watchtowers

Six turrets rise from the Tower of the Heavens. Six members of the Griswill Garrison (lawful neutral, gnome guards) are stationed at each watchtower, for a total of thirty-six guards. The guards constantly watch for intruders, particularly those scaling the walls. When a guard spots an intruder, three guards remain at their post to fight while three run to area T6 to warn Captain Mainwaring.

## T12: Lesser Library

This library is bathed in supernatural silence. Two robed figures-a halfling man clad in blue and a dragonborn woman in yellow-work at tall desks amid ancient tomes, while other robed figures stand guard.

This library contains the less important books of the tower. Sage pupils Porro (lawful evil, halfling tower sage) and Cipolla (lawful evil, silver dragonborn tower sage) research in this room, accompanied by four tower hands sworn to protect them (see appendix B for both stat blocks). All are loyal to the illegitimate elder sage, Piyarz, and enforce his will.
When the characters enter, Cipolla and Porro silently direct the hands to attack. Meanwhile, the sages flee toward Piyarz in the scholars' hall (area T17), where they can more freely use their magic. Once there, Cipolla or Porro casts the Arcane Lock spell on the door to buy themselves time.
Silence. A permanent Silence spell pervades the library, eliminating all sound in this area. A Dispel Magic spell ends the effect. The magical silence prevents casting spells with verbal components.
Treasure. Porro and Cipolla wear gold chain belts worth 30 gp each. They each carry a key to their desk drawers (see areas T15 and T16).

## T13: Dormitory

Tower hands sleep in this stark dormitory, which contains only thirteen modest wooden beds with thin straw mattresses. It is currently unoccupied.

## T14: Lurg's Room

The walls and furniture of this room are painted deep crimson. Messy stacks of paper sit atop a writing desk, and the bed's maroon sheets are lazily bunched.

This is Lurg's private chamber. Its crimson walls match the color of his robes.
Lurg's desk drawer is locked and magically trapped. Lurg carries its key (see area T4), and only he knows the password to safely unlock the drawer: "Struve." As an action, a character can unlock the door with a successful DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check using thieves' tools. If the drawer is unlocked without first speaking the password, a magical glyph inside the drawer triggers, erupting with flame in a 10 -foot-radius sphere. Each creature in that area must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 13 (3d8) fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. The glyph vanishes after it triggers, and the flame doesn't damage the contents of the room.
Treasure. The desk drawer contains quills, ink, paper, a pouch holding 60 gp , and Lurg's spellbook. The spellbook contains the spells in the tower sage stat block (see appendix B) plus the following: Color Spray, Illusory Script, and Unseen Servant.

## T15: Porro's Room

Everything in this room, including the walls, is painted cerulean. Its contents are sized for a small inhabitant; the desk is two feet tall, and the bed is four feet long.

This is Porro's private chamber. Its cerulean walls match the color of his robes.
Porro's desk drawer is locked and magically trapped. Porro carries its key (see area T12), and only he knows the password to safely unlock the drawer: "Altair." As an action, a character can unlock the door with a successful DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check using thieves' tools. If the drawer is unlocked without first speaking the password, a magical glyph inside the drawer triggers, erupting with icy wind in a 10 -foot-radius sphere. Each creature in that area must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 13 (3d8) cold damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. The glyph vanishes after it triggers, and the wind doesn't damage the contents of the room.
Treasure. The desk drawer contains quills, ink, paper, a small necklace of emerald beads (worth 160 gp ), a pouch holding 30 gp , and Porro's spellbook. The spellbook contains the spells in the tower sage stat block (see appendix B) plus the following: Color Spray, Disguise Self, and Nystul's Magic Aura.

---

## T16: Cipolla's Room

A large, framed painting of the Tegefed Mountains adorns this room. The painting's golden hues complement the room's yellow walls and furniture.

This is Cipolla's private chamber. Its yellow walls match the color of her robes.
Cipolla's desk drawer is locked and magically trapped. Cipolla carries its key (see area T12), and only she knows the password to safely unlock the drawer: "Sol." As an action, a character can unlock the door with a successful DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check using thieves' tools. If the drawer is unlocked without first speaking the password, a magical glyph inside the drawer triggers, erupting with lightning in a 10 -foot-radius sphere. Each creature in that area must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 13 (3d8) lightning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. The glyph vanishes after it triggers, and the lightning doesn't damage the contents of the room.
Treasure. The desk drawer contains quills, ink, paper, a small horse figurine carved from coral (worth 100 gp ), a pouch holding 50 gp , and Cipolla's spellbook. The spellbook contains the spells in the tower sage stat block (see appendix B) plus the following: Color Spray, Fog Cloud, and Magic Mouth.

## T17: Scholars' Hall

Astrological symbols decorate this vast, lavish hall. A massive table of polished oak dominates the room.

Next to the table stands a short human mage with a goatee and gray robes. His arms are covered with intricate gray tattoos, and a small raven perches on his shoulder. Standing on either side of the table are two humans dressed in similar gray robes and hand wraps.

Piyarz is here with two tower hands (see appendix B). His loyal imp rests smugly on his shoulder in the form of a raven. Piyarz is a lawful evil tower sage (see appendix B) who wears a Ring of Fire Resistance, granting him resistance to fire damage.

If Cipolla or Porro successfully fled area T12, they're here as well, and one of them has cast the Arcane Lock spell on the south door to buy time.

Confronting Piyarz. If the characters don't attack instantly, Piyarz announces he'll "generously" give them one chance to explain themselves. A shrewd, calculating liar, Piyarz tries to make the characters doubt anything Hadley might have told them. Piyarz hopes to convince them his assumed title of elder sage is rightfully deserved. If he can't persuade the characters to leave, Piyarz and his allies attack, fighting to the death.

---

Treasure. Piyarz wears a Ring of Fire Resistance and a platinum chain belt worth 300 gp .

## T18: Piyarz's Room

Hovering above a large coffer in the center of this gray bedroom is a many-eyed, spherical creature three feet in diameter. In the middle of its forehead, a large unblinking eye regards you quizzically-as do four smaller eyes perched on the end of wiggling eyestalks.

The creature is a spectator in Piyarz's service. Commanded to guard the chamber, the spectator telepathically warns unauthorized entrants to "scram or get zapped" and attacks any who refuse.
In addition to the coffer, Piyarz's private chamber contains a bed, a chair, and a desk, all painted dull gray to match his robes.
Treasure. The desk has a drawer containing parchment, quills, and ink. The coffer is unlocked and contains two Potions of Healing (greater), a Folding Boat, 3,600 gp, and Piyarz's spellbook. The spellbook contains the spells in the tower sage stat block (see appendix B) plus the following: Color Spray, Find Familiar, Locate Object, Magic Missile, and Sleep.

## T19: Bridge of Faith

The thunder of rushing water fills this loud room. The room is divided in two by a yawning chasm, ten feet deep and surging with a foaming torrent. Inlaid on the walls of the room are the following words: "I am real. Watch your step, have faith, and pass safely."

The walls of this room are smooth, wet, and slippery. A character can climb along the wall to the other side with climbing gear and a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. On a failed check, the character falls into the rushing water below.

Rushing Water. Water rushes into the chasm from the river outside via concealed channels below the tower. A creature that falls into the chasm takes 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage as the river sweeps it away. The creature then washes up on the island's rocky outcropping just north of area T17.
Invisible Bridge. An invisible, 10 -foot-wide bridge spans the chasm. It has no railing but is otherwise straight and safe to traverse. A creature made aware of the bridge's presence-such as by casting the See Invisibility spell or interacting with it physicallycan make a DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check. On a successful check, the bridge becomes visible to that creature. Creatures that can't see the bridge can still feel their way across, albeit carefully.

## T20: Greater Library

Shalfey (lawful good, human tower sage with 4 levels of exhaustion; see appendix B) has locked himself inside this room and threatened to burn the Books of Prophecy if Piyarz breaks in. Both doors are under the effects of Arcane Lock spells that allow only Shalfey to open the doors normally. Shalfey has also reinforced each door with a barricade.
A character outside the library who introduces themself can make a DC 20 Charisma (Persuasion) check to convince Shalfey to let them in. Characters who recite Shalfey's secret phrase (see the "Flood of Memories" section earlier in this adventure) have advantage on this check. On a failed check, Shalfey condemns the character as an agent of Piyarz and orders them to step away from the door-or else.
Desperate Measures. Characters who force their way into Shalfey's sanctum risk him destroying the Books of Prophecy. Each door to the greater library has Armor Class 15, 50 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.
When the characters enter, Shalfey assumes the characters are Piyarz and his conspirators. Read or paraphrase the following text:
"You leave me no choice, Piyarz!" shouts a desperate voice as you enter this spacious library. A bearded man in white robes stands amid the shelves, his arms covered with intricate, softly glowing tattoos. A large, shimmering globe of light levitates behind him.

If the characters attempted to destroy the doors, Shalfey has already set the Books of Prophecy aflame. Read or paraphrase the following text:

The man's defiant face is lit by roaring flames from a pile of burning tomes before him. His outstretched hands flicker with waning, fiery magic. When he sees you, he looks both shocked and relieved.

Otherwise, they catch Shalfey before he makes a grave error. Read or paraphrase the following text:

With defiance in his eyes, the man extends his hands toward a pile of ancient tomes, his fingers ablaze with magic. When he sees you, his face softens in relief, and he slowly lowers his hands away from the tomes.

Conversing with Shalfey. Whether or not Shalfey burned the Books of Prophecy, he is relieved the characters aren't Piyarz and his minions. The elder sage asks why they came to the tower, then offers the following information:

---

Fallen Star. If the characters don't have the star, Shalfey encourages them to visit Derwyth (if they haven't done so) to find it for him. If the party has the notes from Derwyth's library (see area H5 earlier in this adventure), he uses those to quickly calculate the star's point of impact.
Piyarz. Shalfey explains that Piyarz attempted a coup. Shalfey asks the adventurers to defeat or exile Piyarz and the other traitorous sages (if they haven't done so already); the characters can keep the conspirators' possessions. Shalfey accompanies the characters if requested, but he's dangerously exhausted and avoids combat.
Shalfey's Motivations. If pressed about why he covets the star, Shalfey tells most of the truth but doesn't expose the sages' reliance on the Books of Prophecy. He explains that "through arduous study of ancient and esoteric tomes," he learned of svirfneblin smiths to the west who would exchange a "wondrous library" for a black rock from the heavens. He claims to have predicted the star's arrival through astronomical observation.
Shalfey's Quest. Once the traitorous sages are dealt with and the star is obtained, Shalfey asks the characters to take the star to the svirfneblin forge and exchange it for a set of books-the smiths will know which ones. Shalfey gives the party directions and promises to reward each character with a magic item from his treasury upon receipt of the books.
Shimmering Sphere. The levitating, scintillating sphere in this room is the tower's treasury, which Shalfey explains in esoteric terms to any character who asks. He alone can draw magic items from the sphere, as described in this adventure's conclusion.
Treasure. Shalfey wears a Medallion of Thoughts and a mithral chain belt worth 400 gp . While his old Books of Prophecy can no longer divine the future, they're a reliable source on significant historical events-though incomprehensible to anyone but a tower sage. If Shalfey set the Books of Prophecy on fire, they are unreadable.

## T21: LABYRINTH

Beyond the door to this room lies a swirling mass of colors and shapes that stretches into the distance.

A creature that enters the swirling mass finds itself alone in a labyrinthine demiplane of nauseating colors. A creature navigating this magical labyrinth must make a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Survival) check. On a failed check, the creature takes 10 (3d6) psychic damage, gains 1 level of exhaustion, and finds the exit after 10 minutes of wandering. On a successful check, the creature takes half as much damage only and finds

---

the exit after 1 minute. In either case, the creature emerges from the door opposite the one it entered.
As the true elder sage, Shalfey is immune to the labyrinth's ill effects and can navigate the maze without consequence (no check required).

## T22: Observatory

This rooftop observatory is surrounded by a decorative lattice of metal strips and glass panes, rising to create a dome atop the tower. A chair with a swiveling base sits in the center of the room, flanked by two stone statues of snarling winged creatures.

The sages make astronomical observations here. By observing the positions of the stars and planets relative to the lattice, the sages can precisely record the movements of the heavens.
The statues are two gargoyles. They're trained to attack any visitors unaccompanied by a tower sage or tower hand.
Characters can climb the tower's walls to this observatory, but doing so might draw the attention of the guards stationed in the watchtowers (area T11). The openings in the domed lattice are paned with glass and just wide enough for a Medium creature to squeeze through. Each pane has Armor Class 13, 3 hit points, and immunity to psychic and poison damage.

## FORGE OF THE KAGU-SVIRFNEBLIN

A small faction of svirfneblin-also known as deep gnomes-has established an underground lair beneath the Tegefed Mountains. When these svirfneblin were still young and foolhardy, they left the Underdark in search of precious stones. These smiths call themselves the kagu-svirfneblinGnomish for "stone-seekers."

## Prophecy of Prophecies

During their prospecting, the kagu-svirfneblin encountered a shimmering dome-not unlike the shimmering sphere found in the Tower of the Heavens. Near the dome, a stone tablet prophesied creatures would one day arrive at this very site bearing a fallen star. The tablet foretold this star would unlock the dome, whose contents must be exchanged for the star. Unknown to the kagu-svirfneblin, the dome contains a second set of Books of Prophecy.
Eager to claim the star for their collection and keep knowledge of it to themselves, the svirfneblin shattered the tablet and decided not to return to the Underdark. They settled around the dome and cut themselves off from their deep-dwelling kin.

The kagu-svirfneblin are now quite old, even by gnomish standards. In their isolation, they have devoted much of their time to making machines, and their lair is more akin to a forge than a home. Their obsession with the promised star has made them wary of outsiders.

## GrisDElfawR THE Dragon

Recently, a young red dragon named Grisdelfawr made a lair near the forge and began terrorizing any svirfneblin who dared venture outside. To distract the dragon, the svirfneblin corralled a horde of gibberlings (see appendix B), noisy fiends prevalent in the Underdark, and set them loose in the valley.

## Approaching the Forge

As the characters near the forge, they discover evidence of the creatures that dwell nearby.

## Scorched Earth

In the woods about two miles from the forge of the kagu-svirfneblin, the characters come across a gruesome scene. Read or paraphrase the following text:

A fifteen-foot stretch of woodland has been blackened by a concentrated blaze, and other nearby patches are similarly scorched. In one patch lies the charred corpse of a bald, grayish-purple gnome, which has been partially devoured by a larger predator.

Grisdelfawr killed the svirfneblin here a week ago and razed the area with his fiery breath. The dragon took a single bite of the gnome, wastefully leaving the rest of the corpse. A character who inspects it and succeeds on a DC 13 Wisdom (Medicine) check knows the bite was left by a large, reptilian creature. A subsequent successful DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) check reveals the predator was a dragon.

## Gibberling Horde

About one mile from the forge, the characters are beset by roaming gibberlings. Read or paraphrase:

A strange noise in the distance grows louder with each passing second. It sounds like a dozen shrieking voices, babbling and spitting incomprehensibly.

Moments later, three swarms of gibberlings (see appendix B) burst from a nearby thicket and stampede toward the characters. The gibberlings fight to the death as they try to tear the characters limb from limb.
After the characters deal with the gibberlings, the journey to the forge of the kagu-svirfneblin proceeds without complication. They arrive at area F1.

MAP 3.6: FORGE OF THE KAGU-SVIRFNEBLIN

---

## Forge Features

Unless otherwise stated, the kagu-svirfneblin forge has the following features:
Ceilings. Rooms have 30 -foot-high ceilings, and hallways have 10 -foot-high ceilings.
Doors. All doors are made of solid iron.
Lighting. The forge isn't illuminated. Area descriptions assume the characters have a light source or other means of seeing in the dark.

## Forge Locations

The following locations are keyed to map 3.6.

## F1: Misty Gulch

Leading off from the main valley is a narrow, steep-sided canyon. Warm mist rises from a stream, shrouding the canyon. Within the mist, you hear a creature babbling incessantly.

This area is lightly obscured by mist from a piping-hot stream. The noise comes from the gibberling in area F2.
Steamy Stream. A metal bridge spans this 5 -footdeep stream, which issues from the workshop in area F8 and is scalding hot. A creature that enters the stream for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 7 (2d6) fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

## F2: Lizard Pens

The cliff opens into a dark cave whose mouth is barred by a heavy metal grill. Behind the grill, two large lizards with saddles strapped to their backs hiss menacingly. Outside the cave paces a small creature with spindly limbs, matted fur, and wild eyes. The creature babbles, screeches, and shakes the bars, attempting to reach the lizards inside.

The svirfneblin keep two giant lizards trained as mounts in these pens. A gibberling (see appendix B) scrabbles at the bars in a frenzied attempt to get at the lizards. The gibberling attacks the characters on sight.
A padlock secures the gate. As an action, a character can pick the lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check using thieves' tools or wrench apart the bars with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check. If released, the giant lizards attack any creature they don't recognize.

As an action, a character can calm a lizard with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check, changing its attitude toward the party from hostile to indifferent. If the check succeeds by 5 or more, the lizard becomes friendly and willing to serve them as a mount.

## F3: Outer Hall

This grand room is completely unfurnished and polished to a metallic sheen. In the center of the floor rises an eight-foot-wide clockwork dome.

The dome in the center of the floor is a maschini-bozorg (see appendix B). It remains motionless until the characters enter the room or disturb it. The maschin-i-bozorg is hostile toward intruders and fights until destroyed.

## F4: Storerooms

The kagu-svirfneblin keep various goods in these three identical storerooms. Each room is long and narrow with iron storage carts along the walls.
The storerooms and their contents are detailed below.
F4a: Food. The carts in this room contain flour, dried vegetables, salted meats, and wine. These stores are worth 20 gp total.
F4b: Fuel. The carts in this room contain coal, oil, wood, and charcoal. These stores are worth 15 gp total.
F4c: Raw Materials. The carts in this room contain glass, clay, and tin worth 25 gp total.

## F5: Inner Hall

Warm, swirling vapor fills this large room, rising from a stream that crosses the room from south to north. A mist-clouded bridge rises over the stream. On the other side wait three dome-shaped clockwork machines. They puff steam threateningly but make no advances.
Moments later, seven grayish-purple, bald gnomes, each astride a giant lizard, appear behind the machines. "Peace!" one calls in a nasal voice. "Do you come for trade or war?"

This area is lightly obscured by mist and steam. The clockwork machines are three maschin-i-bozorgs (see appendix B), created by the kagu-svirfneblin to guard their forge. The seven svirfneblin-each riding a giant lizard-constitute the entire deep gnome population here. They eagerly expect the arrival of the prophesied star.

---

![img-30.jpeg](Quests%20from%20the%20Infinite%20Staircase_img-30.jpeg)

Steamy Stream. The steaming stream, which flows from the workshop in area F8, is scalding hot and 3 feet deep. A creature that enters the stream for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 7 (2d6) fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.
Parleying with the Kagu-Svirfneblin. If the characters respond peacefully, one of the svirfneblin approaches cautiously. She introduces herself as Ecklash the Burrow Warden, the faction's leader. Ecklash has a large burn across her cheek from a close call with the red dragon Grisdelfawr. Polite but frank, Ecklash does most of the talking for her group. She has an inkling the adventurers are the promised bearers of the fabled star.
As stone-seekers, the kagu-svirfneblin wish for nothing more than to add this "sky-stone" to their collection. The gnomes are brief and direct in their negotiations. In return for the star, kagu-svirfneblin agree to give the characters the contents of their shimmering dome (see area F9), but they require the star to open it. If the characters agree to their terms, the kagu-svirfneblin escort them to area F9 so the exchange can take place.
Fighting the Kagu-Svirfneblin. Combat with the kagu-svirfneblin and their maschin-i-bozorgs is likely to end poorly for the characters, and any
characters who fought the maschin-i-bozorg in area F3 recognize as much. If combat breaks out, the deep gnomes fight defensively and attempt to defuse the situation. They try to incapacitate the characters rather than kill them, hoping to resume peaceful negotiations once the characters have calmed down.

## F6: Dormitory

A metal table and seven metal chairs sit in the center of this spacious dormitory. Seven alcoves each contain an iron-framed bed, while an eighth alcove is blocked by a metal door secured with a heavy lock.

The kagu-svirfneblin eat and sleep here. Obsessed with their work and the prophesied stone, the deep gnomes have little regard for their own comfort.
The door to the eighth alcove is locked. As an action, a character can pick the lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check using thieves' tools or they can break down the door with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check.
Treasure. The locked alcove contains racks of items labeled in Gnomish. Among them are a Spell Scroll of Fire Shield, a Potion of Heroism labeled "magical vitality," and a jar of Keoghtom's Ointment mislabeled "war paint."

---

## F7: Treasury

A padlock secures the gate to this treasury. As an action, a character can pick the lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check using thieves' tools or wrench apart the bars with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check.
Two hook horrors reside within, guarding the kagu-svirfneblin's treasure. They lumber about in the darkness, tapping their long, bony claws along the floor. The hook horrors obey the deep gnomes but attack all other creatures on sight.
Treasure. In the rectangular chamber at the rear of the pen, the kagu-svirfneblin store gold and silver ingots (worth $1,200 \mathrm{gp}$ total) and a bag of uncut gems (worth 500 gp total).

## F8: WorkSHOP

This hot, humid room reverberates with the drumlike beat of steam-powered contraptions, whirring metal machines, and hissing pipes. The room also contains a few ordinary anvils, forges, and workbenches.

The machines are powered by steam from a large cylinder at the east end of the workshop, which is fed by a natural geyser. The kagu-svirfneblin built these machines according to their own designs, and only they know how to operate them. A character who tampers with the machines must make a DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check. On a successful check, the contraptions whir and move but nothing disastrous happens. On a failed check, the character takes 10 (3d6) fire damage from a blast of scalding steam.

## F9: Shimmering Dome

Multicolored light dances through this faceted room, shining from a scintillating dome set into the floor.

This is the dome the kagu-svirfneblin found long ago. They've never managed to pierce it. Characters who saw Shalfey's shimmering sphere (see area T20 of the Tower of the Heavens) notice both seem to be made of the same multicolored essence.
If the star is brought within 10 feet of the dome, read or paraphrase the following text:

The dome begins to brighten rapidly. Suddenly, the room flashes with prismatic radiance-and the dome vanishes in a haze of sparkling dust. In its place rests a neat stack of twenty leather-bound books.

When the dome vanishes, its magic bestows one last gift. Each creature who helped bring the star to the dome (including each of the characters) tingles with resilience, gaining 5 temporary hit points and resistance to fire damage until the next dawn.
Books of Prophecy. The stack of tomes is the second set of Books of Prophecy sought by Shalfey. The books are of little use to anyone other than the tower sages, who have dedicated countless years of study to understand them. The books weigh 60 pounds in total.
Once the characters trade the star to the kagu-svirfneblin for the new Books of Prophecy, proceed to the "After the Exchange" section.

## F10: Tunnel to the Underdark

This tunnel slopes down for many miles, eventually connecting to a greater tunnel system deep in the Underdark. Most parties have no reason to journey down it during this adventure, but the expansive realms below and their subterranean threats could be crafted by the DM for future adventures.

## After the Exchange

With the trade complete, the kagu-svirfneblin thank the characters and escort them back to the inner hall (area F5). They invite the characters to take whatever they want from the storerooms (area F4). The kagu-svirfneblin announce their purpose here is complete, and they're about to return to the Underdark, sealing off their tunnel to protect themselves from dragons and other outsiders.
The kagu-svirfneblin advise the characters to avoid the workshop (area F8), plainly informing them it's about to self-destruct. The peculiar smiths are unconcerned about the destruction of the forge; they can always build another.

## Evacuation of the Kagu-SVirfneblin

After warning the characters, the kagu-svirfneblin bid them goodbye and exit the inner hall through the southeast double door, accompanied by their maschin-i-bozorgs. They shut and lock the doors behind them. As the kagu-svirfneblin approach the tunnel to the Underdark (area F10), they collect the treasure and hook horrors, dead or alive, in areas F6 and F7. If any treasure is missing, the deep gnomes shrug and continue on their way.
After setting the machines in the workshop (area F8) to overload, the kagu-svirfneblin depart for the Underdark via the tunnel in area F10. The workshop machines soon begin to shake violently, causing the whole lair to tremble. One minute later, the steam cylinder in the workshop explodes, causing area F8 to cave in and dealing 70 (20d6) bludgeoning damage to any creatures still in that room.

---

![img-31.jpeg](Quests%20from%20the%20Infinite%20Staircase_img-31.jpeg)

## Death from Above

The detonation in the forge draws the attention of Grisdelfawr, the young red dragon who recently took up residence in the Tegefed Mountains. Within moments of the explosion, Grisdelfawr begins circling over the misty gulch (area F1).
When the characters exit the forge, read or paraphrase the following text:

As you exit the tunnel mouth, a blood-freezing cry rings from the sky above, followed by the baneful sound of leathery wings. A red dragon soars overhead. Leering hungrily at the valley below, it spots you and swoops down for the kill.

Grisdelfawr attacks the party on sight. Amoral and sadistic, the dragon fights without remorse. Grisdelfawr is astonished at the resilience of any who endure his breath, especially those who benefited from the magic of the kagu-svirfneblin's shimmering dome. If Grisdelfawr is reduced to 50 hit points or fewer, he retreats.
If characters stay inside the forge instead of heading outside to fight Grisdelfawr, the dragon waits outside for 1 hour-enough time for the characters to finish a short rest-then heads into the forge to devour anything with a pulse.

## ConCLUSION

If the characters return to the Tower of the Heavens with the entire second set of Books of Prophecy, Shalfey is overjoyed. In exchange for the books, he rewards each character with a magic item drawn from the shimmering sphere in his library.

## Shalfey's Reward

The shimmering sphere in the greater library (area T20 of the Tower of the Heavens) has existed since the tower's creation. No one quite remembers how it got there, but one thing is certain: only the elder sage of the Tower of the Heavens can reach into the sphere to pull forth magic weapons and items.
After receiving the books, Shalfey plucks an item for each character from the sphere, guided by its magic. Each character can choose one magic item from the following list:

- Amulet of Proof against Detection and Location
- Bag of Tricks (gray)
- Eversmoking Bottle
- Gem of Brightness
- Pearl of Power
- +1 Weapon (any)

Each item bears an intricate constellation motif that shimmers in the presence of starlight.
