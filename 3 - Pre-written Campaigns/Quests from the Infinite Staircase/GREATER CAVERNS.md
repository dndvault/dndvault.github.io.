---

This cave holds numerous types of fungi. Three giant lizards graze warily on the mushrooms.

The three giant lizards pose no threat to the characters. As they graze, the lizards nervously eye anyone who approaches them and keep their distance.
If a character casts the Speak with Animals spell or uses other means to communicate with the lizards, the reptiles explain one of their siblings was recently slain by a terrible, red-furred creature from a large cave to the west (see area G8). If the characters avenge the lizards' fallen kin, one of the lizards agrees to serve the party as a cavern guide and mount for the next hour.
Mushrooms. The fungi in this cavern are edible, and characters can forage food here without having to make an ability check.

## G7: Smooth Cavern

This wide cavern is strewn with boulders. A gaping sinkhole drops down near the cave's center and plummets into darkness.

Two gas spores grow in this cavern, one tucked among the boulders near the sinkhole and the other in the hole itself. When a creature comes within 30 feet of either spore, both spores attack.
Sinkhole. The sinkhole drops 75 feet down to a tunnel that runs 35 feet to the east, then drops another 100 feet to an underground stream. What lies beyond the stream is outside the scope of this adventure.

## G8: Cavern of Stalagmites

Four thick stalagmites, twenty feet high and with tops worn smooth, rise from the center of this large cave. Baleful crimson light leaks from cracks in the jagged pillars, casting an eerie glow on the cave.

Four barlguras lair in this dimly lit cave. Each demon perches on one of the pillars, waiting to ambush unsuspecting entrants. When combat begins in this area, the pillars activate.
Demon Pillars. Iggwily conducted demonic experiments on the pillars in this cavern. Each round on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the pillars pulse with Abyssal energy. When this occurs, non-Fiends within 10 feet of one or more pillars must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw
![img-63.jpeg](Quests%20from%20the%20Infinite%20Staircase_img-63.jpeg)
or be warped by planar magic. Roll on the Abyssal Energy table to determine the effect, which lasts until the pillars pulse again or are destroyed.

## Abyssal Energy

d4 Abyssal Manifestation
1 The target's limbs become rubbery and unreliable. It has disadvantage on attack rolls with weapons.
2 The target's eyes squirm out of its head as worms; the target has the blinded condition.
3 The target's feet become heavy, fluid-filled sacs, reducing its walking speed by 10 feet.
4 The target's mouth vanishes, preventing it from speaking or casting spells with verbal components.
Destroying the Pillars. Each of the pillars has Armor Class 17, 50 hit points, immunity to poison and psychic damage, and vulnerability to radiant damage. Destroying the pillars prevents them from emitting Abyssal energy. A Hallow spell cleanses the pillars, accomplishing the same feat.

---

Unusual fungi and lichen cover this irregular cavern. The growths are limned in auras of blue and pink light. Many-faceted crystals grow around the periphery, reflecting the light in scintillating patterns.

This dimly lit cave is a planar nexus through which Iggwilv once explored the multiverse. Fungi from the Feywild and crystals harvested from the deepest reaches of the Astral Plane fuel the cave's glow and anchor the planar magic that lingers here.
Planar Displacement. When a creature enters the grotto, a flare of magic teleports the entrant and creatures within 10 feet of it to one of the Outer Planes. Roll on the Grotto Destination table to determine where the creatures are sent. For the next minute, any creature that enters the grotto is transported to the same destination. Due to their planar nature, these areas don't appear on map 6.3.
The following sections detail these locations and how creatures transported to them can return to the Lost Caverns. Once a creature has been transported to a location in this way, it can't be sent to that destination by entering the grotto for 24 hours.

## Grotto Destination

d4 Destination
1 Abyssal labyrinth (area G9a)
2 Elysian canyon (area G9b)
3 Infernal hall (area G9c)
4 Mechanized checkpoint (area G9d)

## G9A: Abyssal Labyrinth

A flash of sickly green light fades to reveal rough-hewn tunnels bored into black stone. The air reeks of animal stench. Chuffing growls echo from the darkness.
Two muscular humanoids with bull heads emerge from the darkness. They brandish axes and lead metallic bulls whose nostrils exude a noxious vapor.

This immense labyrinth is part of the Endless Maze-a layer of the Abyss ruled by the bloodthirsty demon lord Baphomet. The labyrinth fills a region of the Abyss roughly 1 mile on each side. The labyrinth's tunnels are 20 feet wide, 50 feet high, marred with scratches, and stained with blood.
The characters arrive in the presence of two minotaurs, each accompanied by a gorgon. Servants of Baphomet, the minotaurs seek to offer up the characters' heads as gifts to the demon lord. The gorgons obey the minotaurs' spoken commands.

Escaping the Labyrinth. When the characters negotiate the labyrinth, have them choose a navigator and their pace (fast, normal, or slow). It takes 1 hour to navigate the maze at a fast pace, 2 hours at a normal pace, or 3 hours at a slow pace. Halfway through the journey, the navigator must make a DC 16 Wisdom (Survival) check. If the characters are moving at a fast pace, the navigator makes the check with disadvantage, while a slow pace allows them to make the check with advantage. On a successful check, the characters find their way out. On a failed check, the characters must restart the labyrinth.
The longer the characters take to navigate the maze, the greater the risk of encountering the creatures within it. Every 30 minutes the party spends in the maze, roll on the Labyrinth Encounters table to see what, if anything, the characters meet.
The labyrinth's exit is a one-way portal at the end of a clean, misty tunnel. Creatures that pass through the portal emerge in front of area G9 of the Lost Caverns.

## LABYRINTH ENCOUNTERS

d20 Encounter
1-10 No encounter
11-12 A row of humanoid heads on pikes
13-14 A bloodthirsty hill giant with crooked horns
15-16 An enormous, rampaging giant bull (use the mammoth stat block)
17-18 1d6 minotaurs
19-20 An aspect of the demon lord Baphomet (use the goristro stat block)
Treasure. Near the labyrinth's exit, a desiccated, severed hand clutches a +2 Greataxe.

## G9b: Elysian Canyon

A flash of golden light gives way to warm sunlight. The rocky floor of a steep canyon stretches before you, its sheer walls rising overhead. Fallen rocks-the result of a recent rockslide-block the canyon's exit.
Six centaurs stand nearby. One trots forward and calls out to you. "Unfortunate timing! We're all trapped, but perhaps we can help each other?"

This box canyon on the plane of Elysium tests the compassion and resolve of those trapped within. Six centaurs who speak Common were exploring the canyon when its walls collapsed, stranding them here. Unable to scale the sheer, 60 -foot-high walls, the centaurs are out of ideas. The centaurs are friendly toward the characters unless attacked.

---

Shaydun, the centaurs' leader, approaches the characters. She doesn't know how the characters arrived in the canyon, but she's willing to help them find a way back to the Lost Caverns if they help the centaurs escape the canyon.
Escaping the Canyon. The characters can escape the canyon by the following means:

## Clearing the Rubble. A character who inspects

the rubble and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check notices a protruding boulder that, if dislodged, could open a way through to the canyon beyond. A character can knock the boulder loose with a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check. If the characters fasten ropes to the boulder, the centaurs offer to help haul it down for them (no check required). Freeing the boulder clears a path through the rubble.
Climbing Out. Scaling the canyon's walls without climbing gear or magic requires a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check. The centaurs can't manage this climb. At the top of the canyon is a golden-barked oak tree the characters can use as an anchor for rope or other climbing equipment.
At your discretion, other means of exiting the canyon might exist. Either way, once the characters have freed themselves, they can easily help the centaurs do the same.
Treasure. Shaydun wears a magic necklace adorned with a small silver horseshoe. The necklace allows the creature wearing it to cast the Plane Shift spell once, after which the necklace loses its magic.
In exchange for helping the centaurs escape the canyon, Shaydun gifts the characters her necklace. If a character uses the necklace to return to the Lost Caverns, they do so unerringly, appearing in front of area G9.

## G9c: Infernal Hall

A flash of red light fades to reveal a seemingly endless obsidian hall. Rows of decorative columns hoist a flat, mirrorlike ceiling high above. The columns are carved in the likeness of two alluring yet imposing devils whose eyes seem to follow you. Ruddy light filters into the room from somewhere beyond the pillars, and the air is dry and oppressively hot.
Beneath each of you is a faintly glowing pentacle of green metal inlaid in the stone floor.

This infernal hall is located within an abandoned courthouse on Phlegethos, the fourth layer of the Nine Hells. The hall is 60 feet wide and has 30 -foothigh ceilings, but it is infinitely long and unbearably
hot. The hall constitutes an area of extreme heat (see the Dungeon Master's Guide).
When the characters arrive, each of them is trapped in one of the pentacles (detailed below).
Devil Columns. The figures carved into the columns represent Belial and Fierna, joint rulers of the fourth layer of the Nine Hells. A character who succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence (Religion) check recognizes the archdevils and the plane on which the hall resides. A character can climb the columns without having to make an ability check.
Mirror Ceiling. A character who looks up at the ceiling sees the floor of the glowing grotto (area G9) reflected in its surface. A character who studies the ceiling and succeeds on a DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) check notices faint ripples in its surface, like that of a pool.
Pentacles. A 10 -foot-diameter, 20 -foot-tall cylinder of magical force surrounds each pentacle, confining a creature within its bounds. Skeletons of creatures that never escaped the magical prisons dot the pentacles along the infinite hall. Fortunately for the characters, Iggwilv built a fail-safe into the pentacles when she created them ages ago in case her enemies ever tried to use them against her.
A Levitate spell allows a creature imprisoned in one of the pentacles to rise through the prison's area of effect and up to the ceiling. This exception doesn't apply to other forms of flight, such as the Fly spell or wings.
A character who examines the pentacle beneath them and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check notices smudges along the metal, suggesting someone traced the shape in the past. If the character traces the shape of the pentacle imprisoning them, they gain the effects of a Levitate spell for 1 minute, with no concentration required.
Escaping the Hall. To escape the hall, the characters must overcome their magical prisons. They can escape the pentacles through the following means:
Dispelling the Circle. A successful Dispel Magic spell (DC 15) cast on the pentacle suppresses its magic for 1 hour, freeing the creature inside.
Levitation. A Levitate spell allows a character to rise out of the pentacle's area of effect.
Teleportation. A character who first succeeds on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw can then teleport outside the circle as normal. On a failed save, the attempt is wasted.
A creature that ascends to the ceiling is transported to the Lost Caverns in front of area G9.
Treasure. Propped against a column near one of the pentacles is a Weapon of Warning (glaive) veined with hellfire.

---

## G9d: Mechanized Checkpoint

A copper-hued light flares and then fades, revealing a doorless, perfectly cubic room made of brass, copper, and steel. The walls are composed of interlocking gears, metal plates, and whirring machinery that rotate, shift, and tick to a synchronized beat.

The center of a wall reconfigures and opens, revealing three armored automatons. They march forward in unison, drawing weapons and readying shields.

This checkpoint is located on Mechanus, a plane of absolute order. The three automatons (lawful neutral helmed horrors) attack the characters, who are unauthorized visitors. On initiative count 20 of the next round (losing initiative ties), up to three more automatons (lawful neutral suits of animated armor) emerge from the wall to replace any that were slain. These reinforcements continue to appear until the characters leave the area or die trying.
Escaping the Checkpoint. When an automaton is destroyed, its armored body crumbles to the floor as individual components. This includes its intact helmet, whose interior glows with a similar copper light to the flare that deposited the characters here. A character who dons the helmet is transported back to the Lost Caverns in front of area G9. The helmet then crumbles to dust.

## G10: Jagged Cavern

This cavern is dimly lit by a multitude of candles. The walls are jagged, and the cave's floor is littered with broken skulls and splintered bones. In the center of the cave, a staircase ascends to a carved stone altar etched with leering demon faces. A sinister tome bound with black demon hide rests atop the altar.

Iggwilv once conjured demons and bound them to her service in this soaring cavern. Before she vanished, the Witch Queen left a deadly trap for anyone coveting her knowledge.
False Demonomicon. The book on the altar looks like the Demonomicon of Iggwilv, the preeminent treatise on the Abyss and demons. A character unfamiliar with the book can identify it with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check. However, the book on the altar is a trap: a fake tome containing an unstable seed of Abyssal energy.
If the book is moved or touched, it flips open, and its pages shuffle as if disturbed by a phantom wind. A coruscating, 5 -foot-wide, 10 -foot-tall slash of red energy tears through the air above the pages, revealing a marred Abyssal landscape beyond.

Two chasmes buzz out from the rift and attack. At the end of each round, roll a d20. On a 10 or lower, another chasme wriggles through the portal.
Closing the Portal. The portal remains open for 1 hour or until six demons emerge, whichever comes first. The portal can be closed early through any of the following means:
Closing the Book. A character within 5 feet of the altar can close the book as an action with a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check.
Destroying the Book. The book has Armor Class 15,50 hit points, resistance to cold and fire damage, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.
Dispelling the Book. A Dispel Magic spell cast on the book suppresses its magic for 1 hour.
Closing the portal doesn't return escaped chasmes to the Abyss.
Treasure. Amid the bones on the floor is a Cloak of Elvenkind.

## G11: Cave of the Skull

A small silver coffer rests in the center of this cave. A bleached humanoid skull rests atop the box. A leather cloak lies near the skull.

The skull belonged to a wizard who challenged Iggwilv and lost badly. The garment nearby, however, is a motionless cloaker that ambushes any creature that approaches the coffer.
Treasure. The coffer is worth 750 gp . It contains ten cracked emeralds worth 100 gp each and a jar of Keoghtom's Ointment.

## G12: Pillared Cavern

Stalactites and stalagmites in this chamber have fused to form lumpy pillars extending from floor to ceiling.

Two ropers lurk among the calcite columns at the cavern's south end. The monsters attack when they can each lash out at a victim with their tendrils.

## G13: Rotting Fungus Cavern

This cave is thick with the stench of rotting fungus. A few mushrooms grow here and there, but most are dead and heaped in piles throughout the chamber.

The remains of rotting mushrooms litter this chamber. Three shambling mounds thrive amid the detritus. When the characters enter the cave, the creatures lurch out of the piles of filth and attack.

---

![img-64.jpeg](Quests%20from%20the%20Infinite%20Staircase_img-64.jpeg)

Within the lost Caverns, Iggwily penned her fabled treatise on demons. The tome disappeared when she did.

The stone giant in area G14 regularly tosses dead mushrooms in to feed the shambling mounds.
Treasure. Buried in the rotting mush is a collection of shiny objects the shambling mounds have gathered, including 340 gp , a Potion of Clairvoyance, and a silver scroll tube worth 125 gp containing a Spell Scroll of Cloudkill.

## G14: Giant Lair

Bones are scattered on the floor here. Two large round, black rocks sit in the rough center of the cave. A towering stone giant looms near the far wall. His skin is marred by cracks that radiate pale-green light.

This is the lair of Zyzkathol, a chaotic evil stone giant who succumbed to the demonic energy that permeates the greater caverns. He's accompanied by two giant beetles (use the rhinoceros stat block). When at rest, the beetles resemble boulders, requiring a successful DC 18 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern they're animate.
When he notices the characters, Zyzkathol barks a command and sets the beetles on them.
Treasure. Hidden in Zyzkathol's bedding is a sack sewn from a giant weasel pelt that contains 375 gp . The giant wears an ivory necklace worth 200 gp .

## G15: Fungus Garden

This cave is full of six-foot-tall mushrooms and other fungi growing in mounds of carefully spread compost.

The fungus here is a food source for many of the greater caverns' creatures, including eight shriekers that are currently feeding here. If the shriekers sound off, Zyzkathol and his giant beetles (see area G14) come to investigate.

## G16: Lofty Cavern

The ceiling of this large cave soars overhead, and natural ledges on the walls spiral upward. Broken stalactites litter the floor, and a pile of treasure is heaped against the west wall.

An adult black dragon named Calumnus recently moved into this vast cavern, whose natural ceiling rises to a height of 60 feet. Calumnus is aggressive and territorial, attacking all who enter, but the dragon retreats if reduced to 50 hit points or fewer.

---

Treasure. The treasure near the west wall is the dragon's hoard. It includes $67 \mathrm{pp}, 235 \mathrm{gp}, 2,750$ sp, assorted gems worth 700 gp , and an ivory case worth 300 gp containing a Wand of Magic Missiles.

## G17: Sanctuary CaVern

This large cave is awash with a sense of peace. The low ceiling and walls are striated with brightly colored rock. A trickle of spring water runs through a crack and collects in a small natural basin.

An aura of purity suffuses this tranquil cave. The greater caverns' fouler denizens avoid this area, making it a safe place for the characters to rest.
Hallowed Rest. This haven was made long ago by one of Iggwilv's enemies. A permanent Hallow spell (save DC 17) blankets the cave, with the following extra effect: Fiends and Undead can't see inside the cavern. The Corrupted Region feature of the greater caverns (see the "Greater Caverns Features" section) doesn't extend to this area.

## G18: Grotto of the Idol

A great stone idol stands over this grotto. The statue is carved in the likeness of a porcine-headed demon with puny wings and two jacinth eyes. On either side of it are brass stands with copper-bladed weapons.

A chest at the statue's feet rests with its lid open, revealing a collection of rings, bracers, brooches, small weapons, cloaks, arrows, and rods.

This chamber is yet another trap devised to foil would-be plunderers. The demonic idol uses the stone golem stat block but is carved in the likeness of a nalfeshnee. While the idol remains motionless, it's indistinguishable from an ordinary statue.
When the characters enter the chamber, a Magic Mouth spell cast on the idol utters the following:
"Leave one magic item before me, then take your choice of those others have left behind!"

If the characters attempt to take any of the items or otherwise disturb the idol, the idol attacks.
Illusions. The treasure and weapons in this room are illusions. A character who studies the objects and succeeds on a DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check discerns the illusions for what they are.
Treasure. The only legitimate treasures in this grotto are the idol's two jacinth eyes, which are worth 250 gp each.

## G19: Vestibules

Six nearly identical areas lead from the tunnels into Iggwilv's inner sanctum (area G21). When the characters approach one of the outer doors, read or paraphrase the following text:

An immense iron double door blocks your passage forward. A smokeless torch clutched in the mouth of a stone demon face above the doors illuminates the area. The doors are adorned with leering demon visages in bronze, and the doors' riveted edges are etched with arcane symbols.

The two largest demon faces hold unfurled bronze scrolls inlaid with a spidery script in their mouths. Large bronze pull rings sit below the scrolls.

Each set of doors is 10 feet wide and 20 feet tall. The script around the edges of the doors is a mixture of Abyssal writing and arcane sigils of Iggwilv's design. The bronze scrolls are inscribed with the following warning:

Iggwilv's treasure rests within, Her curse on any who disturbs it. Seek no further to steal it or To free the one prisoned here, For a fate worse than death is Sure to come to fools who Violate this sacred place.

The doors are unlocked but immensely heavy. When the characters enter a vestibule for the first time, read or paraphrase the following text:

A corridor with walls of red marble leads to an ebony door with silver hinges, studs, and a pull ring. The arched ceiling is made of black marble shot through with scarlet veins. The walls and floor are polished and dust-free, and a thick black carpet runs the length of the hall. Dim, ambient light illuminates the space.

The first hall the characters enter also contains a framed painting of a narrow boat on turbulent seas. A pale, raven-haired woman stands at the tiller, smiling under a stormy night sky.
Teleportation Lock. As the characters proceed down the hall, the air tingles with harmless but unsettling magic. When a creature opens the ebony door at the end of the hall, golden light flashes as the room's occupants are teleported to another part of the caverns. The door then swings closed.

---

The characters must open each of the six ebony doors before they can enter area G21, though the doors don't have to be opened in any specific order. A character who opens a door and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check discerns the nature of the lock and the number of doors that remain. The doors can't be bypassed through any other means. After all the doors have been opened at least once, their magic fades, allowing passage to the innermost chamber.
The Vestibule Destinations table summarizes the vestibules and where each room sends its occupants.

## Vestibule Destinations

| Vestibule | Destination |
| :-- | :-- |
| G19a | G20a |
| G19b | G20b |
| G19c | G20c |
| G19d | G20d |
| G19e | G20e |
| G19f | G20f |

## G20: Vestibule Destinations

Characters who open the doors in the vestibules (see area G19) are teleported to these intersections.

## G21: InNer SPHere

This chamber is bathed in bright amber light. A ledge of pale green serpentine lies just beyond the threshold, spanning the equator of a spherical chamber. A decorative openwork screen, carved from rich wood and inlaid with ivory, stands on the ledge in front of the door. Five other doors are spaced equidistant around the ledge, each with its own screen.
The upper hemisphere of the room is lapis lazuli, as dark as the night sky at the top and fading to the pale blue of a twilight horizon at the ledge. The lower half of the room is serpentine, gradually darkening from pale green near the equator to a deep, forest green at the bottom. The walls are smooth and polished.
A stone dais, topped with an alabaster slab inlaid with gold, rests in the center of the chamber below. A pale woman with long black hair and clad in ornate plate armor sits up slowly with a listless expression.
Surrounding the dais are Iggwilv's riches-sumptuous carpets, porcelain vessels displayed on inlaid stands, a polished side table holding a crystal bowl filled with a rainbow of gems, and a silver tripod brazier emitting a curling trail of sweet incense. Above it all, an ornate lantern set with gemstone lenses hangs from a gold chain, filling the room with its light.
![img-65.jpeg](Quests%20from%20the%20Infinite%20Staircase_img-65.jpeg)

---

The woman on the dais is Drelnza (see appendix B), the vampire daughter of Iggwilv.
Tasked with guarding the Witch Queen's treasures, Drelnza slumbers in this sanctum until all six ebony doors have been opened, at which point she awakes and plays the part of a warrior imprisoned here by Iggwilv.
When the characters descend from the ledge or otherwise make themselves known, Drelnza yawns and passes a hand across her brow, making a show of waking from a long, magical sleep. She introduces herself and welcomes her "rescuers," inquiring about the outside world seemingly to get her bearings. Drelnza spins a riveting tale about facing the Witch Queen in battle before succumbing to her evil magic. During the conversation, Drelnza uses her Charm action to sway as many of the characters as possible before she strikes. Drelnza fights to the death.
Arcane Security. The inner sphere is cloaked by a permanent Mordenkainen's Private Sanctum spell. The spell can't be dispelled-the magic is woven into the construction of the sphere. Iggwilv delighted in using her old rival's signature spell against his efforts to spy on her and locate her treasures.
Hidden Coffin. The interior of the marble dais is hollow. Drelnza's coffin is hidden within. A character who searches the dais and succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check notices hairthin gaps under the alabaster slab that forms the dais's lid.
The slab weighs 3,000 pounds. It has Armor Class 17, 50 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. A character can use an action to try to pry the slab from the dais, doing so with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check.
Revealing Light. Creatures and objects can't have the invisible condition while within the lantern's bright light.
Iggwilv's Hoard. In addition to Drelnza's sword, Heretic (see appendix A), the treasures on display in the sanctum include the following:

- Six decorative wooden screens ( $1,000 \mathrm{gp}$ each)
- Two carpets ( 750 gp each)
- Two inlaid stands ( 250 gp each)
- Four porcelain vessels ( 500 gp each)
- A crystal bowl ( $1,000 \mathrm{gp}$ ) filled with assorted gems worth $10,000 \mathrm{gp}$ in total
- A silver tripod brazier worth 300 gp
- Daoud's Wondrous Lanthorn (see appendix A), which hangs from the ceiling. The golden chain it hangs from is worth 500 gp .

An additional collection of magic is hidden within the hollow dais. Arranged at the foot of Drelnza's coffin are several magical tomes, which at the DM's discretion might include any of the following books:

- A Manual of Bodily Health
- A Manual of Gainful Exercise
- A Manual of Quickness of Action
- A Tome of Clear Thought
- A Tome of Leadership and Influence
- A Tome of Understanding

Additionally, Drelnza's coffin holds a small golden birdcage. The cage is a magical prison that functions as an Iron Flask. Unlike a typical Iron Flask, however, a creature trapped inside has the incapacitated condition but can perceive through the cage and converse with nearby creatures. The birdcage is filled with bracelets, rings, and necklaces made of platinum, diamonds, and rubies worth a total of $10,000 \mathrm{gp}$.
While impressive, the trove in this chamber is but a fraction of Iggwilv's untold wealth. The rest has been spirited away; the search for her other treasures could drive a larger campaign beyond the scope of this adventure.

## CONCLUSION

After the characters defeat Drelnza and claim their share of Iggwilv's lost treasures, they can rest safely in the inner sphere if they wish. The cavern's inhabitants don't dare breach the Witch Queen's former sanctum. Backtracking to the surface is a relatively simple task.
When the characters return to the margrave's agent at the Lazy Bat, Bannik can scarcely believe it. The characters are invited to return to the margrave's estate, where they receive a heroes' welcome and a banquet in their honor. High-ranking figures from Bissel and dignitaries from neighboring lands delight at the opportunity to meet the adventurers, hear their tales, and persuade them to part with some of their newfound wealth.
If the characters fail to secure Daoud's Wondrous Lanthorn (see appendix A) for the margrave or otherwise refuse to deliver the lantern, he still throws them a warm reception but secretly sends agents to recover the item after the characters depart.

## DEMONOMICON OF IGGWILV

In the original version of this adventure, Iggwilv's foremost treatise on the Abyss, the Demonomicon of Iggwilv, appeared as part of the trove in the departed archmage's inner sanctum. If you'd like to include that book as part of Iggwilv's hoard, you can find it described in Tasha's Cauldron of Everything.
