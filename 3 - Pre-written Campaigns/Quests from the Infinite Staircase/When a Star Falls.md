# When a Star Falls

or centuries, the Tower of the Heavens has stood silhouetted against the glittering night sky. The tower is a bastion of destiny where gifted sages peer into the future, doling out prophecies to visitors. When one such sage foresees a falling star, it sets in motion a series of events that threatens to put the power of prophecy into dangerous hands.
"When a Star Falls" is designed for four to six 4thlevel characters.

## BACKGROUND

According to local legend, the sages of the Tower of the Heavens can glimpse the future. Suppliants journey from distant regions to the tower, each bringing gold and a single question about their fate in hopes of receiving an answer from the sages.
Unknown to outsiders, the sages' talents come from their best-guarded secret: a series of ancient, magical tomes called the Books of Prophecy. The books chronicle events that have happened and those yet to pass; each cryptic page might detail a fate days, months, or years in the future. Shalfey, Elder Sage of the Tower of the Heavens, inherited the magic required to read these books from the line of sages who came before him-but this magic prevents him from turning more than one new page per day, allowing only a peek at the future. To keep the Books of Prophecy secret, the sages make a great show of the study and practice of astrology, pretending to divine the future from the stars.
A few days ago, Shalfey turned a page of his current Book of Prophecy and found it blank. Worse still, he found he now could turn the rest of the pages, which were also blank, save for the last. There, in clear words, the book foretold the arrival of a falling star-and the existence of a second set of Books of Prophecy possessed by a group of svirfneblin smiths. The elder sage resolved to plot the star's course, recover it, and trade it to the svirfneblin for the second set of tomes.
In anticipation of the star's descent, Shalfey sent his most trusted tower hands-martial artists sworn to defend the sages and obey their every order-to meet with Derwyth, a fellow star-watcher near the star's estimated point of impact. In the tower hands'

absence, Shalfey's power-hungry successor, the sage Piyarz, saw his mentor was unguarded and vulnerable. Piyarz and his mutinous faction of apprentices attempted a coup, but Shalfey fended them off and retreated to the safety of his sanctum, where he hides still. Foiled, Piyarz turned his attention to Shalfey's emissaries, hoping to find the star and steal the power of prophecy for himself.

## Using the Infinite Staircase

If you're using Nafas as a patron, he summons the characters to the Censer of Dreams (detailed in chapter 1), where he recounts the following wish:
"A prophetic sage by the name of Shalfey has uttered a hasty plea. He sent a group of robed sages into the mountains to intercept a falling star, but a creature imperils their journey. Seek these emissaries and help them bring the star to Shalfey when it falls. He dwells within a fortress known as the Tower of the Heavens."

Nafas then teleports the characters to a door along the Infinite Staircase that opens near the Tegefed Mountains. After the adventure, the characters can return to the staircase through the same portal.

## Adventure Hooks

If you're not using Nafas as a group patron, consider the following ways to involve the characters in this adventure:

In Search of Prophecies. The characters seek to have their fates read at the Tower of the Heavens. Whether the prophecies are real remains to be seen, but the characters are curious or desperate enough to pay a visit. The characters might also be researching historical information lost to all but those who deal in the business of fate.
Investigators. Dead travelers have been found in the hills south of the Tegefed Mountains-and the corpses reportedly have no visible wounds. The characters are hired by a mourning family to investigate these deaths and put a stop to them. The characters' encounter with the cause of these deaths-a strange predator called a memory web (see appendix B)-sparks the beginning of their adventure, as the creature's demise reveals a greater plot.

## Setting the Adventure

This adventure takes place in a region with a moderate climate, rolling hills, and winding rivers. The Tower of the Heavens lies far enough from major settlements that it sees only a few visitors at a time. Consider the following suggestions:
Eberron. The Tower of the Heavens could be the local name for the Starpeaks Observatory in Northern Aundair, with the Tegefed Mountains becoming the Starpeaks.
Forgotten Realms. The Tegefed Mountains could be in the eastern half of the Small Teeth mountain range, located in the region of Amn.
Greyhawk. You could place the Tegefed Mountains near the Crystalmist Mountains, where the Kingdom of Keoland borders the Yeomanry.

## Adventure Summary

The adventure begins when the party stumbles on the corpses of Shalfey's emissaries. The envoys were killed by a memory web-a living web that feasts on memories. When the characters defeat the memory web, they inherit the emissaries' memories, imprinting Shalfey's mission firmly in their minds. Shortly thereafter, the characters witness the prophesied star falling to the Tegefed Mountains. Later that night, the shadowy assassin Sion ambushes the party, seeking intel for his employer, Piyarz.
From there, the characters have two leads. They can investigate the Tower of the Heavens, or they can track down the messengers' intended contact, the druid Derwyth. The journey might lead characters to a cave of derro raiders, a lakeside community of hunters and giant beavers, or both.
Once the characters recover the star and defeat Piyarz, Shalfey sends them to a svirfneblin forge, where a group of smiths await the star. In exchange, the smiths give the characters a second set of Books of Prophecy for Shalfey, who rewards the characters on receipt of the tomes.

## Character Advancement

If you want to use story-based level advancement, the characters receive experience points for achieving the following milestones rather than defeating monsters:
Obtaining the Star or Saving Shalfey. When the characters either obtain the star from the derro lair or rescue Shalfey (whichever occurs first), everyone in the party gains 1 level. This advancement occurs only once.
Returning the Books of Prophecy. The characters gain 1 level when they deliver the second set of Books of Prophecy to Shalfey.
If you follow this method, the characters should reach 6th level by the adventure's conclusion.

## About the Original

Produced by the UK branch of TSR in 1984, When a Star Falls was written by Graeme Morris. The adventure is remembered for its intricate plot and unique adventure hook, which spurred characters to action by imprinting their minds with memories from a creature known as a memory web (see appendix B).
