# Pharaoh

EW DESERTS ARE AS HARSH AND INHOSPITABLE AS the Desert of Desolation, where the sun, the wind, and the land itself seem to despise all living things. The ghost of a long-dead pharaoh, Amun Sa (AH-muhn sah), roams the sun-scorched dunes, appearing to those who trek across the sands. Condemned to wander the desert for eternity, Amun Sa pleads with adventurers to free his cursed soul and save this doomed land-but none have returned from his pyramid. Within the pharaoh's tomb lie deadly traps, sinister threats, and the secret to ending the ancient curse.
"Pharaoh" is designed for four to six 7th-level characters.

## BACKGROUND

This section details the history of Amun Sa's curse and ways to involve the characters in the adventure.

## The Ruin of Bakar

Long ago, the kingdom of Bakar spanned what is now known as the Desert of Desolation. Though the land was already a desert, the mighty River Athis flowed through the region, making the land along its banks flourish. Animals, plants, and the citizens of Bakar prospered from its life-giving waters.

The pharaohs of Bakar believed that if their bodies were prepared with specific funerary rites and then entombed with their wealth, they could ascend to their chosen afterlife. Amun Sa, the last pharaoh of Bakar, took this tradition further than any of his predecessors. He was paranoid of grave robbers, believing that if his tomb were plundered, it would bar his passage to paradise. To safeguard his treasures, Amun Sa commissioned a theft-proof tomb, a solemn pyramid unlike anything the region had ever seen. To fund this elaborate and impenetrable fortress, he declared war on Bakar's neighboring lands and taxed his own people into destitution.

## A Curse on the Land

Downtrodden and impoverished, the citizens of Bakar revolted against Amun Sa to take back their kingdom. During a riot at the capital, Amun Sa appeared before his people and cursed them, holding high his two royal implements-the Staff of Ruling (see appendix A) and the star-gem of Mo-Pelar (a Gem of Seeing). He invoked the gods and decreed that if his people should ever kill him, the River Athis would cease its life-giving flow.

Suddenly, from the sea of upraised fists sped a single spear, piercing the pharaoh's heart; as Amun Sa died, so too did the river. The riverbed dried up within days, and without its waters, Bakar quickly collapsed. Over the years that followed, Bakar's cities were overtaken by the dunes, and its people fled to neighboring lands.

## A Curse on the Pharaoh

After his death, Amun Sa's spirit began its journey to the afterlife, but he was stopped by a god of death. The disapproving god chastised the pharaoh's spirit:
"Your legacy was meant to be the benefit you brought to the people under your stewardship, not this stone edifice. As you looked only to your death in life, so shall you look only to your life in death.
"I am bound to fulfill your curse, for you have called it down with power in my name. But I also curse you, Amun Sa, that you shall not voyage into the beyond until some mortal soul does as you so feared, removing your staff and star-gem from your tomb. Only then will your spirit and the land be healed."

Centuries later, Amun Sa's spirit still roams the desert, cursed to wander the dunes until he finds mortals skilled enough to overcome the traps and perils in his tomb and put his soul to rest.

---

## Using the Infinite Staircase

If you're using Nafas as a patron, he summons the characters to the Censer of Dreams (detailed in chapter 1), where he recounts the following wish:
"Condemned for his actions in life, the ghost of a long-dead pharaoh wanders the desert, day and night. Eons of torturous solitude have shown him the error of his ways, and he asks for brave mortals to free his soul and end an ancient curse upon the land. Seek him out and heed his call."

Nafas then teleports the characters to a door along the staircase that opens into a bleak desert. After the adventure, the characters can return to the staircase through the same portal.

## Adventure Hooks

If you're not using Nafas as a group patron, consider the following ways to involve the characters in this adventure:
Exiled. The characters committed a crime or earned the ire of a powerful figure and were exiled to the Desert of Desolation as punishment. They're left in the middle of the desert with no food or water.
River Restoration. The characters have heard tales of a magical river in this region whose waters foster bountiful crops and heal those who drink from it. Legends state a curse dried up that river eons ago. The characters have journeyed to the desert to find a way to end the curse and restore the river. They might have been hired by the Tears of Athis, a newly formed group of historians and priests dedicated to this goal.

## Setting the Adventure

The Desert of Desolation is part of Raurin, a vast desert in southeastern Faer√ªn in the Forgotten Realms. When the River Athis dried up, it transformed the kingdom of Bakar from a thriving oasis into Raurin's driest region.
However, the Desert of Desolation could be any desert of your choice, or an inhospitable stretch in an otherwise lush region, due to Amun Sa's curse. Consider the following suggestions:
Dragonlance. The adventure takes place in a small, cursed region within the Plains of Dust.
Eberron. The long-lost kingdom of Bakar occupied a portion of the Blade Desert that's now uninhabitable.
Greyhawk. The Desert of Desolation might be another name for the Bright Desert.

## Adventure Summary

"Pharaoh" begins with the characters wandering the Desert of Desolation. After enduring the desert's terrible monsters and harsh conditions, they happen on the ghost of Amun Sa, who beseeches them to enter his pyramid and retrieve his royal staff and star-gem to end the curse that blights both the land and his soul.
Inside the pyramid, the characters meet the Tears of Athis, a group of historians and priests from the surrounding regions who hope to restore the flow of the holy River Athis. While exploring the pyramid, the characters must navigate a false tomb, a disorienting maze, and halls rife with Undead, then overcome a mummy lord who stands in their way.
Once the characters exit the pyramid with Amun Sa's implements, the pharaoh's soul is freed and the curse on the land is lifted, restoring the River Athis. The descendants of Bakar can then reclaim their lands from the desert and prosper once more.

## About the Original

Pharaoh was originally published by Tracy and Laura Hickman's game company, DayStar West Media, in 1980. They later sold their adventures to TSR, which liked the adventures so much that it not only reprinted Pharaoh in 1982 but also hired Tracy Hickman. TSR later published two more adventures in the Desert of Desolation trilogy.
Pharaoh was praised for blending masterful dungeon design with a compelling narrative. A year later, the Hickmans built on those same strengths when they introduced the world to the vampire Strahd von Zarovich in 16: Ravenloft.

Design: Tracy and Laura Hickman

## Character Advancement

If you want to use story-based level advancement, the characters receive experience points for achieving the following milestones rather than defeating monsters:
Escape the Maze. The characters gain 1 level when they escape the Maze of Mists and reach the third floor of the pyramid for the first time.
Recover Amun Sa's Implements. The characters gain 1 level when they recover both the Staff of Ruling (see appendix A) and the star-gem of Mo-Pelar.
If you follow this method, the characters should reach 9 th level by the adventure's conclusion.

## DESERT OF DESOLATION

A centuries-old curse has made the Desert of Desolation uninhabitable. Nothing grows in the desert, and no one has settled its once-green hills since the reign of Amun Sa. The sun scorches its grayish dunes with unnatural intensity, and the few clouds that cross its barren sky bring only choking dust.
The adventure begins with the characters trekking through the desert. Depending on what brings the characters there, they might be searching for answers within the region or trying desperately to escape it. At your discretion, each of the characters might begin this adventure with a camel or a draft horse to ride.

## Desert Heat

For 1d6 hours of each day, the desert becomes unbearably hot, rising to temperatures well over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. The extreme heat has detrimental effects on creatures not acclimated to such environments (see the Dungeon Master's Guide).
In addition to resting, the characters can remove any accumulated levels of exhaustion by drinking the water of Athis, which still flows within Amun Sa's pyramid (detailed later in this adventure).

## Starting the Adventure

Read or paraphrase the following text to begin:
The gray mounds of the desert roll toward the horizon. Not one stone shows through the powdery sand, nor does a single insect scurry across its surface. All around you, the burning silence of the sea of sand is unnaturally oppressive and foreboding. Ash and dust billow around your feet and choke your parched throats. There are no landmarks in sight-except the sun, which seems to burn hotter than ever.

The characters wander the desert for two days before encountering the ghost of Amun Sa. At your discretion, Amun Sa's ghost can take longer to appear, exposing the characters to more of the desert's threats, which are detailed in the "Desert Encounters" section below.
When you're ready to progress the story, proceed to the "Ghost of Amun Sa" section.

## DESERT ENCOUNTERS

For each day the characters spend in the desert, roll on the Desert of Desolation Encounters table to determine what the characters encounter, rerolling duplicates.

## Desert of Desolation Encounters

d6 Encounter
1 Two bulettes with sandstone-textured carapaces burrow up from the dunes and attack. The bulettes focus on mounts and Small creatures in the party (if any), seeking to drag them beneath the sands.
2 The characters spot a lush oasis, but it's a mirage. A character who studies the oasis and succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check recognizes the illusion for what it is. A creature that enters the oasis steps into a quicksand pit (see the Dungeon Master's Guide).
3 A dust storm rises on the wind. The storm lasts 1 hour, during which time the characters have disadvantage on ranged weapon attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks. Shortly after the dust storm begins, an air elemental and eight dust mephits materialize from the sands and attack.
4 Four gricks lie in ambush just beneath the sand. Adapted to the desert climate, the gricks have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks to hide in desert terrain.
5 A snobbish efreeti royal saunters across the desert. He demands each character pledge a vow of fealty to him or face his wrath.
6 Two wyverns soar above the characters, circling them like vultures. After 1 minute, the wyverns swoop down and attack.

## GHOST OF AMUN SA

Eventually, the characters come across the ghost of Amun Sa. Read or paraphrase the following text:

A solitary man dressed in tattered clothing appears over the crest of a nearby dune. At first, he seems to shimmer in the heat and desert haze, but as he walks closer, it becomes apparent that he's a ghost.

---

This is the ghost of Amun Sa, former pharaoh of Bakar. He walks in a straight line that intersects the characters' path, shuffling along with a blank gaze like a haunted man.
Amun Sa doesn't notice the characters until he passes within 30 feet of them, at which point he turns to them and relates his sorrowful tale, as if in a trance. Read or paraphrase the following text:
"I am Amun Sa, son of the house of Mo-Pelar. My spirit has walked these sands for time uncounted in search of mighty heroes, to plead for their aid.
"In my time, I was pharaoh of this realm. It was green and beautiful, blessed by the gods with magical waters that gave life to our land and nurtured our crops. But I was a foolish and cruel ruler. I should have protected my subjects; instead, I taxed them into poverty to create a wondrous tomb for my own self-preservation. When they rebelled, I cursed them and this land.
"With my dying breath, the curse was fulfilled, but my soul was cursed as well. I am doomed to walk these sands until a mortal soul retrieves the implements of my power from my tomb: my magic staff and the star-gem of Mo-Pelar. Only then will the curse be lifted, freeing my soul and healing this broken land.
"Many have tried, and none have succeeded. If you undo my terrible mistake by removing these two precious objects from my tomb, you may keep all the treasure you find within. Follow my path to wealth or woe, to destiny or doom."

Amun Sa then turns and walks somberly in the direction of his pyramid. Amun Sa doesn't speak to the characters any further-his curse allows him to share only the tale above. If the characters attempt to harm Amun Sa, he steps into the Border Ethereal and continues his solemn march. Amun Sa doesn't harm the party and makes no further attempts to defend himself. If Amun Sa's ghost is slain, he appears to the characters again in 1 hour with no memory of the previous encounter, relating his sad story again.
If the characters follow Amun Sa's ghost, they arrive at his pyramid the next evening. If questioned during the journey, Amun Sa recites his sad speech again, exactly as he did before. In the company of the pharaoh, the remaining trek is safe and uneventful, unless you'd like to add more desert encounters (see the "Desert Encounters" section).
Once Amun Sa arrives at the pyramid, he stops and gestures toward it. He then turns and walks away in search of more travelers.

## Pyramid of Amun Sa

The pyramid of Amun Sa was to be the pharaoh's final resting place. The last remnant of Bakar, it has stood for over a thousand years. When the characters arrive at the pyramid, read or paraphrase the following text:

Amid the vast desert, a great pyramid rises from the sands, barely touched by time. Stairs ascend from the sand to an opening in the pyramid.
Near the base of the stairs rests an empty basin one hundred feet in diameter. South of the basin, a deep stone channel cuts a path into the desert ground.

The pharaohs of Bakar built pyramids not merely as burial grounds but as part of a sacred process to convey a pharaoh's soul to the afterlife. These monuments also entomb the remains of their consorts and favored leaders, preparing pharaohs and their closest companions to dwell among the gods.
A character who examines the basin and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (History) check recognizes it as the Fountain of Athis, a former wellspring of life and the source of the River Athis. In Bakar's heyday, cool water sprang from the fountain, teleported to it from magical silos within the pyramid.
The Fountain of Athis dried up the night of Amun Sa's death. Only by breaking the pharaoh's curse can the basin resume its flow and the land thrive once more.

## Pyramid Features

The pyramid of Amun Sa is made of weathered limestone. Unless otherwise noted, the pyramid has the following features:
Ceilings. The ceilings in the pyramid's corridors are 10 feet high; those in rooms are 30 feet high.
Doors and Secret Doors. Doors throughout the pyramid are made of wood and banded with bronze; they have no locks. Secret doors blend in with their surroundings but are obvious from the other side. A character who searches a wall for a secret door must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to notice it.
Hieroglyphs. The ancient people of Bakar wrote in hieroglyphs, symbols representing letters, sounds, and words. A character can translate a passage of hieroglyphs with 10 minutes of study and a successful DC 13 Intelligence (History) check. Passages in different instances of boxed text require separate checks to translate. A creature under the effect of a Comprehend Languages spell can read hieroglyphs instantly (no check required).

---

Lighting. The pyramid's rooms are unlit. Area descriptions assume the characters have a light source or other means of seeing in the dark.
Temperature. The pyramid's interior is perpetually cool and dry, insulated from the desert heat.
Water of Athis. The River Athis still flows in certain areas of the pyramid. The water ends the poisoned condition on any creature that drinks it and removes all levels of exhaustion from the creature. Once a creature benefits from the water, it can't do so again until 24 hours have passed. The water loses its properties if it's bottled or otherwise removed from its source.

## Alterations to Magic

The following magical restrictions apply:
Teleportation Ward. Unless the text states otherwise, creatures can't teleport into or out of the pyramid or between its floors. Any attempt to do so is wasted.
Warded Walls. Magic that would alter the pyramid's stone-such as the Stone Shape or Passwall spells-has no effect on the pyramid.

## False Tomb

The lowest floor of the pyramid is a false tomb designed to discourage would-be tomb robbers. The people of Bakar also once used it as a temple.
The following locations are keyed to map 5.1.

## Pl: Tomb Entrance

The stairs outside the pyramid lead to this outdoor platform. When the characters approach, read:

Two people stand on a platform at the top of the stairs, flanking the pyramid's arched entrance, which is capped by a stone awning. The figures carry curved swords and are dressed in light, airy attire suited to the desert heat. Each also holds a torch.

Two siblings, Atfez and Pachi (neutral good, human bandit captains), stand guard outside the pyramid's entrance, keeping watch for creatures that might disrupt their faction's activities within. Atfez and Pachi are members of the Tears of Athis, a group of historians, priests, and descendants of Bakar who hope to see the River Athis flow once more.
When Atfez and Pachi notice the characters, they're surprised to see other people in the desert, especially at night. Atfez, the more assertive sibling, interrogates the characters about their presence, while Pachi observes and periodically apologizes for her brother's prying. If the characters make it clear they mean no harm, Atfez and Pachi let them enter. Otherwise, they ask the characters to leave, defending themselves as necessary.

---

The air is cool and still in this vast limestone chamber. Three pillars line each side of the room, and corridors lead to the east and west. A twenty-foot-tall statue of Amun Sa stands before the north wall. The room is brightly lit by sconces on the pillars.
An intricate fresco once adorned the walls with artwork and hieroglyphs. Now, much of its plaster lies shattered on the floor. A human woman in priestly robes paces about the room, overseeing five scholars who work to reattach the pieces to the walls.

The people of Bakar were meant to pay their respects to the deceased pharaoh here. In the centuries after the fall of Bakar, the walls were destroyed by disgruntled citizens and roaming vandals.
The robed woman is Iaseda (lawful good, human acolyte), leader of the Tears of Athis. She is fifty years old and has a calm, determined manner. Around her, five more members of the Tears of Athis (neutral good scouts) use a sticky paste to carefully repair the room's plaster walls, which they hope hold clues to restoring the River Athis. If the characters were peaceful toward the guards outside the pyramid, Iaseda is friendly toward them. If the characters pose a threat to the Tears of Athis, Iaseda and her fellow Tears defend themselves and the pyramid fiercely, decrying the characters as defilers.
What Iaseda Knows. Iaseda can relay the history of Bakar (detailed in this adventure's background), but she doesn't know about the fate of Amun Sa's spirit or that his ghost wanders the desert. Iaseda can also share information on the following topics:
Pyramid. This pyramid is the tomb of Amun Sa, the last pharaoh of a bygone kingdom known as Bakar that once occupied these lands.
Tears of Athis. Iaseda leads of the Tears of Athis, a newly formed group of historians, priests, and descendants of the people of Bakar. The Tears of Athis arrived at the pyramid two days ago. They seek to restore the River Athis. Amun Sa built his tomb at the river's source, so it stands to reason the secret to reviving it might be found inside.
Tidings of a Ghost. If the characters recount their experience with the pharaoh's ghost, Iaseda is skeptical. She jokingly suggests the characters have spent too much time in the desert heat.
Wall Translations. The Tears of Athis originally brought experts on Bakarian hieroglyphs with them on their expedition. Unfortunately, a purple worm ate those experts. Although the surviving Tears have made good progress reassembling this room's broken plaster, they haven't yet translated any of the hieroglyphs.

Hieroglyphs. The hieroglyphs on the walls were carved by Amun Sa's scribes while he lived, at his dictation. See the "Pyramid Features" section for guidance on translating hieroglyphs throughout the tomb. If translated, the east wall's hieroglyphs read:
"I, Amun Sa, set forth a record of myself and of my dealings with this world. Our land is rich with green and fertile fields. The River Athis is the mother of our land, giving life with its waters. Athis nourishes all she touches and gives strength and health to her children. In my youth, my father, the pharaoh, would sit with me beside the spring and tell me stories of the river's wonderful power and the blessings it gives unto this land."

If translated, the south wall's hieroglyphs read:
"In the years that followed, I learned of the passing of the pharaohs and how our tombs could guarantee a path into our chosen afterlife. I watched as my father built a tomb for himself, to guard against bandits who might plunder his tomb, robbing him of his refuge in the beyond. Yet, only a few years after my father's death, his great burial place was desecrated by thieves. I was tortured by the thought of his spirit wandering the planes alone forever."

If translated, the west wall's hieroglyphs read:
"Cloaked in the darkness of night, I went to my father's tomb to witness the truth with my own eyes. My father's riches were plundered, and the hull of his ship, once jewel-encrusted, was bare and scarred with gouges. I knew with certainty he could not have approached his afterlife in such a boat. As my torch went out, so did the light within my soul. Clutching my staff, I swore by the gods that I would not be cheated of my place in the great beyond. I would build a tomb to end all tombs-one that none could ever despoil."

Secret Door. The statue of Amun Sa conceals a secret door that leads to area P7.

## P3: West Offering Temple

A twenty-foot-tall statue of Amun Sa stands before the north wall of this square room, which rises to a domed ceiling. A few tidy cots lie along the floor.

---

The Tears of Athis camp in this room. They sleep here when they're not restoring the walls in area P2.
Secret Door. The statue of Amun Sa conceals a door that leads to the hall between areas P5 and P7.

## P4: East Offering Temple

A domed ceiling caps this well-lit room. Burning wall sconces illuminate ancient script along the walls. To the north, a twenty-foot-tall statue of Amun Sa, arms outstretched, holds an enormous altar bowl of blazing fire. A stone staircase ascends to the bowl, with hieroglyphs carved into the face of the lowest step.

This room is brightly lit by Continual Flame spells cast on wall sconces. When Amun Sa was interred, his most loyal priests dutifully locked themselves inside the pyramid's upper floors. In the brief period between Amun Sa's death and the collapse of Bakar, the people of Bakar brought food and drink to this room. They believed they were bringing offerings for the gods, but in truth, they were sending sustenance to the priests in the pyramid.
Hieroglyphs. If translated (see the "Pyramid Features" section), the hieroglyphs read as follows:
"Lay your offerings of food and drink for the gods in the blazing fire before Amun Sa. That which the gods accept will vanish within the flame."

Offering Bowl. The bowl's flame gives off neither heat nor smoke. Whenever an object or creature enters the bowl, the flames surge around the object or creature, concealing it completely and teleporting it to area P13 of the pyramid's second floor. To an onlooker, the object or creature appears to be consumed by the flame, vanishing in an instant. An onlooker who succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence (Arcana) check can tell that the bowl teleported its contents somewhere else. A Detect Magic spell reveals an aura of conjuration magic around the bowl.

## P5: West Storage Silo

The corridor opens into a cylindrical shaft thirty feet in diameter whose slick walls drop into the darkness below. A domed ceiling peaks thirty feet above the floor of the hallway leading to this humid chamber.

The shaft drops 120 feet to the surface of the murky water below, which is 30 feet deep.
Water of Athis. The water of Athis (see the "Pyramid Features" section) fills the bottom of the silo.
![img-46.jpeg](Quests%20from%20the%20Infinite%20Staircase_img-46.jpeg)

## P6: East Storage Silo

The thunderous sound of cascading water fills this chamber, which is otherwise identical to area P5.
The shaft drops 120 feet into turbulent white water. Fifty feet below the entrance, water gushes from an opening in the north wall and falls into the reservoir below, which is 30 feet deep.
Before the curse befell Bakar, this silo used to teleport water from this room into the now-dry fountain outside the pyramid. Now, the water merely pours out here and evaporates at an accelerated rate. If the curse is broken, the silo's teleportation functions again.
Water of Athis. The water of Athis (see the "Pyramid Features" section) fills the bottom of the silo.

---

## P7: Worship Room

A twenty-foot-tall statue of Amun Sa stands before the north wall of this worship room. There are no hieroglyphs on the walls, and the ceiling is flat.
Secret Door. The statue of Amun Sa conceals a secret door that leads to area P8.

## P8: Descending Corridor

This arched corridor descends at a slight angle toward the false tomb (area P12). A musty smell pervades the hall, and dust covers the floor.

## P9: Great Worship Room

The walls of this room are lined with seven statues of Amun Sa: three to the north, two to the east, and two to the west. In the center of the room stands an altar. Side-by-side impressions of a left and right hand are carved into the front of the altar. On the ceiling and along the rest of the walls, the name "Amun Sa" has been carved repeatedly in multiple languages.

Most of the statues in this worship room are ordinary decor-except for the center statue on the north wall, which can be opened as a typical secret door, and the southernmost statue near the east wall, which swings aside to reveal a hallway once the altar unlocks it (described below).
Altar. If a character puts their hands in the altar impressions and says "Amun Sa," the southernmost statue on the eastern wall swings inward to reveal a corridor to area P10.
Secret Door. The center statue of Amun Sa on the north wall conceals a secret door that leads to an empty, 15 -foot-long corridor with tiny holes in the walls. A character who inspects the corridor's walls and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check can tell that the corridor once contained a sleeping gas trap, but the trap was sprung ages ago.

## P10: Grand Hallway

This hallway slopes down at a slight angle. The plaster from the great frescoes that once covered these walls has fallen to rubble. Blade marks cover the walls. The remnants of a broken door lie at the corridor's northern opening. Dust blankets everything, and the air is very dry.

This hall was prepared to fool robbers into thinking the tomb had already been plundered before their arrival. Amun Sa's priests hacked up the decor before the pharaoh was laid to rest.

## P11: Treasure Room

Beyond the broken door is a huge room scattered with broken pots and chests that have been largely hewn into pieces. Everything is covered with a thick layer of dust, apart from a still-intact chest and two vases.

As in area P10, this scene was staged by the priests of Amun Sa long ago. Three hostile mimics lie in wait here, disguised as an unbroken chest and a couple of intact vases.

## P12: TOMB

In the center of this cool, dark room rests an ornate stone sarcophagus. Its lid is ajar and broken, and it contains nothing but dust. Hieroglyphs appear to have been hastily chiseled into the north wall.

As in area P10, this scene was staged by the priests of Amun Sa during the pyramid's construction.
Hieroglyphs. If translated (see the "Pyramid Features" section), the hieroglyphs read as follows:
"Here lies the tomb of Amun Sa.
Know that ye have arrived too late
To plunder his ransom for heaven's gate."

## Maze of Mists

The second floor of the pyramid is the Maze of Mists: a vast, confounding maze designed to defeat clever intruders who bypass the false tomb by way of the offering bowl in area P4. Amun Sa commissioned an infamous mage named Kordan to create it; Kordan filled the maze's rooms with bloodthirsty creatures and its halls with a disorienting, rust-orange mist.
For each hour the party spends in the Maze of Mists, roll a d6. On a roll of 1, an encounter occurs. To determine what the characters encounter, roll on the Random Maze of Mists Encounters table, rerolling duplicates.
The following locations are keyed to map 5.2.

## Random Maze of Mists Encounters

d4 Encounter
1 Four phase spiders
2 Two invisible stalkers
3 Eight ghouls
4 Two minotaurs chasing a scared human bandit who belongs to the Hands of Plenty (see area P16)

---

This octagonal room has a domed ceiling and smells faintly of sulfur. The scent comes from four doorways spaced evenly around the room. Each doorway is filled with rusty-orange mist. Between the doorways are four levers set into the walls.

A skeleton lies in the center of the room, loosely gripping a sword that points at one of the doorways.

The skeleton belonged to a Humanoid explorer; its sword points toward the west exit. Characters teleported to this level by the bowl of magical fire in the east offering room (area P4) might be disoriented and not know which direction is north.
Magnetic Trap. Lifting any of the levers along the walls triggers a magnetic trap within the chamber's ceiling. Each creature in the room wearing metal armor is pulled up to the 30 -foot-high ceiling, as are any metal objects or weapons that aren't being worn or carried. A creature affected by the magnetic field collides with the ceiling; the creature takes 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage and has the prone and restrained conditions until the field is deactivated.
To deactivate the magnetic field, all the levers in the room must be reset to their downward position, at which point creatures and objects naturally fall to the floor. Casting Dispel Magic on the ceiling deactivates the magnetic field permanently. The levers are lightweight and easily maneuvered. A creature can attempt to move a lever by hitting it with a ranged attack; each lever has Armor Class 10, and on a hit, the attack deals no damage and instead switches the lever's position.

## P14: Mists and Corridors

Sections of these hallways are filled with an orange mist (marked on map 5.2). The first time a character enters one of these misty areas, read or paraphrase the following text:

As you enter the rust-orange mist, the scent of sulfur floods your nostrils. You feel slightly lightheaded. This mist confuses your faculties and sense of direction.

The mists heavily obscure vision and magically disorient those inside them. Such creatures lose all sense of distance and direction while in the mists. Creatures feeling their way along the walls find their sense of touch numbed, so they're never quite sure if they rounded a corner or continued straight.
Because of these effects, don't show players the shape or size of any of the mist-filled hallways or tell them what direction they're traveling. When the
characters emerge in different rooms of the maze or gaps in the mist, describe areas in terms of "left" or "right" rather than cardinal directions.
The contents of the areas between the mists are detailed below.
P14a. A leather sack containing 102 gp lies against one wall of this corridor.
P14b. A +1 Warhammer lies near a heavy plank door in this clear stretch of corridor.
P14c. A tiny ring made of fine silver lies on the floor in the center of this corridor. The ring is a cursed Ring of Feather Falling. Attuning to the ring extends its curse to the wearer, who suffers the following effect:
Curse of Ill Temper. You are overcome with an urge to disagree with others' actions, ideas, and opinions.
While cursed in this way, the wearer is unwilling to part with the ring. A Remove Curse spell or similar magic breaks the curse.
P14d. Characters who have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 15 or higher detect a cool, fresh breeze from the east.
P14e. The words "Knock First" have been carved in Common into a heavy plank door. The bandits in the room beyond (see area P16) wrote this to try to dupe intruders into announcing their presence.
P14f. A cool, fresh breeze flows out from under the door, and a character listening at the door hears tumbling torrents of water.
P14g. Lying on the floor is the skeleton of a person who died while pulling a cart loaded with three chests stacked atop each other. Characters who have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 15 or higher detect the stench of rotten flesh from the north.
If the top chest is opened, it sprays poisoned darts in all directions. Each creature within 10 feet of the chest must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2 (1d4) piercing damage and 28 (8d6) poison damage and has the poisoned condition for 1 hour. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage only.

## P15: Grieving Elves

Humanoid bones litter the floor of this room, along with the tattered remnants of adventurers' clothing. Five elves dressed in similar attire kneel over the bones, speaking solemn prayers in mourning.

The "elves" are five doppelgangers that devoured a group of adventurers in this room four days ago; like the characters, those adventurers sought to break the pharaoh's curse. The doppelgangers then took on the adventurers' appearances.
The doppelgangers play the role of grieving elves who have just found the bones of their long-lost kin, reading the characters' thoughts to gain their pity and trust. The doppelgangers claim to know the trick to solving the maze: send two people ahead through the mists with a rope for the others to follow. They gladly volunteer to send one of their own as a guide along with one of the characters.
The doppelgangers aim to isolate the characters, slowly assuming their identities until none remain.

## P16: KNOCK, KNOCK

A few cots lie scattered around this room, as well as a few packs of supplies. Several humans dressed in dirty adventuring gear and green bandannas rest here.

Seven human bandits camp in this room. They are led by Cateline and Imbert (chaotic neutral, human bandit captains). The bandits are part of a thieving troupe called the Hands of Plenty. Dirty, sweaty, and tired, the bandits are initially indifferent toward the characters. If the characters knocked on the door before entering, the bandits have their weapons at the ready. Otherwise, they are arguing loudly.
Parleying with the Bandits. If the characters don't attack, the bandits are relieved to see them. The Hands of Plenty came to this pyramid days ago,
intending to raid it for treasure, but they quickly became lost. Now they just want to find their way out. None of the bandits have encountered the ghost of Amun Sa-they don't even know who he is.
Tired of wandering the pyramid, Cateline and Imbert grudgingly suggest a temporary alliance between the characters and the Hands of Plenty. If the characters agree, the Hands of Plenty accompany the characters and fight alongside them. However, if any of the bandits come across treasure worth 100 gp or more, their greed overwhelms them, and they attack the characters to claim the treasure for themselves.
Treasure. Cateline and Imbert each carry 40 gp . The other seven bandits each carry 10 gp .

## P17: RUG ROOM

An oversized chest sits atop a beautiful rug in this dome-ceilinged room. The rug beneath the chest is a rug of smothering.
If the chest or the rug is disturbed, the rug slips from beneath the chest and attacks. At the same time, the chest opens to reveal three more rugs of smothering that unfurl themselves and join the fight. Apart from these rugs, the chest is empty.

## P18: Well of Questions

A sphinx lounges on a wide platform at the far end of this chamber, her wings folded neatly at her side. Her tail flicks back and forth as she stares at you intently.
Water surges from a well in the middle of the room, flowing into a trough on the floor, across the room, and into to an opening below the sphinx's platform.

A gynosphinx named Senenura resides in this room. Initially indifferent to the characters, she asks them what they are doing here, then she makes them an offer. If the characters can answer a riddle, Senenura promises to answer one question they have about the tomb. She warns, however, that if the characters don't answer correctly, she will eat them. The characters need to accept or decline the offer before knowing the riddle.
Sphinx's Riddle. Senenura's riddle is as follows:
"Too much, and you wither; too little, and you shiver. I'm slow in the summer, and hasty in winter. What am I?"

The answer is the sun.
Answered Correctly. If the characters answer the riddle correctly, Senenura keeps her promise to answer one question they have about the tomb.
