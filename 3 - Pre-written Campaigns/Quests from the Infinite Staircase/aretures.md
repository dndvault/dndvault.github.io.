# aretures

This appendix describes creatures that appear in the adventures, presenting them in alphabetical order. The introduction of the Monster Manual explains how to read a creature's stat block.

## Android

Androids are synthetic humanoids built to assist their creators with highly specialized tasks. They are designed to be compliant and typically have friendly demeanors.
Every android has one or more upgrades to help it excel at its intended functions, but all androids are capable of defending themselves with concentrated bolts of force up close or from a distance.
Despite an android's sophisticated construction, electrical surges can temporarily disrupt its finely tuned components. Similarly, damage to its core processing functions or long stretches of isolation can wear down an android's critical faculties, causing it to behave erratically.

Design Specialization. When the android is created, it gains one of six possible designs suited for its role (choose or roll a d6): 1, aerialist; 2, diplomat; 3, diver; 4, duelist; 5, medic; 6, sentry. This design determines certain traits in this stat block.
Lightning Overload. When the android takes lightning damage, it must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or have the stunned condition until the start of its next turn.

2/day each: Cure Wounds (as a 3rd-level spell; medic only), Identify, Tongues (diplomat only)

## REACTIONS

## BARKBURR

Barkburrs are animate, poisonous Plants that spontaneously grow from trees when a spark of nature's magic takes root in the wood. They appear as limpet-like knots of bark and wood indistinguishable from ordinary tree burls. Barkburrs often act in defense of a grove or forest.

Some barkburrs cling to the trees from which they sprouted, while others slowly wander until they encounter creatures that threaten the forest's natural order. When a barkburr identifies such a creature, the barkburr leaps at the invader and injects it with a poisonous sap that quickly and painfully transforms the creature into a tree.

False Appearance. If the barkburr is motionless at the start of combat, it has advantage on its initiative roll. Moreover, if a creature hasn't observed the barkburr move or act, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the barkburr is animate.
Springing Leap. With or without a running start, the barkburr's high jump is up to 15 feet, and its long jump is up to 30 feet. The barkburr's jumps can exceed its speed if its speed isn't 0 .

## Actions

Multiattack. The barkburr makes two Poison Barb attacks and uses Lignify if able.
Poison Barb. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft ., one creature. Hit: $5(1 d 4+3)$ piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage, and the barkburr attaches to the target. While the barkburr is attached, it can't make Poison Barb attacks, and the target has the restrained condition as its body begins to transform into wood.
An attached barkburr can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement on its turn. A creature that can reach the barkburr, including the target, can use its action to detach the barkburr by making a successful DC 13 Strength (Athletics) check.
Lignify. The barkburr targets the creature it is attached to, and the target must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target has the petrified condition until freed by the Greater Restoration spell or another effect, except it turns into a tree instead of stone. Any equipment the target is wearing or carrying is absorbed into the tree's bark.

## Derro

Derro are Underdark dwellers of dubious origin. According to the histories of some duergar, derro are descended from a community of dwarves that was left behind when the others escaped the rule of mind flayers.

## DRELNZA

Drelnza is the vampire daughter of Iggwilv. She is the Witch Queen's greatest treasure, an immortal warrior who guards some of her mother's most precious belongings decades after the archmage's mysterious departure. The identity of Drelnza's father is unknown even to her.
Drelnza slumbers deep in the Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth, rising to dispatch those few who make it to Iggwilv's hoard. As a consequence of Drelnza's prolonged rest, she has yet to regain some of her vampiric powers.
In the years before Iggwilv's disappearance, Drelnza acted as general to a battalion of demons bound to serve the Witch Queen. Armed with her sentient longsword, Heretic (see appendix A), Drelnza terrorized the people of Perrenland.

While charmed in this way, the target regards Drelnza as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. The target isn't under Drelnza's control, but it takes her requests and actions in the most favorable way.
Each time Drelnza or her allies do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until Drelnza is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect.

## ReACTIONS

Drelnza can take up to three reactions per round but only one per turn.
Move. Immediately after a creature Drelnza can see ends its turn, Drelnza moves up to her speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
Parry. Drelnza adds 5 to her AC against one melee attack that would hit her. To do so, she must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.

## Froghemoth Elder

Froghemoths are massive amphibious predators with starry origins. A froghemoth has four tentacles, a rubbery hide, a long prehensile tongue, and three bulbous eyes branching from an extendable stalk.
Though most froghemoths lurk in swamps, those raised in unnatural environs-as well as those that dine on smaller, weaker hatchlings-are unmatched in strength and hunger. These ancient specimens, known as froghemoth elders, possess alien abilities and warp the ecosystems in which they dwell.
To learn more about froghemoths, see Monsters of the Multiverse.

## A Froghemoth Elder's Lair

Froghemoth elders lair in unnatural ecosystems that facilitate their growth, such as wrecked spaceships, primordial bogs, and radioactive pools.

Hypnotic Visions. One creature of the froghemoth's choice within 60 feet of it must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target is mesmerized by otherworldly visions and has the charmed condition until the end of the target's next turn. While charmed in this way, the target has the incapacitated condition, and its speed is 0 .

## Regional Effects

The region within 1 mile of a froghemoth elder's lair is altered by the froghemoth's unearthly presence, creating one or more of the following effects:
Alien Flora. Strange, invasive plants with bright colors and odd patterns sprout up around the lair. Mutations. Wildlife encountered near the lair often sport mutations, such as extra limbs or eyes, glowing secretions, or vestigial tentacles.
If the froghemoth elder dies, these effects fade over the course of 1 d 10 days.

The froghemoth's gullet can hold up to three creatures at a time. If the froghemoth takes 25 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the froghemoth must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, each of which lands in a space within 10 feet of the froghemoth and has the prone condition. If the froghemoth dies, any swallowed creatures are no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 10 feet of movement, exiting with the prone condition.
Tentacle. Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 20 ft ., one target. Hit: $20(3 \mathrm{~d} 8+7)$ bludgeoning damage, and the target has the grappled condition (escape DC 20). Until this grapple ends, the froghemoth can't use this tentacle on another target. The froghemoth has four tentacles.
Tongue. The froghemoth targets one Large or smaller creature that it can see within 25 feet of it. The target must make a DC 20 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target is pulled into an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the froghemoth.

## Reactions

The froghemoth can take up to three reactions per round but only one per turn.
Alien Gaze. When a creature the froghemoth can see damages the froghemoth, the froghemoth swivels its eyestalk toward the creature and pierces the creature's mind with its otherworldly gaze. That creature must make a DC 18 Intelligence saving throw, taking 7 (2d6) psychic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.
Leap. Immediately after a creature the froghemoth can see ends its turn, the froghemoth jumps up to half its speed. Each creature within 5 feet of the froghemoth when it lands must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or have the prone condition.

## The Gardener

The Gardener is an archfey who adores the splendor of nature, the joy of song, and the glow of shared merriment. This ancient being once wandered the Feywild and worlds of the Material Plane until two dear friends created a wondrous garden and asked the Gardener to tend to it. The Gardener agreed to the request, then pulled the garden from the Material Plane and transformed it into a Domain of Delight-a region of the Feywild that bows to an archfey's will. This place became known as the Eternal Garden.

The Gardener abhors bloodshed and avoids killing even those who threaten the garden, preferring to entangle them in vines and pacify them with tranquilizing breaths of flowery mist.

Vine Wall. A wall of grasping vines appears on the ground within 120 feet of the Gardener. The wall is up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick, and it blocks line of sight. When the wall appears, each creature in its area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or have the grappled condition (escape DC 15). A creature must make this saving throw when it starts its turn inside the wall or when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn. The wall's area is difficult terrain for a creature that isn't grappled.

## Gibberling

A single gibberling is little more than a nuisance-a babbling, hairy creature that darts about, attacking whatever it can find. Unfortunately, gibberlings are rarely encountered alone. They rampage in dense swarms, crawling and leaping over each other to rip, shred, and devour everything in their path.
Gibberlings are named for their incoherent chattering. Loud and shrill, their exasperating nonsense distracts even the most focused creatures. Gibberling swarms are heard long before they are seen.
The first gibberlings were spawned in the jungles of the Gaping Maw, a layer of the Abyss ruled by the demon lord Demogorgon. The Prince of Demons' influence instilled in gibberlings a hive-mind-like nature, protecting them from magical compulsions. However, unlike most demons, gibberlings share a strong aversion to fire.
On the Material Plane, gibberlings tend to dwell in dense forests or the Underdark.

The Guardians of Gorm are stalwart Cynidiceans who worship Gorm, an ancient god of justice, storms, and war. Members of the order wear brass masks bearing the face of their god, who is depicted as a long-haired, bearded man with a stern gaze. Each fully initiated guardian has a small blue lightning bolt tattooed on their right shoulder.

Guardians follow a strict code of decorum that values bravery, honesty, and justice tempered with mercy. Still, they are quick to chastise blasphemers, criminals, and cultists who oppose their cause, buffeting these foes with their shocking implements.

## Horrid Plant

Horrid plants are a family of carnivorous vegetation found in bogs, damp heaths, jungles, and swamps. Some botanists theorize these plants are an invasive species from a faraway world. When still, horrid plants resemble ordinary (if vibrant) foliage.

## Horrid Plant Varieties

The most infamous varieties of horrid plant are dew drinkers, purple blossoms, and snapper saws.

## Dew Drinker

Dew drinkers resemble large cabbage plants until they unfurl their long, hair-tipped tendrils. Dew drinkers use these tendrils to drain the moisture and life force from their prey.

## Purple Blossom

The purple blossom is a treelike plant with cupshaped purple flowers. Tubules within the plant's branches connect the flowers to reserves of acidic sap in the plant's trunk. Purple blossoms squirt this sap at prey through the flowers' pistils.

## Snapper Saw

Snapper saws resemble ordinary bushes and bear fragrant white berries during temperate seasons. Between encounters, the plant buries its weaponswide, razor-sharp outer leaves-in the loose dirt around itself to catch unsuspecting prey off guard.

Large Plant, Unaligned

Horrid Plant Varieties. A horrid plant comes in one of three varieties (choose or roll a d6): 1-2, dew drinker; 3-4, purple blossom; or 5-6, snapper saw. This form determines certain traits in this stat block.
False Appearance. If the horrid plant is motionless at the start of combat, it has advantage on its initiative roll. Moreover, if a creature hasn't observed the horrid plant move or act, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence (Nature) check to discern that the horrid plant isn't an ordinary plant.

## Actions

Multiattack. The horrid plant makes two Tendril attacks.

Tendril. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 30 ft ., one target. Hit: 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Huge or smaller creature, it has the grappled condition (escape DC 14), and the horrid plant can pull the target up to 25 feet closer to itself. Until the grapple ends, the target has the restrained condition, and the horrid plant can't use the same tendril on another target. The horrid plant has two tendrils.

## Bonus Actions

Sap Squirt (Purple Blossom Only). The horrid plant targets one creature it can see within 15 feet of itself. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 28 (8d6) acid damage and become covered in acidic sap. This sap lasts for 1 minute or until a creature uses its action to scrape the sap off itself or another creature it can reach. A creature covered in sap takes 14 (4d6) acid damage at the start of each of its turns.
Spiked Leaves (Snapper Saw Only). Creatures within 10 feet of the horrid plant and not behind total cover must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) slashing damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.
Vampiric Tendril (Dew Drinker Only). One creature grappled by the horrid plant must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken, and the horrid plant regains hit points equal to that amount. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0 .

Proficiency Bonus +2
Industrious. The leprechaun is proficient with all artisan's tools and adds double its proficiency bonus to ability checks made with them.

Reluctant Refusal. When a creature offers the leprechaun the chance to partake in merriment or revelry such as a song, a dance, or a good meal, the leprechaun must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have the charmed condition for 24 hours. While charmed in this way, the leprechaun partakes of the offering, treats the creature as a trusted friend, and seeks to defend it from harm. The charmed condition ends if the creature or any of its allies damage the leprechaun, force the leprechaun to make a saving throw, or steal from the leprechaun.

## Actions

Multiattack. The leprechaun makes two Cobbler's Hammer attacks and can use Spellcasting.
Cobbler's Hammer. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft ., one target. Hit: $6(1 \mathrm{~d} 6+3)$ bludgeoning damage plus 13 (3d8) force damage. If the target is a creature, its speed is halved until the start of the leprechaun's next turn.
Gift of Luck (1/Day). The leprechaun touches a creature and magically gifts the target a measure of luck. The creature gains the leprechaun's Astonishing Luck reaction. The creature can use the reaction three times, after which this gift goes away. The leprechaun can revoke this gift from a creature at any time (no action required). A creature can benefit from only one leprechaun's Gift of Luck at a time.
Spellcasting. The leprechaun casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 14):
At will: Mending (as an action), Prestidigitation 2/day each: Invisibility, Phantasmal Force 1/day each: Fabricate (as an action), Mislead

## BONUS Actions

Cunning Trick. The leprechaun takes the Disengage or Hide action or makes a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check.

## ReACTIONS

Astonishing Luck. When the leprechaun fails an ability check, an attack roll, or a saving throw, it can roll a new d20 and choose which roll to use, potentially turning the failure into a success.

## LEPRECHAUN

Leprechauns are manifestations of the Feywild rules of hospitality and reciprocity. These rules infuse leprechauns with a deep connection to fixing and making things. Industrious and proud, leprechauns channel this creative energy into their tools, using them to quickly mend damaged objects, craft new ones from raw materials, and mold ideas into vivid illusions.
A leprechaun's adherence to Feywild rules affords it tremendous luck, but this fortune comes at a cost. These same magical strictures compel leprechauns to use their powers on behalf of those who offer them gifts. Leprechauns despise greed and are spiteful toward anyone who makes demands without first offering a gift or, worse, anyone who tries to steal from them. They delight in pranking such foolish creatures or pilfering from them in return.
Leprechauns take pride in their appearances, dressing in dapper outfits that typically feature red fabrics, gleaming belts and buckles, and natural woodland accouterments. These fashions compliment their bright green skin, exuberant hair, and upbeat demeanors.

## Mages of Usamigaras

The Mages of Usamigaras are Cynidicean spellcasters who worship Usamigaras, a god of magic, messengers, and lies. They hide their identities and intentions behind silver masks depicting the face of their god.
Secrecy is key among the Mages of Usamigaras. Members whisper in the presence of outsiders and pepper their speech with lies, even obvious ones. Such behavior isn't rude among members, who view deceit as worthy of celebration, not chastisement.
