# Robots

Robots are Constructs created for heavy labor, menial tasks, or routine security. Despite robots' hardy construction, their circuitry is prone to overload if exposed to strong electrical currents.
A robot has a pair of small appendages for fine motor control and object manipulation, as well as two larger appendages specialized for its role. Robots are programmed with intelligence, understanding, and usually loyalty to their creators. Despite that, long-operating robots sometimes develop their own personalities and ideas.
Robots that endure long stretches of isolation, mistreatment, or neglect are prone to malfunctions. Some robots become despondent or cruel, while others obsessively repeat their last directive or adopt new, peculiar purposes of their own.

## Combat Robot

Combat robots are designed for security or military action. They make able sentries and are usually programmed to take intruders prisoner before resorting to lethal force. Combat robots signal their pursuit with built-in sirens and flashing lights, warning nearby creatures of their imminent arrival with an intimidating display.
Combat robots display a wide range of voices. Some units are clearly designed to intimidate, while others offer canned, upbeat platitudes in pleasant tones even while subduing opponents.

## Worker Robot

Worker robots are built for physical labor such as hauling cargo, construction, and maintenance, though some worker robots fill public-facing service roles. Antigravity technology and built-in tractor beams allow worker robots to effortlessly lift cargo and other heavy objects with their mechanical tentacles, which double as weapons if the robots are threatened or drafted for security purposes.
A worker robot's voice is often utilitarian, programmed to use simple phrases without embellishment. Worker robots designed to be in public viewsuch as units that carry out deliveries, repairs, or transportation-have voices that more closely mimic those of their creators. These robots employ mollifying phrases or make shallow but pleasant small talk.

## SION

Sion is the most trusted servant of Piyarz, a traitorous sage in the Tower of the Heavens. Originally one of the tower's stewards, Sion displayed an innate talent for magic. Piyarz encouraged Sion to develop his arcane powers in secret, and in time Sion became a skilled shadow sorcerer. He kept his umbral abilities hidden from the tower's other residents. Even so, they all noticed his fervent devotion to Piyarz and, ironically, refer to him in private as "Piyarz's shadow."

Sion's sorcery allows him to step in and out of shadows and create shadowy duplicates of himself. He can even exercise limited control over others' shadows, causing the shadows to grasp their hosts and pin them in place. Wherever Sion goes, he's accompanied by his two pets, a ferocious hound and an oversized raven that help Sion track down his enemies. Spun by Sion from pure shadow, both creatures use the shadow stat block, but the raven has a flying speed of 40 feet.

## Tower Stewards

For centuries, the Tower of the Heavens has been stewarded by dutiful folk who practice two distinct traditions.

## Tower Hand

Tower hands belong to the Order of the Night Sky, an ancient society of martial artists who protect the sages of the Tower of the Heavens. They rarely speak and carry few worldly possessions.

## Tower Sage

Tower sages are mages who study astrology and support the leader of the Tower of the Heavens, the elder sage, in divining the future. When tower sages are initiated, their arms are tattooed with magical ink that designates their status in the hierarchy. Pupil sages have simple designs patterned after individual stars and minor constellations, while the elder sage's arms depict a plethora of constellations, moons, and suns. When the elder sage dies, the arm tattoos of the elder's chosen successor magically shift into the patterns of an elder sage.
Tower sages are the only folk capable of reading the Books of Prophecy, an ancient set of tomes that hint at future events of grand significance.

## VEGEPYGMIES

Also called mold folk, vegepygmies are fungal creatures that spring forth from the body of a Humanoid or Giant killed by russet mold, a poisonous fungus rumored to have originated from beyond the stars.

Vegepygmies gather in small bands, communicating with a combination of gestures, hisses, and rhythmic taps. While vegepygmies can sustain themselves by absorbing nutrients from soil and other organic matter, they prefer a carnivorous diet achieved through hunting and scavenging. Vegepygmies can live indefinitely so long as the climate remains hospitable to their fungal bodies.

To learn more about vegepygmies, see Monsters of the Multiverse.

## VEGEPYGMY MOLDMAKER

The oldest vegepygmies in a colony sometimes achieve control over the growth and propagation of the mold that bore them. These elders, known as moldmakers, can envelop foes in stifling layers of mold. Moldmakers often wear pauldrons made of lichen to denote their status.

## Wolf-in-Sheep's-Clothing

A wolf-in-sheep's-clothing is a predatory plant that resembles a tree stump. It hides in areas of thick vegetation and has a bark-like hide, eyestalks like vines or withered flowers, rootlike tentacles, and a fleshy growth atop its body that it uses to lure prey toward its fang-filled maw.
Wolves-in-sheep's-clothing can reshape their lures to mimic the appearance of various small, often adorable creatures to entice their prey. The Lure Forms table suggests some forms the lure might take.

## Lure Forms

## ZargON THE Returner

Zargon the Returner is an elder evil-an undying abomination from eons past with an insatiable appetite. A tentacled, slime-covered horror with a cyclopic red eye and an indestructible horn, Zargon corrupts creatures it doesn't devour, transforming its victims into amorphous servants.
No one knows Zargon's true origin. The creature was one of the first inhabitants of the Nine Hells, predating even the arrival of Asmodeus, the plane's foremost ruler. Long-lived devils and occult sages theorize Zargon and its kind were invaders from another plane-or another reality entirely.
When Asmodeus ascended the infernal hierarchy, he and his legions wiped out most of the plane's earlier inhabitants, but Zargon proved beyond even Asmodeus' might. No matter what blistering wrath Asmodeus brought to bear on Zargon, the aberration continually re-formed from its horn. Finally, Asmodeus cast Zargon's horn from the Nine Hells in disgust, banishing the elder evil to the Material Plane. The horn was driven deep into the earth where it fell, entombing Zargon below.
Eventually a civilization arose above Zargon's prison. The elder evil whispered through dreams and nightmares to the people of Cynidicea, the
realm's capital, until one day, a crew of Cynidiceans accidentally dug through to the Returner's prison. Zargon emerged, devouring many of the city's inhabitants and drowning many more in its slime. The city soon fell. Those who survived Zargon's rampage turned to it in worship, sacrificing their own to appease their so-called god. Appeased by these living offerings, Zargon returned to the tunnels beneath Cynidicea, where its cult grew.

## ZargON'S LAIR

Zargon's lair is a slimy cavern beneath the lost city of Cynidicea. The elder evil lurks in the depths, feasting on sacrifices cast down by its worshipers.

## Lair Actions

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Zargon can take one of the following lair actions; it can't take the same lair action two rounds in a row:
Dissolution. Zargon dissolves into a glob of slime, seeps to an unoccupied space anywhere in the lair without provoking opportunity attacks, then re-forms.
Spell Breaker. Zargon targets up to two creatures it can see within the lair. All spells of 5th level or lower affecting the targets end.

---

Sucking Slime. Zargon creates a 20 -foot-radius puddle of slime on the ground centered on a point within the lair. The slime is difficult terrain, and each creature in that area when the slime appears has the grappled condition (escape DC 15). Aberrations and Oozes are unaffected by the slime. The slime lasts until Zargon dies or until it uses this lair action again.

## Regional Effects

The region containing Zargon's lair is warped by Zargon's unnatural presence, creating one or more of the following effects:

Shrouded Being. Zargon can't be targeted by divination magic or perceived through magical scrying sensors.
Slimy Demise. When Zargon dies, its body dissolves into foul slime, leaving only its horn behind. Zargon re-forms in 1d10 days, regrowing from the horn. The horn is immune to all damage and can be destroyed only by submerging it in a cleansing waterfall on one of the Upper Planes for 101 days. While the horn is submerged in this way, Zargon doesn't re-form, and the horn slowly dissolves, sending corrupting slime downriver that permanently fouls the water for 10 miles from the place where the horn dissolved. The fouled water is unfit to drink, chokes aquatic wildlife, and withers plants.

## Actions

Multiattack. Zargon makes two Barbed Tentacle attacks, one Bite attack, and one Gore attack.
Barbed Tentacle. Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 20 ft ., one target. Hit: $15(2 \mathrm{~d} 8+6)$ piercing damage. If the target is a

Arcane Enervation. Enemies of Zargon within 1 mile of the lair have disadvantage on saving throws made to maintain concentration.
Corrupted Water. Rain and water sources within 1 mile of the lair are tainted. A creature that drinks the water must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the poisoned condition until it finishes a long rest.
Eerie Weather. The area within 10 miles of the lair experiences strange weather patterns that defy the region's typical climate.
If Zargon dies, these effects fade over the course of 1 d 10 days.

Large or smaller creature, it has the grappled condition (escape DC 20), and Zargon can pull the creature up to 20 feet straight toward itself. Zargon has six tentacles, each of which can grapple one creature. Zargon can move at its full speed while dragging creatures it is grappling.
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 5 ft ., one target. Hit: $19(2 \mathrm{~d} 12+6)$ piercing damage plus $7(2 \mathrm{~d} 6)$ acid damage.
Gore. Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 10 ft ., one target. Hit: $15(2 \mathrm{~d} 8+6)$ force damage, and a 10 -foot-radius invisible sphere of antimagic, like that created by an Antimagic Field spell, surrounds the target. The sphere is centered on the target, moves with the target, and lasts until the end of Zargon's next turn.
Slime Wave (Recharge 5-6). Zargon spews slime in a 60 -foot cone. Each creature in that area that isn't an Aberration or Ooze must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes $38(7 \mathrm{~d} 10)$ acid damage and has the poisoned condition for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage only. A poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
A creature reduced to 0 hit points by the acid damage dies and dissolves into a puddle of slime that rises as a gibbering mouther at the start of Zargon's next turn. The creature obeys Zargon's commands and takes its turn immediately after Zargon's. Only a Wish spell can reverse this transformation and restore the creature to life.

## Reactions

Zargon can take up to three reactions per round but only one per turn.
Defiant Essence. When a creature casts a spell that targets Zargon or would deal damage to it, Zargon attempts to absorb the magic into its horn. The creature must make a DC 19 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 6 (1d12) force damage, and the spell it cast fails and is wasted.
Slime Spray. When a creature ends its turn within 30 feet of Zargon, Zargon sprays toxic slime at the creature. The target must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw (with disadvantage if it has the poisoned condition). On a failed save, the creature takes 7 (2d6) poison damage. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.
