# Bevand the (rustal (ave

HE CITY OF SYbAR ON THE SMALL ISLAND OF Sybarate serves as a hub for fishing and trade. Its people are industrious and friendly, and they eagerly share stories with visitors. One popular tale surrounds the Eternal Garden, a magical paradise created by two lovers ages ago. Legend states the entrance to the garden lies deep within a crystal cave that whispers secrets of the future to those brave or foolish enough to enter. More recently, two young paramours-one of whom is the daughter of the island's governor-fled their feuding families in search of the fabled utopia.
The Eternal Garden is real. Past the dangers of the cave, the garden is tucked away in the Feywild, far from the pressures of the world. Whimsical Fey, talking animals, and a benevolent archfey ruler await visitors to the garden. So does the Fountain All Heal, a miraculous fountain whose waters cure most ailments but also enchant those who drink from it, lulling imbibers into a comfort that makes them never want to leave. None of the garden's denizens are inherently malicious, but they defend their own. Wits, clever words, and compassion are more effective weapons here than swords or spells.
The paramours' families, once long-standing rivals, have put aside their enmity in hopes that when the missing lovers are found, they will then be willing to come home. It's been two years since the couple's disappearance, but neither family has abandoned hope. The families turn to adventurers to rescue their missing loved ones.
"Beyond the Crystal Cave" is designed for four to six 6th-level characters.

## BACKGROUND

Long ago, an elf archdruid named Caerwyn retired to Sybarate with her soulmate, a human archmage named Porphura. There on Caerwyn's estates, they laid out and built a sprawling garden. It was an earthly paradise, serving both as a symbol of their enduring love and an idyllic retreat.
Caerwyn and Porphura stocked their garden with the loveliest of plants and encouraged gentle forest creatures to make it their home. Porphura used magic to extend her life so she could remain with Caerwyn throughout the elf's longer life span.

A DOOR TO THE ETERNAL GARDEN
To protect their paradise, the lovers struck a bargain with an old friend, an archfey known as the Gardener. Together the three of them drew the garden into the Feywild, where the Gardener became its caretaker. The domain maintained a connection to the Material Plane through a fey crossing in a magical cave on Sybarate, the Cave of Echoes.
When Caerwyn's life reached its inevitable end, Porphura worked one last undertaking. She raised a tomb inside their home and sealed off the palace from the rest of the garden, so the pair could rest undisturbed together forever. Porphura then laid down beside Caerwyn for the last time and let the magic that sustained her own life finally unravel.

## Using the Infinite Staircase

If you're using Nafas as a patron, he summons the characters to the Censer of Dreams (detailed in chapter 1), where he recounts the following wish:
"Two families, their histories and hands stained with hate and blood, now raise their voices as one in the wake of true love lost. Heed their plea and carry their wandering hearts home."

Nafas then teleports the characters to a door that leads to Sybar. After the adventure, the characters can return to the staircase through the same portal.

---

## Adventure Hooks

If you're not using Nafas as a group patron, consider the following ways to involve the characters in the adventure:

From the Sea. The characters arrive on a ship or wash ashore from a shipwreck. They learn the governor of Sybar is seeking adventurers to rescue her missing daughter.
Missing Friends. One or more characters are old friends of one or both of the missing lovers, Juliana and Orlando. The governor sends for the characters, desperate for their help after a string of failed rescue attempts.

## Setting the Adventure

On the world of Oerth in the Greyhawk campaign setting, the island of Sybarate is located in the mouth of Jeklea Bay, about a mile south of Fairwind Isle.
If you'd like to place the adventure in another campaign setting, consider the following suggestions:
Dragonlance. On the world of Krynn, Juliana and Orlando might be from rival kingdoms that don't typically get along, such as Qualinesti and Silvanesti. Amid the smoldering ashes of war, the story of the missing lovers can remind the heroes what they fight for and warn of the divisions that weaken the free peoples of Ansalon.
Eberron. The cave is a manifest zone of Thelanis, the Faerie Court, and the Eternal Garden resides on that plane. Juliana and Orlando are scions of rival Dragonmarked houses, fleeing prohibition against their relationship.
Theros. The Cave of Echoes is sacred to Karametra, a god of harvests who shepherds the mortal need for love, security, and belonging. She cradles the Eternal Garden in the godly realm of Nyx, and the native creatures that dwell there are Nyxborn.

## Adventure Summary

"Beyond the Crystal Cave" begins when characters approach the governor of Sybarate, who is offering a small fortune for an urgent rescue mission. The characters learn the tale of Caerwyn and Porphura's garden, where two new lovers, Juliana and Orlando, have fled to escape their feuding families. Only one path leads into the hidden refuge: a cave with a mystical reputation. After besting the cave's guardians, the characters find a waterfall frozen in time and unravel its mysteries to discover a fey crossing into the Eternal Garden in the Feywild.
As the characters explore the garden, they likely meet the Gardener, the archfey who rules the domain; this is especially likely if they clash with any denizens of the garden, which abounds with eccentric Fey creatures. Various beings can offer cryptic clues to the missing lovers' whereabouts in a hidden palace within the garden. While in the garden, the characters might learn of a fountain that cures almost any ailment but enchants those who drink it to want to remain in the garden forever.
The adventure concludes when the characters free Juliana and Orlando from the fountain's enchantment and convince them that their families are no longer enemies. When they all arrive back on the Material Plane, they might discover they've been gone longer than they realized, thanks to the divergent flow of time within the garden.

## Character Advancement

If you want to use story-based level advancement, the characters receive experience points for achieving milestones rather than defeating monsters.
When the characters leave the garden, with or without Juliana and Orlando, everyone in the party gains 1 level. If you follow this method, the characters should reach 7 th level by the adventure's conclusion.

## About the Original

Published in 1983, Beyond the Crystal Cave is the first adventure in the series of adventures produced by TSR UK. The story draws inspiration from the star-crossed lovers in Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. It was a departure from the more expected adventure design of the time in that violent solutions to problems aren't an automatic path to victory-inquisitive minds and compassionate hearts carry the heroes further than strength of arms.

This updated version of the adventure reimagines Caerwyn and Porphura's-originally Porpherio's-garden as the Eternal Garden, a domain in the Feywild, and the Green Man as the Gardener, the benevolent archfey who rules it.

## SYbAR

A small fishing and port city, Sybar is the capital of Sybarate and the island's center of administration and trade. The governor's mansion and various executive offices are situated here, along with a temple to the sea god Procan.
Sybar is situated on the north coast of the island. Fishing and farming villages dot the remainder of Sybarate, which is lush with vineyards; vegetable farms; and extensive olive, lemon, and orange orchards. The people of the island are orderly and law abiding, but many of the old families hold longstanding grudges against one another.
Merchants and artisans are plentiful in Sybar, as are sailors and traders in the port. The locals tend to be talkative over meals, stiff drinks, or hot beverages on chilly evenings. If the characters mingle with the people of Sybar, residents can relate the story of the Eternal Garden (as presented in this adventure's background) or any of the rumors in the Sybar Rumors table, only some of which are true.

## Sybar Rumors

d8 Rumor
1 There is a magical fountain in the Eternal Garden that grants eternal youth. (False)
2 It is always summer within the Eternal Garden. (True)
3 Fire, both natural and magical, won't burn within the garden. (False)
4 Sometimes people find their way into the garden, but most have little or no memory of it when they find their way out again. (True)
5 The archmage Porphura isn't dead at all. She lives still as a lich who rules the island in secret. (False)
6 Singing sea chanteys charms creatures in the garden. (True only for leprechauns; see appendix B)
7 Eating or drinking the garden's bounty traps a person there forever. (Partially true; refers to the Fountain All Heal)
8 There is a cave near the garden in which wishes are granted. (True; refers to the Cave of Echoes)

## Meeting the Governor

Governor Isabela Folcarae (lawful good, human bandit captain) receives the characters shortly after they call at her mansion. Read or paraphrase the following text to begin the adventure:

You stand in a tastefully appointed study with nautical decor. The governor, an human woman with iron-gray hair, stares pensively into the fireplace. After a polite offer of refreshment, she gets down to business.
![img-34.jpeg](Quests%20from%20the%20Infinite%20Staircase_img-34.jpeg)

She speaks in a solemn voice. "My daughter Juliana, and Orlando, son of the prominent Monego family, have been missing for two years, but we have never given up hope that they still live. After several failed expeditions and countless nights of worry, I believe I finally know where they've gone. If you bring them home safely, I will reward you handsomely."

The governor can offer the following information:

- Juliana and Orlando eloped when their feuding families forbade their relationship.
- The couple fled south and disappeared into the Cave of Echoes, a cavern steeped in local legends of oracular voices and granted wishes.
- In their shared grief, the families have settled their differences and resolved to do all in their power to rescue the missing couple.
- The families have sent numerous adventurers in search of the couple; the few that returned did so empty-handed.
Governor Folcarae can also relate the legend of the Eternal Garden, but she doesn't know details about its inhabitants or dangers-she doubts it even exists. In exchange for Juliana and Orlando's safe return, she promises a reward of $5,000 \mathrm{gp}$.

## Cave of Echoes

The Cave of Echoes is a day's ride south of Sybar. Originally, the cave was the underground course of a river that flowed from a lake in the Eternal Garden before the garden was drawn into the Feywild. The caverns were worn smooth by the water that once rushed through them.
The cave entrance yawns in the southwest side of the small hill where the garden once stood. A fey crossing in the Cave of Echoes links it to the Eternal Garden and saturates the caverns with fey magic. The hilltop is now barren, and the river, which still flows through the portal, has been reduced to a mere trickle. The meager stream ends at a muddy chamber in the cave, depositing what little magic it still contains there.
Locals know of the Cave of Echoes, and many believe a specific chamber has oracular powers. Most Sybarate citizens either have sought answers from the cavern or know someone who did. The magic of the Feywild whispers into the cavern, offering aid to those of good heart and true need, as it did with Juliana and Orlando when it whisked them away to the garden. Few venture beyond this chamber, wary of dangers that lurk deeper within the cave.

## Cave of Echoes Features

Unless otherwise noted, the Cave of Echoes has the following features:
Ceilings. Ceilings in chambers are 20 feet high and bristle with stalactites.
Echoes. Sounds echo strangely throughout the cave, distorting into fleeting whispers.
Lighting. The cave isn't illuminated. The current occupants rely on darkvision to see. Area descriptions assume the characters have a light source or other means of seeing in the dark.
Tunnels. The tunnels connecting caverns are roughly round and 10 feet in diameter.

## Cave of Echoes Locations

The following locations are keyed to map 4.1.

## Cl: Empty Cavern

This vaulted cavern is forty feet across and twenty-five feet high in the center. The ground is flat and scuffed with muddy tracks, and the walls are marked with initials and names carved into the stone. Tunnels lead deeper into darkness to the east and the south.

The entrance cavern is empty save for the tracks of Humanoid entrants, most of whom stopped here before turning back. A few follow the tunnel to the south.

Writing on the Walls. Names and initials are inscribed on the walls. Some are the results of dares or tests of bravery; others were left by those marking their visit to the Cavern of Echoes (area C2). Older markings left in ink, charcoal, or paint are faded and illegible. A character who leaves their name or initials in the cave sometimes hears their name whispered among the echoes of the cave.
Characters who examine the walls find the initials " $\mathrm{C}+\mathrm{P}$ " carved into the stone and circumscribed by a heart. A character who studies the wall and succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence (Arcana) check determines these initials weren't carved by tools, but rather were magically engraved into the stone. Caerwyn and Porphura marked the wall using the Stone Shape spell.

## C2: Cavern of Echoes

Even the smallest sounds echo in this round, fortyfoot-wide chamber. The walls and floor are glassy smooth and black, refracting light into rainbows beneath the stone. The ceiling vanishes into darkness high overhead. In the center of the floor, inlaid with white marble, is the word "Ask" in Common.

The ceiling in this oracular chamber is 80 feet high and smooth like the walls and floor.
Loud Echoes. Sounds in this area echo loudly. Noises louder than a typical conversation-such as shouting or playing an instrument-reverberate painfully. If this occurs, each creature in the chamber must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 13 (3d8) thunder damage and have the deafened condition for 1 minute. The echo then dissipates and doesn't compound.
Whispers of Fate. The magic of the Feywild whispers into the cavern, offering aid to those in true need and without selfish intent. When such a creature requests help in this area, the cavern can offer answers or intervene by duplicating any spell of 8 th level or lower (your choice, not the creature's). The most common assistance provided by the cave comes in the form of the Greater Restoration, Heal, and Plane Shift (to the Eternal Garden only) spells; when duplicating the effect of a spell, the cavern targets the creature that requested its aid.
A creature that asks a question here receives a truthful, albeit cryptic, answer in Common with clues to its goals. Those who can help themselves, such as the characters, receive only this benefit from the cavern. If the characters inquire about the whereabouts of Juliana and Orlando, disembodied voices tell them their quarry is just beyond the crystal cave (area C6). The cave's oracular power is similar to a Divination spell.
