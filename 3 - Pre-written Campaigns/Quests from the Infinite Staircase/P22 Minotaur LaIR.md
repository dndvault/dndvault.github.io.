# P22: Minotaur LaIR

The walls of this room are splattered with dried blood. There is a ten-foot-diameter hole in the ceiling. Piled beneath it is a large mound of straw.
Three hulking creatures with humanoid bodies, bulls' heads, and piercing red eyes pace around this room, snorting aggressively with axes in hand.

The three minotaurs in this room attack on sight. Summoned by the mage who created the maze, the minotaurs are Fiends instead of Monstrosities. They know nothing of Amun Sa and seek only to spill the blood of trespassers in the maze. The minotaurs are immune to the mists' disorienting effect.
Ceiling Shaft. The hole in the ceiling leads to a 30 -foot-long vertical shaft covered by a trapdoor in a temple on the pyramid's third floor (area P52).
Treasure. Scattered in the hay are $1,800 \mathrm{gp}$.

## P23: Darkness Room

Magical darkness fills this room. A Dispel Magic spell cast on the darkness dispels it, as does the Daylight spell.
A locked chest rests against the west wall. Two black puddings cling to the ceiling above it. The oozes drop from the ceiling to ambush any creature that approach the chest.
Treasure. The chest holds three identical bottles: two Potions of Healing and a Potion of Poison.

## P24: Robber Press

This room was designed to grind intruders to a pulp. It appears empty, except for a small leather knapsack that sits at the far end of the room.
Compacting Wall Trap. When a Small or larger creature ventures more than 10 feet into the room, the door slams shut and locks itself, and the walls to the east and west begin to close in. Roll initiative.

---

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), creatures between the walls take 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage and have the restrained condition as they're slowly crushed by the walls. The walls continue to compress for 3 rounds.
A creature within 5 feet of the door can try to open it by using its action to make a DC 20 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check with thieves' tools to bypass the lock or a DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check to force open the door.
A creature in the room can use its action to make a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check to hold the walls apart until the start of its next turn. On a successful check, creatures take no damage from the walls and don't have the restrained condition during that time.
After 3 rounds, the walls return to their initial positions, ending the restrained condition on creatures still between them. The door then unlocks.
Illusory Knapsack. The knapsack is an illusion to lure creatures into the room. A character who examines the knapsack can determine it's an illusion with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check or by physically interacting with it.

## P25: Suspiciously Empty Room

This large square room has a domed ceiling and is completely empty. There is nothing of note here.

## P26: Pole Forest

Like a forest of narrow wooden poles, dozens of long spears protrude from holes in the floor toward this room's domed ceiling, which is encircled by a narrow ledge. The skeleton of a dwarf in chain-mail is pinned to the ceiling. The dwarf's pack was ripped open by one of the spears, spilling a pile of jewels on the floor.

Characters can pass through the room by hacking a path through the spears. The spears are easily felled, but doing so is noisy. Roll on the Random Maze of Mist Encounters table (detailed earlier in this section) to determine what creatures arrive to investigate the noise.
Secret Door. A secret door atop this room's 30 -foot-high ledge leads to an observation dome on the third floor of the pyramid (area P53d).
Treasure. Spilled amid the poles are five jacinth gems worth 300 gp each.

## P27: FlamesKull Room

Three flameskulls fly in circles around this room, whose domed ceiling is encircled by a narrow ledge. The flameskulls attack intruders on sight.
Secret Door. A secret door atop this room's 30 -foot-high ledge leads to an observation dome on the third floor of the pyramid (area P53e).

## P28: Loose Ceiling

A cloaker camouflaged to match the stonework lies flush against the ceiling of this room, whose domed ceiling is encircled by a narrow ledge. The cloaker attacks the first creature that enters the chamber.
Secret Door. A secret door atop this room's 30 -foot-high ledge leads to an observation dome on the third floor of the pyramid (area P53f).

## Halls of the Upper Priesthood

The third floor of the pyramid was known as the Halls of the Upper Priesthood. All the Undead on this level were priests of Amun Sa until the former high priest, Nafik (see appendix B), corrupted their souls and cursed them with undeath.
For each hour the party spends on this floor, roll a d6. On a roll of 1 , an encounter occurs. To determine what the characters encounter, roll on the Random Upper Priesthood Encounters table, rerolling duplicates.
The following locations are keyed to map 5.3.

## Random Upper Priesthood Encounters

d4 Encounter
1 Eight giant spiders
2 Three carrion crawlers
3 Six ghasts
4 Three banshees

## P29: Waterway

If the party enters this area from the tunnel in the Well of Questions (area P18), read or paraphrase:

You surface in a tumbling, turbulent pool of water within a ten-foot-square shaft that ascends forty feet from the surface of the water. The air is damp, and the walls are covered with slimy green moss.

Dim light streams from an archway near the top of one side of the shaft. A narrow, roaring waterfall pours from the archway into the pool.

If the party enters this area from the hall (areas P30-P31), read or paraphrase the following text:

The corridor ends in an archway followed by a steep drop. The water falls over the edge into a murky pool at the bottom of a deep moss-covered shaft.

Handholds line the walls. Characters can climb this shaft without needing to make any checks.
Water of Athis. The waterway is filled with the water of Athis (see the "Pyramid Features" section).
