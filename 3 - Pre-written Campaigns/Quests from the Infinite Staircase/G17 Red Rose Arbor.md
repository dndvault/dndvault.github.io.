# G17: Red Rose Arbor

Aside from its position and the color of the rosesthe ones here are a deep, rich red-this arbor is identical to area G16.

## G18: Lake

A placid lake fed by a forest stream to the north reflects the colorful sky. Gossamer-winged dragonflies dance among the tall reeds and plants at the shore, and the lake's surface ripples with the splashes of playful otters. A small boat is tied to a stone jetty along the western shore.
A long, white stone building with a translucent roof and open archways rises from the center of the lake.

Two friendly giant otters (giant weasels with a swimming speed of 40 feet) frolic in this shallow lake, which slopes gently from the shore to a depth of 10 feet. The otters are curious and playful; they dart up to investigate anyone in the lake.
The otters delight in bumping small boats and tugging on their rails. Each time an otter bumps a boat, creatures in it must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall into the water. The otters are easily distracted by anyone tossing them small objects; they play with such objects in their paws, pass

With sharp horns and yet, snooze with the unicorns stamblermed a friendly deliant in philosophical pirates.

the objects between each other, or play fetch with whoever threw the objects.
Boat. A wide rowboat boat is tied to the jetty on the western bank. The boat can comfortably hold up to six Medium creatures and has two oars.

## G19: Water Palace

At the center of the lake, a marble building gleams with gilded fittings. It has tall, glazed windows and is dotted with elongated archways. A veranda runs around the outside of the building ten feet above the water. Two stairways with ornate rails descend to a stone pier just above the lake's surface.

The water palace is a lovely place for relaxation and quiet meetings. It's open to all.
Main Floor. The main room is open and airy, with a long white table in the center surrounded by four padded chairs. A crystal decanter and four matching glasses sit on a silver tray.
Otter Den. The otters have a den in the flooded "basement" of the palace. A hole in the wall under the west side of the docking platform allows them to swim in and out of the den. The floor is covered in gravel, fish bones, and shells. Stairs ascend to a loft with a nest and four playful baby giant otters (weasels with a swimming speed of 30 feet).

## G20: The Gardener's Rest

A ten-foot-wide tunnel in a steep rise is supported by wooden beams and a lintel, which are covered in the pink blossoms of climbing dog-rose plants and hanging wisteria. A well-trodden grass path between verdant shrubs and wildflowers leads to the opening.

This is the Gardener's home. The tunnel leads into a roughly hewn stone room with terraced shelves and many soil beds on the floor. Plants, mushrooms, moss, and lichen of all kinds grow in the beds. A door in the back wall leads to a room with a moss bed and stacks of books from other worlds, all discussing botany and nature.
The Gardener (see appendix B) is present the first time the characters arrive. The archfey is friendly toward the characters and curiously inquires as to their business in the domain. After some initial investigation of the characters' intentions, the Gardener offers refreshment. If the characters have behaved peacefully toward the garden's denizens, the Gardener also casts the Heroes' Feast spell to produce a repast of delicious vegetables for the characters.

If the characters attack the Gardener, the archfey defends themself, all the while admonishing the characters for their rudeness and offering several chances to have a more polite discussion.
What the Gardener Knows. The Gardener is happy to answer general questions about the garden and its creators. If the characters are respectful, the archfey confirms that Juliana and Orlando are present in the domain. If asked either where the lovers are now or how to leave the garden, the Gardener encourages the characters to solve the hedge maze (area G21) to find what they're looking for.
Key Leaves. The dog-rose leaves here are a key to the teleportation sundial in the maze (area G21).

## G21: Hedge Maze

A fifteen-foot-high hedge wall with wickedly long thorns rises from the meadow. Three of the walls are solid; an opening in the western wall leads into a maze of hedgerow corridors.

This shifting hedge maze surrounds the means to enter the Palace of Spires: a magic sundial.
Maze. Each time creatures enter the maze, the path through is different. To successfully navigate the maze, a creature must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Survival) check or reemerge at its starting point. Groups that enter the maze together make this check as a group check. A creature can create a more direct route by pushing through the walls, but it risks running afoul of the hedges' thorns (see the "Hedges" section below). A straight path between the center of the maze and its starting point has $1 \mathrm{~d} 3+1$ hedge walls in the way.
Residents of the garden and any creatures that have succumbed to the entrancement of the Fountain All Heal (area G9) instinctively know the correct path through the maze, automatically succeeding on checks to navigate it.
Hedges. The hedge wall is 5 feet thick and immune to all damage. A creature can force its way through the wall, spending 4 feet of movement for each foot traveled. Creatures that push through a hedge wall must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 31 (7d8) piercing damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.
Sundial. In the center of the maze is a rose-quartz sundial with a silver gnomon. The dial always shows noon during the day. Leaf-shaped impressions carved into the four corners of the sundial's face depict plants found throughout the garden: dog rose, mistletoe, oak, and shamrock. A character can identify the leaves with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) or Wisdom (Survival) check.

The leaves act as keys to the sundial. If all the appropriate leaves are placed in their respective impressions, the sundial glows, and every creature in the center of the maze is transported to area P1 of the Palace of Spires (detailed in the following section). The leaves are then consumed.
The Sundial Keys table outlines where each type of key leaf can be found in the garden.

## Sundial Keys

| Key Leaf | Location |
| :-- | :-- |
| Dog rose | Fountain All Heal (area G9), Gardener's Rest <br> (area G20) |
| Mistletoe | Barkburrs' Grove (area G11) |
| Oak | Great Oak Tree (area G3), Dryads' Woods <br> (area G5), Barkburrs' Grove (area G11) |
| Shamrock | Leprechaun Woods (area G2), Great Oak Tree <br> (area G3) |

## Palace of Spires

Porphura constructed this magnificent palace to house herself and Caerwyn, her beloved. The palace once stood where the hedge maze (area G21) now does, facing the lake in the garden. Composed of striking purple-red porphyry stone, the palace remains a comfortable domicile for those who find their way here now.
After Caerwyn's death, Porphura built a tomb for them both in the palace's crystal dome. With the Gardener's help, the grieving wizard performed her last great work: drawing the entire structure into a demiplane accessible only through the sundial at the heart of the maze. When all was arranged, she laid down with Caerwyn for the final time and let the magic that preserved her own life beyond its natural span end. The Gardener said their final farewell to Caerwyn and Porphura, sealed the tomb, and left the palace forever. Out of respect for their late friends, the Gardener won't enter the Palace of Spires for any reason.

## Palace of Spires Features

Unless otherwise specified, the Palace of Spires has the following features:
Ceilings. Ceilings in the palace are vaulted and 40 feet high.
Indestructible. The palace and its furnishings are immune to all damage and can't have their forms changed.
Lighting. Soft light permeates the demiplane. Light outside the palace matches that of the Eternal Garden (see the "Eternal Garden Features" section), while interior areas are brightly lit by Continual Flame spells.
Secret Doors. Some doors in the palace blend in with their surroundings. A character who searches for a secret door and succeeds on a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check finds it.
Time. Time in the demiplane moves at the same rate as in the Eternal Garden.

## Palace of Spires Locations

The following locations are keyed to map 4.3.

## P1: Gatehouse

A short, square tunnel constructed from purple-red stone leads to a lush garden enclosed in a courtyard. Behind you, a pair of close-meshed silver gates block the path. Beyond the gates wavers a colorful haze that occasionally provides a glimpse of the lake in the garden you left.

Creatures who solve the sundial puzzle in the maze (area G21) arrive here. The silver gates can't be opened or damaged. If a creature slips through the bars or teleports past them, they can't travel beyond the haze, which is the boundary of the demiplane in which the palace resides.

## P2: Walled Garden

Tall porphyry walls enclose a beautiful garden, and a glassy reflecting pool dances with the twilight colors of the sky above. Luminous butterflies flit above vivid flower beds that stand to the left and right of the pool.
Just outside the gatehouse stands a sundial identical to the one in the hedge maze. Paths of colorful gravel lead throughout the garden and to the palace proper.

The outer wall is 20 feet high, and the flowers in the garden remain perpetually in full bloom. The reflecting pool is 1 foot deep.

Sundial. The sundial here functions identically to the one in the hedge maze (area G21), but the leaves required to operate it don't grow within the demiplane. If the characters didn't bring extra leaves with them when they entered, they must find the reusable keys carried by the current occupants of the palace (see areas P6 and P7) to leave it. Activating this sundial returns the characters to the center of the maze.

## P3: CORNER BOWERS

Sweet, gentle music without a source fills this bower, which consists of a small, circular alcove with a padded bench and a canopy of flowering vines.

These bowers are compelling spots to rest. The disembodied music soothes worry and weariness. A drowsy feeling washes over a creature that enters, though it is under no compulsion to sleep.
Refreshin' Rest. A creature that finishes a short rest in the bower instead gains the benefits of finishing a long rest. The creature can't benefit from this property again for 24 hours.

## P4: Entrance Porch

A broad flight of porphyry steps ascends to a massive arched doorway. The arch over the double door protrudes from the wall and is supported by two stone columns carved in the likeness of two women, a human and an elf. Black letters across the arch read, "Enter in Peace."

The doors are ten feet wide, thirty feet high, and made of silver. They have no handles and are decorated with etched geometric patterns.

The two column statues are depictions of Caerwyn and Porphura. The statues are living guardians (use the earth elemental stat block). They animate and attack anyone who tries to force the doors open by any means. The columns stop attacking a creature that ceases its attempt and lays down any weapons it's wielding. If all creatures do so, the guardians return to their original positions. If the guardians are destroyed, they reform at the next dawn.
Doors. The words above the door appear written in the preferred language of whoever reads them. The doors open for a creature only if that creature approaches the doors with no weapons bared. A character can force the doors open with a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check or with a Knock spell, but doing so prompts the guardians to attack.
