# The Infinite Staircase

The Infinite Staircase ushers travelers to the destinations of their dreams. The impossible staircase winds in a surreal demiplane, ascending to every world, every plane of existence, and the adventure locations found among them. Though stories abound along its many steps, the staircase is the journey, not the destination-an extraordinary means of traversing the multiverse.
This chapter expands on what's written about the Infinite Staircase in the Dungeon Master's Guide and provides tools for using it to convey creatures from one fantastical location to the next.

## Staircase Features

The following sections describe features of the Infinite Staircase that are likely to come into play.

## DAY AND NIGHT

The staircase doesn't experience day or night, existing in a perpetual state of twilight. Distant doors, twinkling like stars, provide dim light to the dreamlike realm, as does the staircase itself, which gives off an ambient glow in some stretches.

## Doors and Landings

Endless doors along the staircase connect it to destinations throughout the multiverse. These doors function as planar portals (see the Dungeon Master's Guide) and are typically closed, though most are unlocked and don't require portal keys to enter.
Each door on the staircase occupies a landing with at least two staircases connected to it, leading to and from other landings and their respective doors. The doors and their landings are altered by planar magic, taking on characteristics of their destinations. Red light seeps from the seams of a gloomy, jet-black door to the Shadowfell set into a gothic archway; gargoyles perch on its landing, exuding roiling mist from their open mouths. A slippery ramp of deep-blue ice ascends to a frozen portal to the Paraelemental Plane of Ice, while a clammy bridge of basket fungus weaves toward a cavernous door to the Underdark.
Landings are frequent along the staircase but vary in distance from one another. Every landing contains at least one door. Travel between landings can take minutes, hours, or days.

## Gravity

On the Infinite Staircase, gravity is a logical forceuntil it isn't. The direction of its effect is perpendicular to the steps of the nearest staircase. Staircases twist, bend, and invert, occasionally allowing travelers on separate branches to look up at each other or leap from one part of the staircase to another.
A creature that falls off the staircase plummets $1 \mathrm{~d} 10 \times 50$ feet before crashing on the lower steps or the nearest landing below; it takes damage from the fall and lands with the prone condition as normal.
An object dropped on the staircase behaves predictably at first, falling down the steps until it comes to a halt or goes over the edge, at which point it continues "downward" until it collides with the next closest section of the staircase, and so on. Precious items lost in this way sometimes appear on the nearest landing, mysteriously returned to their owners.

## Indestructible

The Infinite Staircase is immune to all damage and can't have its form changed by spells like Passwall or similar magic. No one knows who or what built the staircase-or continues to add to it. Its masons are never seen but often heard, their hammers ringing in the distance like rolling thunder.

## Movement on the Staircase

The staircase includes a multitude of inclines, not just stairs. Ramps, hovering platforms, and clockwork conveyor belts can all be found along its endless construction.
A traveler can also move along the Infinite Staircase simply by thinking about moving, causing the incline to propel them toward their destination. Steps might roll beneath them like a magical escalator or flatten under them to create a ramp. The walking speed (in feet) of a creature that chooses to move in this way is equal to 10 times its Charisma modifier (minimum speed of 10 ).

## Weather

The Infinite Staircase doesn't have seasons. Its ambient temperature remains constant, comparable to a cool autumn evening with a gentle breeze and breathable air. Storms and extreme weather effects, except those caused by the staircase's denizens and their lairs, are virtually nonexistent.

## The Iron Shadow

The portals of the Infinite Staircase often lead to places that exhibit a penchant for creativity-sites where art, invention, philosophy, and magic flourish. Wherever there's a story to be told, the staircase might be found. As creativity wanes in these places, their doors and destinations change, and their landings on the staircase vanish over time. However, one force plays a more active role in their destruction: the Iron Shadow.

The Iron Shadow is a creeping malady that feeds on creativity in all its forms. A rootless, rolling cloud of gloom exhaled by the Shadowfell, the Iron Shadow darkens the doors of the staircase, sapping inspiration, novelty, and motivation from the planes and their inhabitants. It snuffs the spark of innovation and leaves its victims apathetic and dull. Wherever the shadow falls, creativity dies.

## Palls of Gloom

Areas of the staircase plagued by the Iron Shadow appear cold and lifeless and are shrouded in palls of magical gloom. A creature that enters the gloom for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 level of exhaustion. If this effect increases a creature's level of exhaustion above 5 , the creature becomes a shadow under the Iron Shadow's control. Nothing short of a Wish spell or divine intervention can reverse this transformation.

If an area of bright light created by a spell of 3rd level or higher overlaps with an area of gloom, that gloom disappears for 1 hour. Only a Wish spell can permanently expunge a patch of the Iron Shadow from the staircase.

## Umbral Manifestations

Aspects of the Iron Shadow occasionally take on physical forms, manifesting as memory webs (see appendix B), wraiths, or shadow dragons.

## Traversing the Staircase

No spell or magic item is required to access the Infinite Staircase, nor do its travelers have to contend with enigmatic rulers who dictate when its doors may open or who may pass through them. Unlike the city of Sigil, the crossroads of the multiverse, gods are free to enter and leave the Infinite Staircase as they please, though many reject it in favor of more direct methods of planar travel. The staircase is neutral ground accessible to all who can find and traverse it.

The act of traversing the staircase isn't any more tiring than walking, and creatures can't become exhausted by traveling along it.

Finding the Staircase
Entrances to the Infinite Staircase usually appear as nondescript doors in dusty, forlorn places that don't get many visitors-or wherever is most convenient for adventure. On any given plane, multiple doors to the Infinite Staircase can exist, but known entrances are closely guarded secrets occasionally protected by devas, sphinxes, yugoloths, and other powerful creatures. Likewise, these creatures sometimes stand watch on the staircase's landings, barring nefarious or unworthy travelers from passing through doorways to sensitive realms.
The Infinite Staircase Entrances table presents several places where an entrance to the Infinite Staircase might exist.

## Infinite Staircase Entrances

d10 Entrance
1 Curtain of a long-forgotten stage
2 Deepest door of an infamous lich's tomb
3 Door to a giant's outhouse
4 Fleshy aperture in a mind flayer's laboratory
5 Grandfather clock in an inventor's workshop
6 Locked wardrobe in a noble's mansion
7 Magical painting in the gallery of an esteemed artist
8 Permeable, sapient mirror in a wizard's tower
9 Private room in a famous tavern
10 Tree hollow in an enchanted forest

## Gates of the Moon

One fabled entrance to the staircase rests within the Gates of the Moon-a circular chamber within the shimmering palace Argentil, divine realm of the moon goddess Selûne on the plane of Ysgard. A spiral of silver steps, bathed in moonlight and entwined in dangling ivy, rises from the selenic hall, which some believe to be the base of the Infinite Staircase. Celestials, followers of Selûne, and lovers of the arts abound near the Gates of the Moon, which they regard as a sacred site.

## Locating Doors

Traveling to another plane requires locating a door that corresponds to the desired destination. There's no reason to the doors' arrangement, but creatures on the staircase longing for a specific destination feel the tug of its magic pulling them toward where they want to go. Finding the right door is a matter of exploration and time: locating the correct one takes 4 d 12 hours of travel. If a creature has visited the door before, this time is halved.
Doors along the staircase can lead anywhere. The Infinite Staircase Doors table provides a sampling of doors and destinations that characters might discover while exploring the Infinite Staircase.
