# Eternal Garden Features

The Eternal Garden has the following features:
Boundary. At the border of the domain is a lightly obscuring mist, tinged with a sweet blossom scent and the colors of sunset. No matter how far a creature travels into the mist, the creature finds itself back where it entered the border, returning to the garden.
Eternal Summer. The climate in the garden is a perpetual, lovely summer, but weather conditions reflect the emotional tone of creatures in the garden. In times of danger, thunderstorms shake the sky. During times of melancholy or mourning, chill rain patters throughout the domain.
Gardener's Vigil. The Gardener senses when anything dies in the garden. If a creature dies in the garden, roll a d6. On a 1, the Gardener appears on initiative count 20 of the next round (losing initiative ties) to investigate.

Lighting. The sky above the garden is a perpetual twilight range of orange, red, pink, and yellow hues with no visible sun, moon, or stars. During daylight hours, it emits bright light, but at night, it never reaches full darkness, becoming dim light instead.
Memory Loss. Unless otherwise stated, a creature that leaves the domain must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw; Fey creatures and creatures with the Fey Ancestry trait automatically succeed on the saving throw. On a failed save, the creature remembers nothing of its time in the garden or the Palace of Spires. On a successful save, the creature's memories remain intact, but they're hazy and dreamlike. A Remove Curse or Greater Restoration spell restores the creature's memories.
Time. Time passes slower in the Eternal Garden relative to other planes. For each day spent in the garden, one year passes on the Material Plane.

## Eternal Garden Locations

The following locations are keyed to map 4.2.

## G1: Fairy Ring

A ring of toadstools twenty feet across stands in the center of a forest clearing. Bright green grass and colorful wildflowers blanket the ground. The toadstools range from the size of a finger to as large as a chair.
Five figures sit on the largest toadstools. All are diminutive, jovial creatures-no more than three feet tall-wearing dapper, red clothing with gleaming buttons and buckles. Each wears a different style hat and regards you with delighted anticipation.

When the characters pass through the fey crossing in the Cave of Echoes (see area C7), they vanish and reappear in the center of this fairy ring. The characters all appear at the same time, even if they entered the alcove at different times.
Leprechauns. The five creatures are leprechauns (see appendix B) named Brunnick, Cellia, Flenas, Layleen, and Nerwyn. They are mischievous but fun loving, and all are genuinely delighted to see new visitors-mostly because they have new people to tease, as the rest of the garden's inhabitants have long grown weary of their antics.
Toadstools. The toadstools form a fairy ring that acts as a permanent teleportation circle, which can serve as the destination of teleportation magic and spells such as Plane Shift. Though the fairy ring once provided an exit from the garden, the fey crossing is now one-way, allowing exit only with a special key (see the "Returning to the Garden" section of this adventure's conclusion for more on exiting through the fairy ring).
What the Leprechauns Know. The leprechauns greet newcomers happily, responding to questions about themselves, the garden, and Juliana and Orlando with one or more of the cryptic rhymes shown in the Limericks table.
If the characters ply the leprechauns with amusements (leveraging the leprechaun's Reluctant Refusal trait), the charmed leprechauns let slip some hints to their riddles or their belief that the young lovers are the incarnations of the garden denizens' beloved friends, Caerwyn and Porphura.
If the leprechauns are attacked, they confuse foes with illusions or turn invisible and flee. They take care to return later to plague the characters with irksome pranks such as the following:

- Steal a weapon or magic item
- Steal a component pouch or spellcasting focus
- Fill armor, clothes, or packs with itching powder


## Limericks

## Limerick

The river o'er yonder appearing, Has five bridges of which you're hearing. The problem we set, Is how do you get, Across each and return to this clearing?
A fountain rests here in the garden, Whose waters, we hear, like to harden. But a drink now and then, Cures all in our ken, And may even bring cries of "Pardon!"
There's a lovely building just here, With turrets and domes far and near. 'Tis a shame you can't spy it, As we urge you to try it. Solve the puzzle and see it appear! Some may think our maze is a pest, But it shelters a haven of rest. And ere anyone leaves, They must leave more than leaves, And then honor our master's request. There are leaves in the garden to trace, And a maze with a clear central space. With a leaf in your hand, You could stand and stand, But to leave, leave the leaves in place. There once was a young man from Sybar, Who was stung on the nose by a wasp. We said, "Does it hurt?" He replied, "Not at all, It can do it again if it likes."

Nonsense, but it sends the leprechauns into gales of laughter and knowing winks
