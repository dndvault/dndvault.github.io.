# C7: Observation Parlor

Behind the waterfall is a room carved into the rock. Two steps ascend to a mosaic floor depicting birds, flowers, and fruit, which is littered with the long-collapsed remains of furniture and shards of broken glass.

A decorated alcove stands in the far wall opposite the entrance.

This was once a lounge Caerwyn and Porphura used to relax and enjoy the view of the crystal cave through the waterfall.
Alcove. This alcove is a fey crossing, a place of beauty where the Material Plane and the Feywild converge. Its walls are carved with a triptych woodland scene depicting forest animals and reveling satyrs, pixies, and sprites. The alcove radiates an aura of conjuration magic if observed with a Detect Magic spell, and any creature that moves into it vanishes, transported to area G1 of the Eternal Garden (detailed later in this adventure).

## Eternal Garden

Since being drawn into the Feywild, the Eternal Garden has become a Domain of Delight: a realm subject to the whims of the archfey who rules it. The overall composition and layout of the garden remain consistent from its days in the Material Plane, but Feywild magic has suffused it with a vibrancy beyond reality. Colors are more saturated, sounds are almost musical, and sensations pluck at a visitor's emotions, like the scent of a beloved childhood meal or the melody of a cherished tune.
Caerwyn and Porphura's magnificent home, the Palace of Spires, disappeared from the garden long ago. In the place where it once stood now looms an ever-changing hedge maze. Leaves growing throughout the garden act as keys to a magic sundial at the heart of the maze that transports those who solve it to the hidden palace.

## Garden Denizens

Fey creatures, awakened animals and plants, and wanderers both Humanoid and otherwise call the garden home. Some of its long-standing residents were once visitors from faraway places who elected to stay in the garden, which transformed them into Fey over time. These sapient beings tend to form communities, though some prefer solitude, and they all are free to wander the garden as whim or errand dictates. The residents' demesnes are indicated on map 4.2.

## Awakened Animals

Feywild magic has bestowed sapience on some of the Beasts that dwell within the Eternal Garden. Awakened animals in the garden speak Common and Sylvan.

## The Gardener

The archfey who governs the Eternal Garden is known simply as the Gardener (see appendix B). The Gardener was a lifelong friend of Caerwyn and Porphura and gladly bound themself to the garden. Now, the Gardener lovingly tends the garden as much because it is their own home as to honor their dear friends' memories. The Gardener doesn't tolerate any attempt to damage or significantly alter the garden, nor do they accept the killing of any of its residents. Digging a hole, breaking branches, or foraging for food is fine. More intrusive or violent actions such as damming a river, clear-cutting a forest, or slaughtering pixies draw the Gardener's ire.
The Gardener demands an explanation for transgressions worthy of their attention, and if the characters aren't contrite, the Gardener attacks to knock them unconscious and leaves them at the mercy of the leprechauns' mischief (see area G1). This is a one-time chance for the characters to amend their
behavior. If the characters continue to be a problem, the Gardener forcibly ejects them from the garden, teleporting the characters to the mouth of the Cave of Echoes. If the characters later return to the garden, its residents advise them to tread lightly.

## LOVE IN THE GARDEN

Juliana and Orlando have spent two days in the Eternal Garden-equal to two years on the Material Plane-wandering the garden's meadows in awed delight, thrilled and relieved to have found a sanctuary where they can live and love each other in peace. The garden's Fey and awakened residents feel a glimmer of their lost friends Caerwyn and Porphura in the young couple; many denizens are convinced Juliana and Orlando are the garden's creators reincarnated. As such, they're fiercely protective of the couple and become hostile toward intruders who threaten the lovers.

## RANDOM EnCOUNTERS

You can breathe life into the garden by introducing random encounters as the characters explore the realm. A random encounter occurs whenever you want one to, such as while the characters are traveling between locations. To determine what they find, roll on the Eternal Garden Encounters table. If you don't like the result, choose a different encounter you think would be fun.

## Eternal Garden Encounters

d8 Encounter
1 Two awakened giant badgers (see the "Awakened Animals" section) fret as they prepare their burrow for a visit from one of the badger's in-laws.
2 Two leprechauns (see appendix B) repair a large pile of worn-out shoes and boots. If the characters help, the leprechauns might give the characters a hint to one of their limerick riddles (see area G1).
3 Three satyrs argue as they pick berries for making wine. They ask the characters to settle a dispute over which of the satyrs has the best muscles.
4 Stargleam and Silverlily, the unicorns from area G15, discuss philosophy while on a walk.
5 Gnarlroot, the irascible treant from area G12, lumbers through the garden, grumbling to himself about the antics of a prank-loving leprechaun.
6 A fun-loving awakened tree uproots and blocks a character's path, mimicking their movements.
7 Gorguth the chimera (see area G7) flies overhead and lets out a fearsome roar. If the characters draw Gorguth's attention, he descends to meet them.
8 The Gardener (see appendix B) strolls through the area, humming merrily to themself, inspecting plants, and greeting the garden's inhabitants.
