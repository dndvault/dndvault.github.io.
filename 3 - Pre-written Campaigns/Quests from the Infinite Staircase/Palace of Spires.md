Map 43: Palace of Spires

## P5: Entrance Hall

This airy chamber's floor, walls, and lofty ceiling are made of gleaming white marble. Two doors lead from the room to the north and south. The hall's furnishings include two small, glass-topped tables, each with five chairs arranged around it. Each table holds a crystal decanter, five crystal glasses, and a bowl of fruit.

At the far end of the room, a large, semicircular atrium contains a splashing fountain. The atrium's soaring ceiling is transparent, letting the sky's colorful twilight glow fill the hall. An opaque rectangular shape darkens the center of the ceiling.

The fountain's central water jet climbs high above its pool. A metal staircase curves around the atrium's back wall to a landing forty feet above.

Natural light fills this vast entry hall. The atrium's ceiling rises to 80 feet, while the fountain's water jet peaks at 60 feet. The opaque shape above the atrium is the sarcophagus in the tomb (area P12).

Disturbance. Sounds of combat or other loud, alarming noises in this area draw the attention of Juliana and Orlando in area P6 as well as Argus and Hamish, a pair of former adventurers in area P7.

The latter two arm themselves and come quickly to investigate. Argus and Hamish ignore any ruckus that doesn't sound dangerous, attributing it to Juliana and Orlando and leaving the young couple their privacy.

Treasure. The decanters hold sweet wine, and the fruit is fresh and scrumptious. The two decanters are worth 50 gp each, and the ten glasses are worth 10 gp each. As long as they remain in the palace, the decanters and bowls refill every 24 hours.

## P6: Juliana and Orlando's Room

The floor of this spacious bedroom is decorated with mosaics depicting the four seasons. Covering one wall is a detailed tapestry showing two female mages, a human and an elf, picnicking in a woodland glade.

The furniture consists of a large four-poster bed, two chests, two worktables, six comfortable-looking chairs, and two couches. One of the couches hangs from the ceiling on delicate chains, and a young human man and woman relax on it as it gently sways. Slender golden perches dot the walls, and songbirds flit between them as they sing.

---

This bedroom once belonged to Caerwyn and Porphura, but the denizens of the garden insisted that Juliana and Orlando inherit it. A secret doorway in the northwest corner opens onto a spiral staircase leading to area P10.
Juliana and Orlando (neutral good, human nobles with Armor Class 11 and no armor or weapons) recline together here on the suspended couch, relaxing and chatting. They're dressed in bright lounging robes with slippers. The pair are surprised but not perturbed by the characters' arrival if it's peaceful. They are indifferent to the characters, and to their perception, they have been in the Eternal Garden for only two days, not the two years that have already passed on the island of Sybarate.
Juliana and Orlando gladly relate their tragic tale of forbidden love with sincerity-if a touch melodra-matically-and lament that their families can't see past the old feud. Eventually, it becomes clear the paramours have no intention of going home. A character who listens to the couple's story and succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence (Arcana) check realizes they have fallen under the enchantment of the Fountain All Heal (area G9). Characters who visited the fountain earlier make this check with advantage.
Breaking the Enchantment. Juliana and Orlando are under the enchantment of the Fountain All Heal and regard the palace as their new home. Until they're freed from the domain's allure-such as by a Wish spell granted in the tomb (see area P12)-they won't entertain any notion of leaving. If the effect on them is broken, the couple entertains reasonable arguments to return home and speak to their worried families.
Disturbance. Sounds of combat or other loud, alarming noises draw the attention of Argus and Hamish in area P7, who arm themselves and come quickly to investigate. The two ignore any noise that doesn't sound dangerous, preferring to give Juliana and Orlando their privacy.
Key Leaves. Juliana and Orlando each carry a set of gilt silver keys to the sundials in areas G21 and P2. The keys are metal replicas of the required leaves in lifelike detail. Unlike normal leaves, these keys aren't consumed by the sundial and travel with the user to the destination.
Treasure. The 20 -foot-square tapestry depicts Caerwyn and Porphura, is worth $1,000 \mathrm{gp}$, and weighs 300 pounds.
Julianna and Orlando's possessions are stored in the secret closet behind the tapestry and include two sets of fine clothes, two rapiers, two breastplates, a purse containing 30 gp and three diamonds worth 300 gp each, and a gold signet ring worth 50 gp bearing Orlando's family crest.

## P7: Argus and Hamish's Room

This bedroom's floor is a tile mosaic showing a night sky and a golden wheel with astrological symbols. The ceiling is similarly decorated with glittering gold stars.
The walls are whitewashed, and a tapestry covering one wall depicts two female mages, an elf and a human, holding hands. Their free hands are raised, producing magic that causes a magnificent garden to spring up around them as animals and fey creatures watch in awe.
The furniture in the room includes a large bed, two chests, six comfortable-looking chairs, two couches, and a wooden table. A suit of oiled leather armor, a round shield, and a well-worn spear adorn a mannequin in the corner.
Two middle-aged human men are present, one reclining on a couch with a book, the other sitting in a chair, whittling a piece of wood with a dagger.

This well-maintained room includes a secret doorway in the southwest corner that opens onto a spiral staircase leading to area P10.
Argus Velon (lawful good, human mage) and Hamish Parth (neutral good, human gladiator) are romantic partners and mercenaries. Sent by Governor Folcarae to rescue the young couple shortly after they absconded, Argus and Hamish succumbed to the Fountain All Heal and resolved to stay. When first encountered here, Argus is on a couch reading, and Hamish is whittling. Both wear silk lounging robes and slippers, with no other weapons or equipment. The couple are initially indifferent to newcomers but become friendly if approached peacefully.
The men tease each other fondly during conversation. They're grateful their dangerous vocation brought them together and eventually here. Like the other garden residents, Argus and Hamish believe Juliana and Orlando are the reincarnated creators of the garden-and they see their own love reflected in the couple. They're fiercely protective of the pair.
Breaking the Enchantment. If the characters break the fountain's enchantment on Argus and Hamish, the two are grateful but ultimately resolve to remain in the garden together of their own free will.
Key Leaves. Argus and Hamish each carry a set of gilt silver keys to the sundials in areas G21 and P2. The keys are metal replicas of the required leaves in lifelike detail. Unlike normal leaves, these keys aren't consumed and travel with the user to the destination. The couple also keeps sets of spare key leaves in a secret closet (see the "Treasure" section).

---

Treasure. The 20 -foot-square tapestry depicts Caerwyn and Porphura, is worth $1,000 \mathrm{gp}$, and weighs 300 pounds.
A secret closet in the southeastern corner of the room holds Argus' spellbook, which contains all his prepared spells; a Wand of Magic Detection; an ivory inlaid box ( 150 gp ) holding five sets of spare key leaves (see the "Key Leaves" section above); two Potions of Healing (greater); and a bag with 10 pp , $20 \mathrm{gp}, 15 \mathrm{sp}$, and a flawed emerald worth 500 gp .

## P8: GALLERY

Curving metal stairs ascend to an art gallery that constitutes the palace's second floor. A low stone rail guards against falling over the edge into the entrance hall below.

Two rows of three marble statues stand in the gallery. The northern row depicts an elf woman in different poses and wearing either an elegant gown or druidic garb. The southern row shows a human woman in wizardly robes or smart finery. Two more statues occupy a pair of alcoves to the west.

On the wall directly ahead hangs a large painting showing the same couple dancing on the shores of a lake.

The art in this room all depicts Caerwyn and Porphura. The pieces are affixed to the building and can't be moved from their positions or destroyed.

## P9: Roof Gardens

Crenelated parapets border the palace's open, flat roof. Four beds of subtly colored flowers are divided by gravel paths. In the center of the beds where the paths cross is a small table and four chairs.

The roof gardens are lovely spots to sit and relax while enjoying an excellent view of the walled garden below (area P2).

## P10: CRYSTAL BRIDGES

A delicate span of glass arches from the tower door to another spire twenty feet away. Nothing else supports the crystal bridge.

The crystal bridges are perfectly sturdy despite their appearance and offer a safe but bracing walk to the upper rooftop garden.

## P11: Upper Roof Garden

This roof garden is bound on three sides by a low, crenelated parapet and holds two long flower beds. The north bed holds spotless white roses, while the south bed contains roses of a deep red hue.
Between the flower beds, a crushed stone path leads to a flight of steps that rises to a round stone room surmounted by a transparent crystal dome.

This garden leads the way to the tomb of Caerwyn and Porphura (area P12), offering a moment of serene contemplation and fresh air.

---

A great crystal dome surmounts the circular wall of this room, and its floor is similarly transparent. Light from the twilight sky shines through the dome and into the entry hall far below.
A three-foot-high, white-marble sarcophagus rests in the center of the floor. Surmounting the slab are the carved figures of two women, a human and an elf, in repose. An engraving inlaid with gold glitters on the side of the slab at the figures' feet.

As with other crystalline structures in the palace, the floor of this tomb is perfectly safe thanks to the indestructible nature of the demiplane's materials.
Final Rest. The sarcophagus holds the perfectly preserved remains of Caerwyn and Porphura. The carved figures on the lid are exquisitely lifelike in their rendering. As an action, a creature can open the sarcophagus with a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check.
Inscription. The gold lettering on the foot of the tomb is written in Common and reads as follows:

Oh stranger, whom destiny hath led nigh, Leave us interred in peace to lie. If thou wouldst deign to grant our request, Then fate will move at thy behest. This gift from the contented dead, We swear to grant by our heart and head.

Treasure. The true treasure of the tomb is indicated by the inscription. If a creature visits the tomb but leaves its sarcophagus undisturbed, the magic of the palace grants the creature one casting of the Wish spell, fulfilled by the spirits of Caerwyn and Porphura on the creature's behalf. As the creature departs the tomb, a pair of joyful voices whisper to it in unison. The voices thank the creature for its respect and inform the creature that its next wish spoken aloud before it leaves the garden will be granted. A creature can gain only one wish from the tomb, no matter how many times it visits.
The tomb errs toward the spirit of a wish rather than the strict letter and doesn't twist the wisher's intent, especially if the wish is made to free a creature from the Fountain All Heal's enchanting draught. Feel free to allow wishes to be partially granted, or to simply inform a player their stated wish isn't fulfilled and they can try again.
If a creature opens the sarcophagus, the palace grants no further wishes, and any it has granted within the last 24 hours are immediately undone.

Inside the sarcophagus lie the perfectly preserved bodies of Caerwyn and Porphura in each other's arms as if only sleeping. Dressed in simple, white, linen robes, they wear matching gold rings ( 100 gp each). The interred lovers have no wish to return to life, and any magic used to resurrect them or speak to their corpses fails.

## CONCLUSION

If Juliana and Orlando are freed from the fountain's enchantment, they can easily be persuaded to return home to their families if the characters mention that two years have passed for their families or that their families have settled their feud. The couple takes some time to change into their original clothes and gather their equipment. They bid Argus and Hamish a fond, emotional farewell and depart with the characters.

## Returning to the Garden

When the characters leave the Palace of Spires and return to the garden, the Gardener is waiting for them in the center of the maze. How they greet the party depends on how the characters dealt with the tomb.

## Respected the Tomb

If the characters didn't open the sarcophagus in Caerwyn and Porphura's tomb, the Gardener joyfully greets the characters as if they were old friends. The archfey speaks to each character of the character's individual exploits as if the Gardener witnessed them all, with sincere excitement and admiration. If anyone asks the Gardener about the other garden denizens' belief that Juliana and Orlando are the reincarnations of the gardens' creators, the archfey smiles and requests the characters allow the others to hold onto their beliefs, and to realize the truth-whatever it may be-in their own time. When asked directly if the young lovers are Caerwyn and Porphura reborn, the Gardener is slyly evasive with a twinkle in their eye.
After offering their well wishes, the Gardener hands each character (and Juliana and Orlando if they're present) a white flower petal and informs them the fairy ring (area G1) can take them home if they carry the petal into the circle. The archfey then gives a fond farewell and takes their leave.
When a creature carrying one of the petals steps into the fairy ring, a whirl of multicolored flower petals engulfs the creature and gracefully transports it to the mouth of the Cave of Echoes. The Gardener allows the characters, as well as Juliana and Orlando, to return to the Material Plane with their memories intact. A year has passed on the Material Plane for each day they spent in the Eternal Garden.

## DeSECRATED THE TOMB

If the characters opened the sarcophagus, a sense of creeping dread settles over them when they return to the maze, and the air has an uncomfortable chill-the garden's endless summer has ended. The hedges of the maze appear withered and dead, and the Gardener is furious. The archfey scolds any characters who participated in the desecration of the tomb, barely resisting resorting to violence.
With a final curse, the Gardener waves a hand, and an icy gale rips through the area, depositing the characters unceremoniously outside the Cave of Echoes. The fey crossing to the Eternal Garden never functions for them again.
Should the characters return to the garden by other means, the domain has become twisted and bitter. Plants are wilted, denizens are vicious, and the climate bears the cold bite of winter. The Gardener no longer eschews violence and seeks to vent their fury on the characters.

## Completing THE QUEST

Once returned to the Material Plane, the characters can deliver the news of their success (or failure) to Governor Folcarae. If the characters lingered in the garden, the governor is astonished to see them, remarking that she thought they'd never return.

## With Juliana and Orlando

If the characters bring Juliana and Orlando home, the governor is overjoyed, letting her elation and relief crack her usually measured exterior. After a tearful reunion with her daughter and a slightly awkward but heartfelt welcome to Orlando, the governor pays the characters their promised reward in the form of 10 platinum trade bars. Each bar weighs 1 pound and is worth 500 gp .

## Empty-Handed

If the characters failed to bring the missing lovers home, the governor is crestfallen but recovers her composure quickly. She thanks the characters for their efforts, but it's clear she's merely being polite. After the governor bids them a terse farewell, the characters can remain in Sybar for a few days before their welcome is obviously worn out. Word spreads of their failure, and merchants and innkeepers raise prices, add steep "taxes" to their goods, and eventually refuse service altogether.
