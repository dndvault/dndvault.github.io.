# Cave of Echoes

![img-35.jpeg](Quests%20from%20the%20Infinite%20Staircase_img-35.jpeg)

Map 4.1: Cave of Echoes
A creature that makes a selfish or destructive request causes thunderous reprimands to reverberate through the chamber, triggering the effects of loud echoes (see the "Loud Echoes" section). Once a creature asks a question here and receives a benefit, no matter how small, the creature can't do so again for 1 year and 1 day.

## C3: Haunted GaverN

The floor of this cavern is ridged like sand at the bottom of a stream. It's dotted with slender stalagmites and littered with broken stalactites from the ceiling thirty feet above. The main tunnel continues to the east, and smaller side chambers extend to the north and the south.

Three poltergeists (variant specters) haunt the main chamber of the cavern, venting their fury on intruders. The restless spirits hurl broken stalactites at unsuspecting entrants or toss creatures onto pointed stalagmites in the cavern.
A cavity to the north collects moisture dripping from the ceiling. An ochre jelly lurks here, content to feed on fungus and the remains of the poltergeists' occasional victims. It slithers into the main cavern if battle breaks out.

Stalagmites. The rock formations throughout this cavern are dangerously sharp. A creature pushed into a stalagmite takes 11 (2d10) piercing damage.
Treasure. The skeleton of a decades-dead human knight rests in the south chamber, impaled on a stalagmite by the poltergeists. Most equipment the knight once carried has rusted or rotted away, but a Necklace of Adaptation hangs around the dead warrior's neck. Scattered on the floor beneath the skeleton are $8 \mathrm{pp}, 22 \mathrm{gp}$, and a yellow topaz $(250 \mathrm{gp})$.

## C4: Living Mud Gavern

This cavern is large and irregular in shape. The bare rock floor forms a shallow depression that contains a mud pool fed by a sluggish stream flowing from the southeast. Near the west side of the pool are two mounds of dried mud.

The stream flowing from area C6 ends here in a 1 -foot-deep mud pool. The mud is difficult terrain.
The magic-infused water bestowed animate life on the mud, creating two mud elementals that lurk in the pool. A character who surveys the pool and succeeds on a DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check notices the mud elementals.

---

Each mud elemental uses the water elemental stat block with the following changes:

- It has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in mud.
- Its speed isn't reduced in difficult terrain composed of earth or mud.
The elementals attack any creatures that approach the mud or the mounds of dried mud, but they don't pursue creatures out of the area and sink back into the mud if foes flee.
Treasure. The mounds encase the desiccated remains of two adventures slain by the mud elementals. The adventurers were sent by the governor to find Juliana and Orlando but never returned. Once the elementals are dead, weapons or tools can easily break away the mud shells covering the remains.
One mound entombs the remains of a human warrior. His chain mail, shield, and longsword are rusted but still functional, and he has 20 gp in a crumbled purse.
The other mound holds the remains of an elf thief with a set of thieves' tools, 50 gp , and 50 pp . Her shriveled hand clutches a +1 Da«µger with the name "Madrigal" carved into its ivory handle in Elvish.


## C5: Stream Tunnel

A narrow stream runs along the bottom of this winding tunnel. The echoes of the stream's soft babbling are unusually loud.
Partway along the stream's path, the waterway widens to a ten-foot-wide pool before it narrows again and continues.

The stream flows from the waterfall in area C6 to the mud pool in area C4.
Treasure. The pool is 3 feet deep, with a bottom of smooth rocks and pebbles that have washed down the stream. A character who searches the pool and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check realizes that seven of the smooth rocks are uncut gemstones: two garnets ( 10 gp each), two blue tourmalines ( 15 gp each), an amber ( 20 gp ), a moonstone ( 25 gp ), and a cloudy diamond ( 50 gp ). A character who spends 10 minutes sifting through the river bottom succeeds on the check automatically.
A character who has proficiency with jeweler's tools can cut the gems with two days of work per gem. Doing so multiplies each gem's value by ten.

## C6: Crystal Cave

The echoes of the stream fade, replaced by an ethereal melody that tugs at your heartstrings. Massive formations of quartz crystals cover the walls and ceiling of this chamber.
A motionless waterfall pours from a crack near the ceiling of the east wall-a time-frozen curtain of water and hanging droplets. It collects into a wide, similarly static pool below. Farther from the water's source, the pool slowly begins to ripple, then drains into the stream that flows out the tunnel.

This crystal chamber is tethered to the Eternal Garden and by extension the Feywild. The waterfall isn't truly unmoving, but it pours so slowly it appears that way to casual observation. It takes 20 minutes for a droplet to fall from the ceiling into the pool.
Crystals. Any bright light in the room refracts through the crystals and fills the chamber with a soft glow and dazzling rainbow patterns.
Music. The disembodied melody carries the emotional resonance of the Feywild and evokes nostalgia in those who hear it. Characters who listen to the music can feel it tugging at memories from their pasts, whether joyful or otherwise.
The music causes momentary ripples in the seemingly frozen waterfall. A character who studies the waterfall and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check notices the ripples and their connection to the music.
Pool. The pool is 5 feet deep. At the end the waterfall pours into, it too appears frozen in time, while at the far end, the water perceptibly flows into the stream. Within 10 feet of the waterfall, the pool is solid enough to walk on, though anything stationary on the water's surface slowly sinks to the bottom over the course of 1 minute.
Waterfall. The waterfall blocks passage to the fey crossing in area C7. Like the pool, the waterfall is nearly solid, and it blocks the tunnel except for a 1 -inch gap on either side. The waterfall is 5 feet thick. A creature that looks through it with a light source can make out a passage hidden behind the falls.
Traversing the waterfall is difficult but can be accomplished through the following means:
Brute Force. As an action, a character can force their way through the falls with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check. A character who fails the check still manages to push through but gains 1 level of exhaustion from the exertion.

---

Song. A character can create a temporary passage through the water by humming, singing, or playing a song. As an action, a character who performs a song and succeeds on a DC 15 Charisma (Performance) check creates a 5 -foot-wide opening in the waterfall for 1 minute.
Spells. Magic offers the following solutions:

- Control Water parts or raises the waterfall for the spell's duration.
- Create or Destroy Water cast to destroy part of the waterfall destroys a 5 -foot-cube of water, which fills in after 1 minute.
- Teleportation bypasses the waterfall as normal.
- A creature under the effect of a Slow spell more closely matches the waterfall's altered time and can move through the waterfall as if it were difficult terrain.
- A successful Dispel Magic spell (DC 15) cast on the waterfall causes it to flow normally for 1 minute, during which time creatures can move through the water as if it were difficult terrain.
At the DM's discretion, other solutions to bypassing the waterfall might exist.
