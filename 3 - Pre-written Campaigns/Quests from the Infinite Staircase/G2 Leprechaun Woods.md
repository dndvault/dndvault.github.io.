# G2: Leprechaun Woods

This lush forest brims with game and edible plants. A massive oak tree, the only oak in this region, looms above the rest of the forest. Among the undergrowth, shamrock plants thrive.

The leprechauns in area G1 often roam this forest. They hide here after pulling pranks on the garden's denizens.
Key Leaves. The shamrock leaves that grow in this area function as a key to the teleportation sundial in the maze (area G21).

## G3: Great Oak Tree

A tremendous oak tree stretches hundreds of feet into the air, rising high above the surrounding canopy. Easily fifty feet wide at the base, its trunk is gnarled, covered with creeping greenery, and surrounded by flowering shamrocks.

Several leprechauns live inside this great oak. The interior is sized for Small creatures and is brightly lit by cage lanterns full of fireflies. At any given time, 1d4 friendly leprechauns (see appendix B) are here, enjoying the comforts of their home.
Hidden Home. An illusion hides the front door to the tree house at ground level. A character who studies the tree trunk and succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence (Investigation) check discerns the illusion for what it is.
The first floor of the tree home is a circular kitchen with wooden furnishings and simple flatware for five. It's stocked with nutritious food, water, and wine. A spiral staircase carved into the interior wall of the trunk rises to a bedroom with five crisply made beds arranged radially around the wall. A chest at the foot of each bed holds fashionable cloth-ing-most of it red-and blankets.

Kitchen Pit. Beneath the kitchen table is a secret trapdoor. A character who searches the kitchen and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check discovers the door. It leads to a tunnel that ends in a cave-in with several crushed humanoid skeletons visible at its edge, but this is an illusion concealing a 6 -foot-deep pit. A character who searches the tunnel and succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence (Investigation) check, or who tries to interact with the illusion physically, discerns the illusion for what it is.
Key Leaves. The shamrock and oak leaves that grow in this area function as keys to the teleportation sundial in the maze (area G21).
Treasure. A character who digs at the bottom of the kitchen pit discovers a pouch with an Ioun Stone (sustenance) and two dull-gray stones that lost their magic long ago. Digging deeper reveals a copper crock filled with $2,500 \mathrm{gp}$-the leprechauns' collected gold. If the gold is stolen, the leprechauns stop at nothing to retrieve it.

## G4: Endless River

This babbling river flows through the garden, sometimes defying logic. Here and there, its waters seemingly course in different directions, and it teems with colorful fish and other freshwater fauna.

---

![img-38.jpeg](Quests%20from%20the%20Infinite%20Staircase_img-38.jpeg)

The river is home to Vuuthramis, a shy but playful young bronze dragon. She lives in a cave hidden beneath the river. Vuuthramis drank from the Fountain All Heal (area G9) and succumbed to its enchantment. As a result, she has no desire to keep a treasure hoard. She's content to swim and frolic in the river, occasionally venturing onto its banks.
Vuuthramis cautiously observes characters near the riverbank. Characters who survey the river or enter its waters and succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check spot the dragon, who keeps her distance. If a character reacts peacefully and succeeds on a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check, Vuuthramis overcomes her reticence. Otherwise, she darts away, only to return later.

Capricious River. The river ranges from 10 to 20 feet in depth and 10 to 50 feet in width. Its flow is unpredictable, reversing at various points along its ovular length. Roll a die for any 100 -foot stretch of river. On an even number, it flows clockwise; on an odd number, it flows counterclockwise.
What Vuuthramis Knows. Vuuthramis watches and listens along the course of the river and knows the surrounding inhabitants. If a character overcomes the dragon's shyness, she tells the characters about a few of the garden's denizens, such as Gnarlroot, the treant in area G12, who "seems extra grumpy today."
In addition to this general knowledge, Vuuthramis witnessed Juliana and Orlando stop to picnic with a group of pixies and sprites from the fairy forest (area G10) on the riverbank two days earlier, before the pair continued west.

## G5: Dryads' Woods

This forest is dense and difficult to travel, with only a few worn footpaths connecting its small clearings. Most of the trees here are old, mighty oaks.

Two dryads, Sonna and Yvra, tend to this stretch of woods. Sonna and Yvra were once knights in service to rival Fey courts who fell in love. As punishment for defying their rulers to pursue a relationship, they were bound to oak trees and separated. The Gardener heard their lamentations, and when Caerwyn and Porphura approached the archfey to take charge of the domain, the Gardener stole Sonna and Yvra's trees from their jailers and planted them here, where the dryads could finally be together.
The dryads enjoy playing card games, especially a simple bluffing game known as myriad. If the characters behave peacefully, the dryads challenge a willing character to a quick round. To win the game, a character must succeed on a DC 17 Charisma (Deception) check to out-bluff the dryads or a DC 17 Wisdom (Insight) check to catch them in a lie.
What the Dryads Know. The dryads correctly suspect Juliana and Orlando are in the Palace of Spires but are hesitant to say anything. They see themselves in the missing lovers and won't risk bringing them to harm. However, if a character beats Sonna and Yvra at myriad, the dryads reluctantly suggest that Gnarlroot, the treant in the south ravine (see area G12), might know more.
Key Leaves. The oak leaves here are a key to the teleportation sundial in the maze (area G21).
Treasure. Fluttering in the branches of Sonna's tree is a Cloak of Elvenkind. Yvra's tree has the set's matching Boots of Elvenkind hidden in a hollow.

---

One of the boots holds a leather pouch containing thin ivory plates whose illustrations resemble those of the storied Deck of Many Things. The deck is nonmagical and worth 100 gp . Yvra uses them to play a solitary card game called patience.

## G6: Satyrs' Forest

This section of the forest is less dense, allowing light to dapple the ground. Clearings and paths abound, many of which show signs of regular use: discarded bottles, trampled earth, and ashes from old bonfires. The clearing ahead thrums with music and laughter.

Five satyrs revel in this forest. The largest clearing in the woods is surrounded by flowering shrubs and has a single towering elm tree in the center. The satyrs live here, sleeping on pallet beds surrounding the elm tree. Their leader, Xanim, carries a set of panpipes and leads their carousing.
Xanim and his kin (Kren, Vella, Zamuel, and Liss) are incorrigible gossips. They gleefully greet any newcomers and urge them to join the revelry.
Trapped Hollow. The satyrs' treasure is tucked into a hollow formed by the elm's gnarled roots and guarded by a hidden noose snare. A creature that steps close enough to search the root hollow must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or be hoisted 20 feet into the air. The creature has the restrained condition until it gets free by cutting the rope or slipping out as an action with a successful DC 16 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. A character who surveys the hollow from a distance and succeeds on a DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) check discovers the trap, which can be disarmed by poking it with a stick or tool to set it off.
What the Satyrs Know. If the characters share any juicy tidbits of gossip with the satyrs, such as the name of a secret crush, the satyrs respond with stories about other denizens of the garden, particularly the leprechauns. The satyrs show open annoyance at the leprechauns' pranks and hint that by offering the leprechauns a dance or fine meal, the characters might be able to persuade them to part with more information. The satyrs know of Juliana and Orlando but haven't met them; they eagerly look forward to partying with the "new arrivals."
Treasure. In the tree hollow is a leather sack containing 400 gp and a locked wooden box. As an action, a character can pick the lock with a successful DC 20 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check using thieves' tools. The box holds three sapphires (200 gp each), a Potion of Animal Friendship, a Potion of Diminution, a Potion of Healing (greater), and a set of fine reed pipes worth 25 gp .

## G7: Chimera's Crag

A rocky outcropping runs along the northern border of the garden. A small ravine cuts into the rocks, its floor scorched free of vegetation and dusted with ash.

Gorguth the chimera drank from the Fountain All Heal and became enchanted by it. The chimera now lairs on a crag at the back of the ravine. Over the years, the magic of the garden kindled a spark of understanding in the creature. He is indifferent toward the garden's denizens and peaceful visitors.
Gorguth is a chimera with the following changes:

- His alignment is chaotic neutral.
- He speaks Common and Draconic.

Gorguth enjoys flying over the garden, occasionally performing threatening but harmless swoops near anyone he sees. When he spots the characters, he makes an intimidating display, scorching the ground with his fire breath before landing on his crag to observe their reactions. Each character must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw to keep their composure. Characters immune to the frightened condition automatically succeed on this save. If any characters keep their composure, Gorguth becomes friendly and willing to chat. If every character fails the save, the chimera laughs and returns to the sky.
What Gorguth Knows. Gorguth observed Juliana and Orlando during their travels and knows they've spent a great deal of time talking with the Gardener, who lives in a cave across the lake (see area G20).

## G8: Bears' Range

A cave toward the northern edge of the garden overlooks a swath of wildflower-stippled grassland.

A mated pair of awakened brown bears (see the "Awakened Animals" section) and their awakened cub (use the black bear stat block) live in the cave and claim the surrounding area as their territory. The adult bears are hostile toward strangers but not violent unless provoked. Suspicious of visitors, they warn trespassers to back away from their den. The cub is indifferent-curious but skittish.
What the Bears Know. The bears' attitudes improve by one step if the characters offer them food or if a character explains the party's presence and succeeds on a DC 12 Charisma (Persuasion) check.
The cub observed Juliana and Orlando two days ago. She followed them to the Fountain All Heal (area G9), where the pair quenched their thirst. If the characters improved the cub's attitude, she gladly agrees to lead the characters to the fountain.

---

The enchanting waters of the
fountain All HeAl make its dinners never want to leave the garden.

## G9: Fountain All HeAl

A spring of crystal-clear water bubbles up from the center of a natural rock basin. The water trickles down one side of the fountain, forming a small stream. Pink dog-rose blossoms grow around the basin.

Caerwyn and Porphura worked together to create this miraculous fountain; over the ages, entrancing Feywild magic has permeated its waters. The basin is 4 feet wide and 3 feet deep. The water spilling from the basin streams down the slope toward the lake (area G18).

Curative Water. The fountain's waters are cool, pure, refreshing-and a potent magical elixir. A creature that drinks from the basin gains the benefits of both the Greater Restoration spell (all its benefits) and the Heal spell, and any entities possessing the drinker are forced out.
Any water scooped from the basin must be drunk immediately to benefit from its properties. If bottled or removed from the fountain, the water loses its magic and turns into gravel.
Entrancing Draught. A creature that drinks from the fountain must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or permanently lose all desire to leave the Eternal Garden. Fey and creatures with the Fey Ancestry trait automatically succeed on the saving throw. An affected creature resists any attempt to forcibly remove it from the garden. If the creature is removed from the garden, it is overcome with an irresistible desire to return. This effect can be removed only by a Wish spell (such as those granted in the Palace of Spires, detailed later in this adventure); a carefully worded wish can free multiple creatures from the water's trance.
Key Leaves. The dog-rose leaves here are a key to the teleportation sundial in the maze (area G21).

## G10: Fairy Forest

Harmless insects abound in this forest. Butterflies, fireflies, and ladybugs flutter about, filling the canopy and undergrowth with flitting colors. A great willow tree atop a low hill sparkles with fairy lights and bioluminescent bugs.

This stretch of forest is home to a gathering of Fey folk. Six pixies and six sprites are present in and around the willow tree at any time. Though there are dozens of the Fey in total, most of them are gallivanting about the woods and the greater garden.
When the characters first enter the fairy forest, the six sprites here sneak up invisibly and attempt to

---

![img-39.jpeg](Quests%20from%20the%20Infinite%20Staircase_img-39.jpeg)
learn more about the visitors. The sprites and pixies are hostile to any evil creatures they discover and try to drive such foes away.
Fairy House. The pixies and sprites live in an abandoned badger burrow in the willow hill. Only Tiny creatures can fit through the foot-tall fairy door set into the burrow's entrance. The Fey furnished and decorated the burrow like a tiny house; it has four rooms.
What the Fairies Know. To non-evil beings, the pixies and sprites are perfectly amiable, revealing themselves and welcoming such characters to their home. If the characters inquire about the garden or any of its residents, the Fey huddle up and whisper among themselves before a spokes-pixie cheerfully announces they'll happily help in exchange for a gift. The pixie accepts any magic item, anything shiny or sparkly, or anything with a story imparted by the character who offers it.
After receiving an acceptable gift, the fairies disclose that several of them spent some time at a picnic with Juliana and Orlando on the couple's first day in the garden and eventually led them to the Fountain All Heal (area G9) to quench their thirst.
Treasure. Hidden in the fairies' burrow are a Potion of Clairvoyance and a gold ring ( 250 gp ) set with a Pearl of Power.

## G11: BARKBURRS' Grove

A dense grove here consists of eerie oak trees. From the corner of the eye, the trees resemble looming figures with crooked fingers. A singularly gnarled and ancient oak rises from the center of the grove. Clusters of mistletoe grow all over its branches, and something sparkles between its roots.

The smaller oak trees here evoke looming figures because they were all once people before they were transformed into trees by the two barkburrs (see appendix B) that cling to the central oak. The barkburrs attack any creature that comes within 20 feet of the tree. The Gardener doesn't punish creatures that defend themselves against the barkburrs, knowing more barkburrs will grow off the knobby oak in short order.
A creature petrified by the barkburrs can be returned to its true form by dunking its roots in the Fountain All Heal (area G9). It takes 1 minute for the transformed creature's roots to "drink" from the fountain's waters.
Key Leaves. The oak and mistletoe leaves here are keys to the teleportation sundial in the hedge maze (area G21).
Treasure. A sheathed +1 Longsword with a gem-encrusted hilt pokes up from the central oak's roots. The sword sheds light as a torch when drawn. Hanging from the high branches of a smaller oak is a black opal pendant ( $1,500 \mathrm{gp}$ ). A character who searches the grove and succeeds on a DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) check notices the pendant.

## G12: Treant's Stand

A limestone-walled ravine cuts into a rise in the land. A stream from the lake wends toward a low cave to the west. Trees, shrubs, and creepers grow near mossy boulders toward the back of the ravine to the east.

A curmudgeonly and venerable treant, Gnarlroot, lives near the cave in the back of the ravine. He watches newcomers from afar and reveals himself only if they damage any plant life or approach his cave. When Gnarlroot emerges, he grumpily tells the characters to respect other people's homes.

---

Hidden Cave. A mossy cave hidden toward the back of the ravine holds a simple table and stool and a rack full of gardening tools. The furniture is for the Gardener's benefit, and both they and Gnarlroot use the tools to tend various plants in the garden. Characters who search the ravine and succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check find the cave behind a curtain of ivy.
What Gnarlroot Knows. Gnarlroot often converses with the Gardener when the archfey stops by. He knows about Juliana and Orlando thanks to a recent visit from the archfey. If the characters agree to get off his lawn, Gnarlroot tells them the paramours were seen gathering leaves throughout the garden before entering the hedge maze (area G21).
Treasure. Hidden in a leather sack under some mossy rocks in the cave is a Potion of Growth. A character searching the cave finds the stash with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check.

## G13: Cave of the Toads

A stream fed by the lake runs into a cave in the southern wall of a limestone ravine. The cave mouth is twenty feet wide and fifteen feet high.

The stream runs into a crack in the rock at the back of the 30 -foot-deep cave. Two giant toads lair in the cave, guarding their clutch of eggs. The toads are indifferent to the characters unless the characters come more than 10 feet into their den, at which point the toads croak angrily in defense of their eggs. A character can use an action to try to calm the toads, doing so with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. Once calmed, the toads allow the characters to explore the cave unhindered. The toads attack if their eggs are threatened.
Treasure. Wedged into the crack where the stream begins is a +1 Shield emblazoned with the image of a brightly painted frog.

## G14: Centaurs' Meadow

A meadow near the lake bursts with color from the wildflowers blanketing the grass. A small wooden structure resembling a cross between a cottage and a stable stands among the blossoms.

Bees buzz happily between the flowers and around a great hive enclosing the rear corner of the structure.

The meadow and structure are home to a family of four centaurs. The parents, Heraq and Persella, are initially wary of the characters and tersely ask
them to state their business. The centaur children, Kari and Vinz, spend most of their time running through the meadows and swimming in the lake with the giant otters (area G18). If the characters are respectful, the centaurs invite them inside for tea sweetened with honey.
The bees are docile unless their hive is damaged. If a creature damages the beehive, a swarm of insects (wasps) erupts from the hive and attacks until the offending creature dies or flees.
Shelter. The centaurs' home has an open-air common room with a large trestle table, cooking utensils, and fresh fruit and nuts. Three bedrooms behind it house the family, two for the children and one for their parents. The rooms are appointed with straw mattresses and lockers containing brushes and simple upper-body clothing.
What the Centaurs Know. Kari and Vinz saw Juliana and Orlando enter the hedge maze (area G21) yesterday, but the couple never returned.
Treasure. A character can carefully harvest a single dose of magical honey from the hive without upsetting the bees with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check. The honey collected functions as a Potion of Vitality.

## G15: Unicorns' Meadow

A rolling, green expanse of grass rises from the east shore of the lake to the color-flecked forest and steep cliff at the domain's eastern border.

Two mated unicorns named Stargleam and Silverlily live here. They enjoy walking the paths of the hedge maze (area G21) and occasionally assist the Gardener in protecting the domain. It's been decades since their help was required, but they remain vigilant and intensely question newcomers to the garden.
What the Unicorns Know. The unicorns are initially standoffish and try to get the measure of anyone pumping them for information with a philosophical debate, such as when it's okay to lie to someone you love. A character who engages the unicorns in their debate and succeeds on a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) or Intelligence (History) check earns the unicorns' grudging respect. Thereafter the unicorns are willing to discuss the garden and its inhabitants, including the entrancing power of the Fountain All Heal (area G9). The unicorns then reveal Juliana and Orlando are under its sway.

---

Walls of thorny hedges stand ten feet high in this meadow. An opening in the west wall leads into an arbor with thriving rose bushes covered in bright yellow roses.

Two hedge-walled arbors mark the east meadow. The northern arbor grows yellow roses, while the southern arbor (area G17) grows red roses.
Hedges. The hedge wall is 5 feet thick and immune to all damage. A creature can force its way through the wall, spending 4 feet of movement for each foot traveled. Creatures that push through a hedge wall must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 31 (7d8) piercing damage from its thorns on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.
Roses. The lovely scent of the roses fills the arbor inside the hedge walls, causing a drowsy euphoria in creatures that inhale it. A creature that breathes the scent must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the poisoned condition for 24 hours. A creature that succeeds on the save is immune to the roses' perfume for 24 hours.
