## NAFIK

In life, Nafik was the high priest of Amun Sa, the last pharaoh of the land of Bakar. Nafik was a loyal subject and was respected in turn by Amun Sa and the lesser priests in the pharaoh's retinue. When Amun Sa died, Nafik and a cadre of priests locked themselves in Amun Sa's tomb according to tradition. There, they performed holy rites and accepted food and offerings from the outside.
As time went on, Nafik grew envious of Amun Sa. "Why should the pharaoh get to enjoy eternal bliss in the afterlife while his priests are condemned to live out the rest of their lives imprisoned in his pyramid?" he thought. In his anger, Nafik turned to unholy grimoires, seeking forbidden rituals he hoped could teach him the secrets of everlasting life.
When the lands of Bakar dried up, the faithful stopped bringing offerings to Amun Sa's tomb. The threat of starvation loomed over Nafik and his priests. In a desperate measure, Nafik wrought a haphazard ritual on himself and his fellow priests, transforming them and himself into Undead. Heartless and corrupted by evil, Nafik now rules over the upper halls of Amun Sa's pyramid and the priests he sentenced to an exanimate eternity.

## PECH

Pechs are slight, bipedal diggers from the Elemental Plane of Earth. They have a knack for finding weak points in buildings, objects, and raw materials, making them phenomenal excavators-and, if the occasion calls for it, sappers and saboteurs. Pechs enjoy sculpting and carving vast networks of tunnels and warrens, where they live in clans and mine precious metals and gems.
Small and lithe, pechs have long, thin limbs and broad feet. Their large, pupilless eyes are sensitive to bright light, which they avoid, and they find sunlight nauseating. Their skin displays a spectrum of color and texture as varied as that of clay, earth, and stone.
A single pech can draw on the magic of the Elemental Plane of Earth to shape stone to its will, but pechs are stronger together than alone. When in groups, pechs can combine their magic to conjure great curtains of stone and infuse creatures with the fortitude of elemental earth.
