![img-4.jpeg](assets/City%20of%20Splendors,%20Waterdeep_img-4.jpeg)  
dcross Faerûn, the name "Waterdeep" evokes feelings of wonder, awe, and envy. Although it is not the largest city in the Realms, the City of Splendors is undoubtedly the most famous and most cosmopolitan metropolis on the continent of Faerûn. Having grown rich on a steady diet of trade and industry, this crossroads city combines the best aspects of many cultures into a marvelous shining jewel. Waterdeep's cultural patrimony is all of Faerûn, and its inhabitants are much richer for it.

The City of Splendors lies in the shadow of Mount Waterdeep on the shore of the best natural harbor along the Sword Coast. Undermountain, the greatest dungeon in all Faerûn, lies beneath the city's streets and sewers, and the untamed hinterlands of the Sword Coast beckon to those daring enough to seek their fortune.

Built on a plateau settled first by the elves of Illefarn and later honeycombed by the shield dwarves of Clan Melairkyn, the City of Splendors was founded by primitive Illuskan and Tethyrian settlers and heavily influenced by far-wandering Chondathan merchants. Today, Waterdeep remains a predominantly human city, although representatives of nearly every intelligent race make their home within its walls.

Waterdeep is home to haughty nobles, diligent craftsmen, scheming merchants, daring sailors, and bold adventurers of every stripe. It has always been a center of wealth and influence where those who dream of power, riches, or artistic fulfillment can come to to realize their aspirations.

It is also a city of fearsome dungeons.  
Undermountain and the Dungeon of the Crypt promise untold riches and deadly monsters to those who dare their  
depths. Skullport, the Port of Shadow, beckons to those who seek illicit goods and dark dearlings. Ancient feuds divide Waterdeep's guilds and noble houses, and many factions seek to topple the secretive Lords of Waterdeep. The Arcane Brotherhood of neighboring Luskan seeks to weaken its hated rival to the south, while the Red Wizards of Thay hope to dominate Waterdeep's markets. The churches of Selûne and Shar use the City of Splendors as a battlefield in their eternal war, while countless mercenary groups come to the city to spend their hard-won earnings. The Shadow Thieves of Amn plot to overthrow the Lords who once drove them out of the city. Spies and mercenaries such as the Knights of the Shield and the Kraken Society spread rumors and steal closely held secrets, while agents of Skullport's Iron Ring prowl for slaves to abduct into the depths. All the while, the secretive Lords of Waterdeep strive to preserve the city's tolerant spirit, wise rule, and powerful magical tradition.

![img-5.jpeg](assets/City%20of%20Splendors,%20Waterdeep_img-5.jpeg)

Although Waterdeep is younger than many cities of the South, its history stretches back millennia. Humans have dwelt along the shores of Deepwater Bay for at least two thousand years, in settlements such as Sargauth, Blackcloak Hold, Bloodhand Hold, Nimoar's Hold, and Skullport, and their traditions, culture, and law form the foundation of Waterdhavian culture and society.

In the current age, the City of Splendors serves as the Gateway to the North, accessible by road, ship, Underdark passage, or magic portal. Almost anything can be bought, sold, or found in its thriving markets and long-forgotten dungeons. Most adventurers worth their salt eventually make their way to Waterdeep in search of excitement, danger, or great reward. The trick is surviving and thriving in the grandest city of Faerún.

Waterdeep (Metropolis, Magical): AL all; Spending limit 100,000 gp; Assets $663,300,000 \mathrm{gp}(3,316,700,000$ in summer months); Population 132,661 within the city limits ( $\times 5$ in summer months); Races mixed (humans $64 \%$, shield dwarves $10 \%$, elves [mostly moon elves] $10 \%$, lightfoot halflings $5 \%$, half-elves $5 \%$, gnomes [all kinds] $3 \%$, half-orcs $2 \%$, others $1 \%$ ).

Authority Figures: Piergeiron Paladinson; Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun; Mirt the Moneylender; other Lords of Waterdeep (see page 52 ).

Important Characters: Elaith "the Serpent" Craulnober (NE male moon elf fighter 3/wizard 9, crime lord detailed on page 182 of the Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting); Halaster Blackcloak (male human wizard 25/archmage 5 of unknown heritage, Master Mage of Undermountain, detailed on page 180 of the Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting, updated in Epic Level Handbook, page 294); Laeral Silverhand Arunsun  
(Lady Mage of Waterdeep, see page 25); hundreds more (too numerous to list here).

Notable Exports: Ale, arms, cloth, furnishings, leather goods, pottery, refined metals, and all other sorts of finished goods.

### History of Waterdeep

Deepwater Bay is the best harbor along the Sword Coast, and the plateau in the shadow of Mount Waterdeep is a natural site on which to build a city. Elves, dwarves, Netherese wizards, Illuskan seafarers, and Tethyrian migrants have all laid claim to what is now the city of Waterdeep at various points in time.

The following is a brief accounting of that history, detailing the major settlements that have existed on and beneath the plateau of Waterdeep.

### Aelinthaldaar (-8500 to -1100 DR)

The first known settlement in the area was Aelinthaldaar, capital city of Illefarn. Founded around -8500 DR, Aelinthaldaar was razed by 'elven high magic in -1100 DR on the order of Illefarn's coronal when he initiated a retreat to Evermeet. Virtually nothing was left to indicate that an elf city had stood on the site for seven millennia.

In -1088 DR, scarcely a dozen years after the razing of Aelinthaldaar, annual trade began between southern merchants and barbaric local tribes. The only known traces of Aelinthaldaar that still exist today are the crypts beneath the Pantheon Temple of the Seldarine (C66) and a high magic effect that persists even today (described in the next section).

### Melairbode (-1288 to 211 DR)

Even before the Fair Folk abandoned Aelinthaldaar, a shield dwarf named Melair discovered a vein of precious mithral beneath Mount Waterdeep in -1288 DR. King Melair I, as he came to be known, sent word to his kindred, and those who

---

answered his call became Clan Melairkyn. The Melairkyn were traders, artisans, and explorers, strongly protective of their home, which they named the Underhalls of Melairbode. They slew or drove off Underdark predators, duergar miners, and drow scouts in order to establish their realm.

As the Melairkyn extended the boundaries of their realm to include the topmost levels of what is now Undermountain, the leaders of Aelinthaldaar grew increasingly concerned. Eventually a deal was struck, in which the Melairkyn would provide a great amount of mithral ore to the elves. In exchange, the elves crafted a high magic effect that would prevent the plateau from ever collapsing or settling, no matter what occurred in the tunnels below. The plateau of Waterdeep still stands firm today, despite countless collapses in the caverns of Melairbode in the intervening centuries.

### Sargauth Enclave ( -750 to -339 DR )

In -750 DR , an order of powerful Netherese mages claimed a section of rock amid Melairbode that the Stout Folk had not yet begun to excavate. Some claim the Netherese sought the protection of the lingering magics of Aelinthaldaar, while others believe they deliberately placed themselves in the midst of a rich dwarf kingdom so that the Stout Folk would serve as a buffer against invaders. Be that as it may, the Sargauth Enclave was hewn by Netherese spells and then sealed against dwarf intrusions before the Melairkyn could even protest the presence of these unwanted neighbors.

For more than four centuries, the Stout Folk and the Netherese arcanists lived side-by-side as unfriendly neighbors. The Netherese experimented on and expanded the mantle magic of the elves, creating a great mantle akin to a mytbal to encompass their entire enclave. While just as committed to magic, the people of this enclave embraced gods as well, unlike other powerful Netherese mages. Their temples were incredible constructs of magic and stone. (See pages 111-112 of Lost Empires of Faerûn for more information on mantles.)

In the Year of Sundered Webs ( -339 DR ), the temporary collapse of the Weave that destroyed the flying cities of Netheril left the ceiling of the Sargauth Enclave temporarily without magical support. More than two-thirds of the enclave collapsed, leaving the area (the current Level Three of Undermountain) in ruins. The survivors were twisted into magically potent undead that survive to this day as the Skulls of Skullport (see page 109).

### Kyoclamshin ( -677 to 493 DR )

In the Year of Fervent Glances ( -677 DR ), drow from the city of Karsoluthiyl (located beneath the Trackless Sea, west of the mouth of the River Chionthar) began their first incursions against the Stout Folk of Melairbode. After centuries of inconclusive skirmishing, the drow mustered a huge army in the Year of Purloined Power ( 34 DR ) and swarmed up from the depths, overwhelming the shield dwarves and slaying King Melair IV, the last clan chief of the Melairkyn. The dwarves were forced to retreat to successively lower and less important  
levels of the Underhalls, until they finally vanished in the Year of Spoiled Splendors (211 DR).

The drow named their new holdings Kyorlamshin and claimed most of fallen Melairbode as their demesne. They established a chain of portals linking Kyorlamshin's central temple with Karsoluthiyl and began regular slaving runs between the Northdark and the more southerly Realms Below.

### Buathym Diaspora ( 52 to 108 DR)

In the century leading up to the beginning of Dalereckoning, the ancient kingdom of Ruathym was wracked by intertribal strife, which in turn prompted a wave of emigration. One Ruathymite tribe, known as the Illuskans, settled at the mouth of the River Delimbiyr, founding the city of Tavaray in the Year of the Phandar ( -50 DR ).

While the various Illuskan island settlements either dwindled and died or grew into tiny kingdoms, the Illuskans of Tavaray prospered and began expanding their holdings. From the mouth of the River Delimbiyr, the Illuskan settlement spread upriver and north along the coast. By the Year of the Thundering Horde ( 52 DR ), Illuskans were farming the plateau above Deepwater Harbor, and for two and a half centuries their rule of the area was uncontested.

### Blackcloak Hold ( 168 to 482 DR )

In the Year of Scattered Stars ( 168 DR ), a wizard of unknown ancestry calling himself Halaster Blackcloak built a tower and fortified ramparts in the middle of the Deepwater Plateau, to the north and west of the burgeoning farms along the harbor shore. Halaster quickly convinced the local populace to leave him and his apprentices, known as the Seven, alone, and then retreated into his new stronghold.

Unbeknownst to the local populace, Halaster Blackcloak had built the hold as a secure base from which to explore the Underhalls of the Melairkyn and claim the delvings for himself. Halaster's Hunts-held at various times from 171 DR to 308 DR -brutally exterminated large pockets of drow and duergar, driving them out of the Underhalls, as they had previously done to the dwarves. Halaster ruled the Underhalls by the Year of the Cascade ( 309 DR ), and the drow, forced into the lowest levels of the Underhalls, abandoned the former dwarfhome entirely by the Year of the Ecstatic Priest ( 493 DR ).

Meanwhile, the Seven left Halaster's Hold in the Year of Sundered Sails ( 307 DR ), hoping to establish their own holdings in the depths. The tower and surface holding fell into decay and ruin, and the tribes of Blackcloak Hold, as the settlement had come to be known, quickly learned to avoid this "cursed" enclosure.

In the Year of the Deep Bay ( 302 DR ), the inhabitants of Tavaray were forced to abandon their city by the rising waters of the Lizard Marsh. This event marked the waning of Illuskan influence along the coast south of the Sword Mountains. Cut off from the lower Delimbiyr Vale by the Ardeep Forest, Blackcloak Hold entered a long period of decline, and its population fragmented into tribes split along what had once been clan lines.

### Bloodhand Hold ( 482 to 882 DR)

In the Year of the Blighted Vine ( 482 DR), a Tethyrian warlord named Ulbaerag Bloodhand conquered the ever-feuding, settled tribes of Blackcloak Hold. Within a generation, Ulbaerag had united the tribes as one. The settlement served as a small but important anchorage on the Sword Coast, visited annually by ships seeking timber harvested by the inhabitants of Bloodhand Hold.

The rising power of orc hordes in the North led to the Council of Axe and Arrow in the Year of Trials Arcane ( 723 DR). There, the humans of Delimbiyran, the dwarves of Dardath, the elves of Ardeep Forest, the gnomes of Dolblunde, and displaced halflings from Mieritin collectively founded the Tri-Crowned Kingdom of Phalorm. The aging Ulbaerag rejected an invitation to join the Realm of Three Crowns. However, Ulbaerag's son and successor proved more pragmatic, forging a lasting peace with the elves of the Ardeep Forest.

The Realm of Three Crowns lasted less than a century, falling in the Year of the Lamia's Kiss ( 617 DR) to waves of goblinoid attacks. The final battles between Phalorm and the Horde of the Wastes resulted in the magical inundation of Uthtower (forming the Mere of Dead Men) and the overrunning of the Sword Mountains by countless bands of orcs. Many warriors of Bloodhand Hold died in the fighting as well, but their sacrifice ensured the safety of their home.

In the wake of the Fallen Kingdom's collapse, the humans of Delimbiyran founded the human-ruled Kingdom of Man. For fifty-five years the armies of Delimbiyran waged an "Endless Battle" against the scattered orc tribes of the Sword Coast, indirectly shielding the folk of Bloodhand Hold from their depredations. Although Ulbaerag's descendants retained their nominal independence, Bloodhand Hold was considered by most to be just an outlying village of the Kingdom of Man.

The death of Delimbiyr's heirless king in the Year of the Triton's Horn ( 697 DR) plunged the Kingdom of Man into an ill-timed civil war. Bloodhand Hold was one of the few small states to survive the internecine conflict and the subsequent orc assault. In the Year of the Splendid Stag ( 734 DR), a succession of harvests wrecked by fierce summer storms drove Raulbaera Bloodhand, a descendant of Ulbaerag, to lead a band of followers inland in search of a more sheltered vale. The "Maiden King" laid claim to the lands near present-day Amphail, establishing a settlement there that she named Rowan Hold.

### Nimoar's Hold (882 to 932 DR)

Great changes swept the North in the Year of the Curse (882 DR). The fall of Ascalhorn, Eaerlann, and Ammarindar to demons prompted a great migration of dwarves, elves, and humans south and west toward the coast. Among the migrants arose a great human warrior known as Nimoar the Reaver. Nimoar gathered an armed host and led them in search of a new home.

As winter drew nigh, Nimoar and his followers came upon Bloodhand Hold and decided to seize it for their own. They quickly vanquished the Bloodhand tribe. Nimoar immediately  
ordered the construction of a log palisade atop an earthen embankment and a wooden fortress at the northern end of the settlement.

Nimoar's defenses were seriously tested in the decade that followed. In the Year of Fell Pearls ( 887 DR), southern pirates attacked Nimoar's Hold in force, but the Reaver's followers beat them back three times in a row. In the Year of the Shining Shield ( 889 DR), driven from the lower Dessarin vale by the same pressures that had prodded Nimoar and his followers, the Tethyrian Bull Elk tribe attacked Nimoar's Hold and set it afire. However, once again the Reaver's followers proved victorious, driving off the barbarian raiders and rebuilding the hold before the first winter snow.

From then onward, Nimoar's Hold grew and prospered, and the fledgling community became known among ship captains as the "town of Waterdeep."

### Age of War Lords (932 to 1032 DR)

After some four decades of peace, two threats arose to challenge Waterdeep's prosperity-orcs and trolls. In the Year of the Red Rain ( 927 DR), a shaman named Wund arose among the orc tribes of the Sword Mountains. On the eve of the Feast of the Moon, as Wund had prophesied, blood red thunderclouds engulfed the Sword Mountains. For three days the slopes ran wet with blood, leaving behind the sickening stench of rot and decay. All manner of plagues quickly swept through the region. Many orcs (and other folk) died by the White Hand of Yutrus, including every tribal chieftain, but the spawn of Gruumsh who survived the crucible of plagues grew stronger.

In the immediate aftermath of the Blood Plagues, Wund established a monastic order known as the Brotherhood of the Scarlet Scourge. Members of the order organized the surviving orc tribes into a united realm under the spiritual guidance of the brotherhood. The most powerful chieftain, a massive, fairly unintelligent tusker named Uruth, was crowned king by Wund.

The first signs of Waterdeep's impending peril unfolded in the Year of Fireslaughter ( 932 DR). Gangs of trolls, driven out of the Sword Mountains by the orc tribes of the region, began attacking Nimoar's Hold with increasing regularity. In response, the aging Nimoar led his forces northward against the Everlasting Ones in what became known as the First Trollwar, burning miles of land bare in the process.

In the Year of the Sky Raiders ( 936 DR), the armies of Uruth Ukrypt swept down the eastern slopes of the Sword Mountains. The armies of Waterdeep battled the orcs of Uruth Ukrypt in a series of pitched battles known as the Orcfastings War. Early orc victories in the Battle of Whirling Blades, the Battle of Sarcrag, and the Battle of Withered Fields drove Waterdeep's forces back to the gates of Nimoar's Hold. However, a timely feint by the Duke of Calandor enabled Nimoar's forces to break the orcs' siege of the hold in the Battle of Burning Cliffs.

Over the next five days, Waterdeep's armies won four successive battles, shattering the might of Uruth Ukrypt's armies. King Uruth fell in the Battle of the Westwood, but it was the death of Wund that precipitated the Horderout.

---

In the aftermath of the Orcfastings War, Nimoar died of old age, and the mantle of "War Lord" passed to Gharl, his most accomplished general. The orcs of Uruth Ukrypt retreated to their high steadings. Orc plans to attack Waterdeep in the Year of Cold Claws ( 940 DR) faltered thanks to Palarandusk, a great gold wyrm. This proved fortunate for the defenders of Waterdeep, for once again the Everlasting Ones began raiding, marking the beginning of the Second Trollwar.

For a dozen years, the defenders of Waterdeep battled gangs of trolls throughout the Dessarin River valley. Beginning with Amphail the Just, who reigned for a year, six warriors claimed the mantle of War Lord of Waterdeep during this period, only to fall in never-ending battle with the trolls.

In the Year of the Rings Royal ( 952 DR), the human realms and holdings of the North united and finally ended the war, destroying or scattering the hordes of Everlasting Ones. Two heroes of that war were Ahghairon, thereafter recognized as the premier wizard of the Savage North, and Samular Caradoon, a Tyrran knight who attracted a large following to his banner. In the aftermath of the war, Ahghairon was elevated to the position of official advisor of the War Lord of Waterdeep, and Samular went on to form the Holy Order of Samular, a knighthood still active in Waterdeep to this day.

After fighting and winning three wars in the span of two decades, the city of Waterdeep emerged as a preeminent power in the North. Construction of Castle Waterdeep began in the Year of the Deadly Duo ( 963 DR), just north of the city walls. Over the next decade, the city's walls were expanded to abut the wall around the ruins of Halaster's Hold and replaced  
with high stone fortifications. In the Year of the Haunting Harpy ( 974 DR), the castle was finally completed and Laroun, Waterdeep's first female War Lord, took residence therein.

Laroun ruled long and well, seeing to Waterdeep's continued prosperity and defense. By the Year of the Bold Barbarian (1007 DR), the city walls had been expanded once again, absorbing the ruins of Halaster's Hold, cloaked in wards by Ahghairon. Waterdeep's master mage also built his tower in this year, at the time outside the city's walls. In the Year of Three Signs (1010 DR), Laroun officially established the Free City of Waterdeep, with herself as "Warlord" (or ruler).

In the Year of Lathander's Light (1024 DR), a daring band of Waterdhavian adventurers known as the Dawnbringer Company incited the orcs of Uruth Ukrypt by plundering their sacred crypt, known as the Ukrypt. Discovered in the act, the band fled the wrath of the Scarlet Scourge. In response, the Brotherhood of the Scarlet Scourge mustered the first orc horde in generations to emerge from the Sword Mountains. Bent on destroying the City of Splendors, the Broken Bone horde instead fell prey to Lhammaruntosz, the "Claws of the Coast."

Enraged by its defeat, the Brotherhood of the Scarlet Scourge plotted revenge against the city of Waterdeep. In the Year of Crimson Magics ( 1026 DR), the Brotherhood mustered another orc horde from the depths of the Sword Mountains. The Black Claw horde encircled the plateau on which the city lay and then repeatedly assaulted the City of Splendors. Warlord Laroun died defending Waterdeep during one of the desperate battles to hold the city's walls.  
![img-6.jpeg](assets/City%20of%20Splendors,%20Waterdeep_img-6.jpeg)

---

Laroun's title passed to Raurlor, leader of the city's army, despite the reservations of Ahghairon. The Black Claw horde would have undoubtedly overrun the City of Splendors if not for the daring of an elite company of veterans who traveled through Halaster's Underhalls; beyond the city walls, and then fell on the orc encampment from the rear. The defeats of two successive hordes shattered both the kingdom of Uruth Ukrypt and the order, that sustained it. The orcs of the Sword Mountains disintegrated into warring tribes.

In the Year of Warlords ( 1030 DR), Raurlor began to increase Waterdeep's standing army and navy to a size not seen since the fall of Phalorm. Over the next two years, he turned the city into a garrison and military encampment, brooking no dissent from the populace. In the Year of the Nightmaidens (1032 DR), Raurlor proclaimed the Empire of the North, but Ahghairon defied him, transforming the Warlord's blade into a viper that poisoned its wielder; Raurlor died at the mage's feet, and Ahghairon took power.

### Age of Ahghairon ( 1032 to 1256 DR)

As the first "Lord" of Waterdeep, Ahghairon determined that henceforth wisdom and not armed might would rule in the city. He assembled a group of Lords drawn from all walks of life, masked and disguised when they appeared to the people, but equal to him in authority. In the years that followed, Waterdeep prospered, growing in both size and economic might. The System of Wards came into being in the Year of Falling Stars (1035 DR), initially including Castle Ward, Trades Ward, Temple (later Southern) Ward, and Dock Ward.

The Year of Lions' Roars ( 1071 DR) saw the noted adventurer Ranressa Shiard return to the slopes of Mount Waterdeep on dragonback, astride a copper wyrm named Galadaeros, prompting Ahghairon to create wards deterring (but not completely preventing) dragons from raiding the city. In the winter of the Year of the Defiant Salute ( 1076 DR), Waterdeep was attacked by the Tethyrian Black Boar tribe of the Dessarin, led by Nalethra of the Winged Spear. Repelled from the city's walls, the princess and her bodyguard slew thrice their number of'Waterdhavian fighters before they fell.

A great plague swept the Sword Coast in the Year of the Scourge ( 1150 DR), coupled with increased attacks by troll and orc tribes. Large numbers of Waterdhavians died from these twin scourges, thanks in part to the treachery of a secret cult of Talona, quickly destroyed by agents of the Lords. The same year saw the arrival of Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun the Elder, who built Arunsun (later Blackstaff) Tower for himself and his apprentices.

In the Year of the Black Horde (1235 DR), Waterdeep and much of the Sword Coast was besieged by the largest orc horde in history. The city was spared the destruction visited on its neighbors when Ahghairon and his generals introduced griffons as flying steeds for the army. The Year of Burning Steel (1246 DR) saw Kerrigan, a wizard and hidden Lord of Waterdeep, attempt to seize power for himself. He managed to fell three of his fellow Lords and a score of innocents before being slain by Ahghairon.

### Skullport (iI4B DR to present)

In the Year of the Angry Sea ( 1148 DR), a Netherese wizard named Shradin Mulophor discovered the ruins of the Sargauth Enclave and petitioned the Lord of the Underhalls for permission to settle and use the ruin-filled chamber as his personal demesne. The Lord of Bones, as Shradin came to be known, encouraged trade with other Underdark powers by linking the River Sargauth with subterranean waterways and creating portals leading to distant seas.

Fear of the necromancer's magical powers, combined with the mysterious Skulls that lent Skullport its name, fostered peaceful trading within the port's environs. Within twenty-five years of its rediscovery, Skullport had grown into a secure settlement, and smugglers, slavers, assassins, thieves, and buccaneers flocked to the Port of Shadow to conduct their business.

Ever since, Skullport has flourished beneath Waterdeep in large part due to the tolerance of the city's Lords. Most of the city's rulers are or have been realistic enough to admit that dark deeds occur in every large city and that by giving them an outlet in the Port of Shadow they are reducing the incidence of such activities in the City of Splendors. Shradin himself continued to explore the Underhalls, but after once such expedition in the Year of the Howling Hourglass ( 1184 DR), he returned to Skullport a changed man, unstable and unpredictable. Although he retained the mantle of Lord of Bones, he no longer commanded the fear and respect he once had. During Halaster's Higharvestide in the Year of the Gauntlet ( 1369 DR), the Skulls of Skullport ganged up and destroyed him. Although a lesser clone of the necromancer eventually reappeared, the Skulls have ruled the Port of Shadow ever since.

### Reign of Guildmasters ( 1256 to 1273 DR)

In the Year of the Dusty Throne ( 1256 DR), shortly after Khelben vanished from the City of Splendors, the aged Ahghairon passed away and was interred with great ceremony in his tower, which was then sealed with potent wards that remain in effect to this very day. Ahghairon's fellow Lords were nowhere to be found, as all but two had been quietly slain in the wake of Ahghairon's death, leaving the masters of Waterdeep's various guilds (who had secretly discovered the identities of the hidden Lords and had them killed) to argue over who should rule.

While the council bickered, deadly strife erupted in the city's shadows. The Guild Wars pitted armies of hired mercenaries and assassins against one another, wiping out many merchant families. After two months, it was agreed that the Council of Guildmasters would collectively rule the City of Splendors, although most of the feuds spawned during this era have never been forgotten.

In the Year of the Black Wind ( 1262 DR), six years of self-interested squabbling among the Guildmasters erupted into bloodshed. All but two of the city's Guildmasters died in the next few months. The surviving Guildmasters, Lhorar Gildeggh of the Shipwrights and Ehlemm Zoar of the Gemcutters, finally sickened of the bloodshed and agreed to rule together as Lords

---

Magister, although their continued bickering prevented any effective governance of the city.

In the same year the Lords Magister began their rule, the Shadow Thieves, up till then a minor band of thieves openly tolerated as a recognized guild, discovered a long-forgotten stronghold in the depths of Mount Waterdeep built by the dwarves of Melairbode and used as a defensive retreat during the era of Bloodhand Hold. Calling their new stronghold the Citadel of the Bloody Hand, the Shadow Thieves quickly grew in strength and influence, free to flourish in the climate of lawlessness that prevailed.

The reign of the Guildmasters came to an abrupt end in the Year of the Wagon ( 1273 DR), when the last two of Ahghairon's Lords appeared in the court of the Lords Magister. Lady Shilarn, apprentice and undeclared heir of Ahghairon, blasted Lhorar and Ehlemm with lightning and fire. Lord Baeron Silmaeril removed his mask and declared himself Open Lord of Waterdeep.

### Reign of BACrion ( 1273 to 1308 DR)

The revival of the Lords' Rule saw a gradual return to peace and prosperity in the City of Splendors, although many worked in secret to oppose Baeron Silmaeril and the masked Shilarn Silmaeril as they reestablished their authority. Among their first acts, Shilarn declared Houses Gildeggh and Zoar to be outcast, while Baeron established the black-robed Magisters to maintain justice and outlawed the Shadow Thieves from the city.

Within three years of their installation, the wedded Lords Silmaeril had chosen fourteen additional individuals to serve as hidden Lords of Waterdeep, although only five to seven were ever seen at once. In the Year of the Crumbling Keep (1276 DR), the Lords expanded the city's borders to include North Ward and Sea Ward, and Shilarn gave birth to a daughter named Lhestyn.

In the guise of the "Masked Lady," Lhestyn infiltrated the outlawed Shadow Thieves in the Year of the Pointed Bone ( 1298 DR) and exposed their continuing activities. This act precipitated a bloody tenday of fighting between the guild and the City Watch that culminated in the death or flight of the guild's members. Two years later, Lhestyn wed Zelphar Arunsun, a Neverwintan wizard and youngest son of Khelben the Elder, and two years after that ( 1302 DR ) she gave birth to Khelben "Ravenscloak" Arunsun the Younger, a near twin of his grandfather and namesake.

In the same year that saw the birth of Lhestyn's only child, two noted adventurers, Durnan and Mirt the Merciless, emerged from Undermountain bearing great wealth, precipitating a renewal of interest in the vast dungeon beneath the City of Splendors. The practice of exiling criminals to the depths of Undermountain dates back to this year, although some have begun to question its effectiveness, as it seems to ensure that only the most dangerous predators of the city survive, often strengthened by the crucible of Halaster's Halls.

Baeron died of fever in the Year of the Catacombs (1308 DR), and Shilarn, his wife, immolated herself on his funeral  
pyre. Their daughter, Lhestyn, a hidden Lord of Waterdeep herself, became the city's Open Lord.

### Reign of Lhestyn (1308 to 1314 DR)

Lhestyn's short reign as Open Lord of Waterdeep began in splendor but was marked by personal tragedy. In the Year of the Catacombs ( 1308 DR), Lhestyn constructed the Palace of Waterdeep on the site of a ruined abbey of Chauntea. In the Year of the Fist ( 1311 DR), her husband Zelphar was crushed to death by a sorcerous hand of force. The perpetrator remains unknown to the Lords to this day (in truth, he was murdered by a lich of the Twisted Rune as a favor to the Shadow Thieves).

Zelphar's death prompted Durnan, himself a hidden Lord, to found the Red Sashes as his personal agents, creating a precaution against blatant disregard for the watch that had grown increasingly common in Dock Ward. Khelben the Elder secretly returned to Arunsun Tower after the death of his son, phasing out and eventually faking the "death" of his guise as Ducat Eattel by the following year. Over the next ten years, he trained his grandson and namesake, as it gradually became known that Khelben the Younger now claimed his "grandfather's" tower.

Lhestyn died in the Year of the Shadowtop ( 1314 DR), only a few short years after her parents and husband. Piergeiron Paladinson, a paladin and officer of the city guard whom Lhestyn had made a hidden Lord three years earlier, became Open Lord of Waterdeep. Khelben the Younger departed Waterdeep in the Year of Chains ( 1321 DR), leaving his grandfather to assume his guise.

### Reign of Piergeiron ( 1314 DR to present)

Since ascending to the position of Open Lord of Waterdeep, Piergeiron Paladinson has reigned wisely and honestly. In his first four decades, Waterdeep knew peace, with only one exception. The Year of the Saddle ( 1345 DR) saw religious strife between the church of Shar and the churches of Lathander, Selúne, and Tempus. This conflict resulted in the fiery destruction of two of the city's temples-the Spires of the Morning and the House of Heroes-during the "Night of Temple Fires" and the sacking of a third-a hidden temple of the Dark Maiden beneath what is now Shadows Alley.

The era of peace ended in the Year of the Harp ( 1355 DR), when Amril Zoar, scion of the exiled Waterdhavian family of the same name, slew two secret Lords of Waterdeep, Lady Tamaeril Bladesemmer and Resengar the Whitebeard, and badly wounded Open Lord Piergeiron. After being apprehended, he was spared execution by the intercession of Storm Silverhand of the Harpers.

In the first days of the Year of the Worm ( 1356 DR), a Waterdhavian troop patrolling the trade routes came under attack by devils and goblins in the Open Marches. The devils were tracked back to Dragonspear Castle, where Waterdeep's forces besieged and set fire to the ancient keep. The Dragonspear War continued for months, as the numbers of devils continued to grow.

![img-7.jpeg](assets/City%20of%20Splendors,%20Waterdeep_img-7.jpeg)

The attack of Myrkul's Legion  
months leading up to Midsummer, culminating in the disruption of Shieldmeet by a green dragon (Grimnoshtadrano, the Riddling Dragon of the High Forest) and an apparently mad bard (an ex-Harper named Iriador "Garnet" Wintermist), nearly upsetting the Lords' Rule.

In the Year of the Shield ( 1367 DR), Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun unmasked himself and resigned as a Lord of Waterdeep, to the surprise of the populace and his fellow Lords. Autumn of the Year of the Banner ( 1368 DR) saw the cream of Waterdhavian youth enlist in Prince Haedrak's Reclamation Army to restore Tethyr's monarchy. At the same time, a fad for dream spheres secretly created by the Mhaorkiira Hadryad swept the City of Splendors, appealing to the increasing ranks of those who dreamt of a better life but despaired of ever achieving it. Complications from the latter episode resulted in the deaths or disappearance of several nobles and nearly rent asunder the seven families of the Two-Cities Consortium who secretly controlled trade between Waterdeep and Skullport.

Two events stood out in the Year of the Gauntlet ( 1369 DR). First, on the last day of Ches, an army of sea creatures led by the monstrous wereshark named Iakhovas invaded the City of Splendors from the depths of the harbor and surrounding sea. Waterdeep's defenders won the Deepwater War, but at the cost of many lives and much destruction in Dock Ward and Sea Ward. Moreover, some number of sea creatures escaped into Waterdeep's sewers and lurk there still. Second, Halaster's Higharvestide disrupted the Mad Mage's wards and released all manner of monsters into the city's streets through malfunctioning portals across the city, causing

---

a great deal of property damage, particularly in Castle Ward and Trades Ward.

Waterdeep's armies were drawn into war once again in the Year of Wild Magic ( 1372 DR), after the phaerimms escaped the Sharnwall and attacked Evereska. Khelben Arunsun led one army that became trapped within the Vale of Evereska, so Laeral and Storm Silverhand led a relief army against the thornbacks and their minions, battling armies of bugbears and lizardfolk thralls led by beholder and illithid generals. An uneasy alliance with the Shadovar of Shade fell apart, and it soon became clear that the Nethorese shades were melting the High Ice of Anauroch, with no thought as to the consequences for the rest of Toril. After months of war, the phaerimms were defeated and the plans of the Shadovar were disrupted by the theft of the Kursestone. Nevertheless, western Faerûn continues to be beset by drought, threatening the prosperity of the City of Splendors and its allies for years to come.

### What the Ruture Holds

Since the Year of the Worm ( 1356 DR), Waterdeep has been invaded by two armies (Myrkul's Legion and the Army of Iakhovas), fought three wars beyond its walls, and had magically induced climatological changes devastate its agricultural environs twice. At the same time, Waterdeep's trusted leaders have grown old or turned to other projects. Folk such as Durnan, Mirt, and Piergeiron are now far beyond their hale and hearty youth, and Khelben is focused on personal projects such as the Tel Teukiira.

With its treasuries nearly drained, its populace exhausted, and severe droughts still ravaging the North, the City of Splendors has acquired a dark patina of despair and penury unseen since the misrule of the Guildmasters. Undoubtedly Waterdeep will rise again, filling its coffers with trade wealth and proudly serving as the Gateway to the North, but for now at least, the City of (faded) Splendors is greatly in need of adventurers to restore its glory once again.

### Who's Who in Waterdeep

The City of Splendors is home to over one hundred thousand citizens, growing to five times that number in the summer months. Among the city's vast numbers, a handful of individuals have achieved particular prominence.

Piergeiron the Paladinson, the Open Lord of Waterdeep, and twenty hidden Lords of Waterdeep rule the City of Splendors. Notable Lords include Brian the Swordmaster, Durnan the Wanderer, "Kitten" Nymara Scheiron, Larissa Neathal, and Mirt the Moneylender. The City Guard, the City Watch (led by Captain Rulathon), and the Gray Hands (led by the ranger Jardwim) enforce the rule of the Lords.

The influential merchant nobility controls much of the city's wealth and wields a great deal of power behind the scenes. Most common merchants and craftsmen are members of one of the city's guilds. Prominent guilds include the

Council of Musicians, Instrument-Makers, Choristers, the Order of Master Shipwrights, and the Watchful Order of Magists \& Protectors.

Although religion does not play a major role in Waterdeep's culture or (aside from the Church of Tyr) government, most known faiths are represented by at least a handful of worshipers within the city's walls. The major acknowledged faiths include the Churches of Gond, Lathander, Mystra, Oghma, Selûne, Siamorphe, Sune, Tempus, Tymora, and Tyr. The churches of Loviatar and Shar and cults of Ghaunadaur and Ibrandul also play prominent roles from the shadows.

Many powerful arcane spellcasters have settled in Waterdeep, drawn by the combination of resources and freedom found in the City of Splendors. Noted archmages include Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun, Laeral Silverhand Arunsun, Halaster Blackcloak, Kappiyan Flurmastyr, Tessalar Hulicorm, Muiral, Maaril, Marune, Savengriff, and Trobriand "the Metal Mage." Famed bards include Danilo Thann and the Masked Minstrel.

Waterdeep's wealth has also attracted a host of black-hearted rogues, including lone agents such as Alauneth "Black Viper" Orrane, Elaith Craulnober, and Zabbas Thuul, and guilds such as the Shadow Thieves and the Xanathar Thieves Guild. Spy guilds such as the Knights of the Shield and the Kraken Society flourish here as well, as do various bands of predatory monsters, including the beholders of the Graypeaks Hive, the Savants of the Dark Tide, and the Unseen.

### Culture and Society

As Gateway to the North, cosmopolitan Waterdeep is home to all manner of individuals, some of them native to the city and some of them hailing from distant lands. Humans make up the bulk ( $64 \%$ ) of the populace, but representatives of nearly every race or ethnic group native to Faerûn dwell within the city walls. Elves (predominantly moon elves) and shield dwarves make up $10 \%$ each of the population, while lightfoot halflings and half-elves makes up $5 \%$ each of the population. Gnomes, at $3 \%$, and half-orcs, at $2 \%$, are the remaining racial minorities found in sizable numbers.

Waterdhavian culture and society derives most strongly from Chondathan, Illuskan, and Tethyrian influences. (The ethnic make-up of Waterdeep's human population is Tethyrian [51\%], Illuskan [23\%], Chondathan [22\%], Calishite [2\%], other [2\%].) Waterdeep's maritime heritage can be traced back to the Illuskan sailors who first anchored on the shores of Deepwater Bay. The city's tolerance and egalitarianism is the legacy of Tethyrian settlers whose forebears have always rebelled against empires and domination. Chondathan merchants imparted a strong mercantile streak into the city's culture in recent centuries and left a legacy of Chondathan as the primary tongue.

Waterdhavians tend to be talkative, friendly, easygoing, and outspoken. Most are slow to take offense or fright and are relatively worldly compared to their counterparts in less cosmopolitan cities. Lecherous and drunken behavior is usually tolerated but considered unusual. Small talk often centers on matters of commerce and warfare elsewhere in Faerûn.

---

Waterdhavians are generally proud of their history but not dismissive of other realms. With important exceptions, they dream of wealth and individual aggrandizement, but eschew thoughts of empire and conquest.

In keeping with the tolerance shown to outsiders, all forms of dress and appearance are seen on the streets of Waterdeep, though impersonating a Lord of Waterdeep, a black-robed Magister, or officers or members of the city guard or watch is forbidden. Guild livery is reserved for guild members, but only worn on official business, holidays, extra-city business ventures, and during guild meetings. Coats of arms can only be worn by those so entitled; nobles rarely display them except in signet rings, belt buckles, or pendants, but their servants wear clothes emblazoned with their masters' coats-of-arms. For women dressing in high fashion, glittering, diaphanous gowns of silk and sequins accompanied by glittering jewelry are much in favor, as are furs and filigreed stomachers in exquisite designs.

### Laws and Punishment

Legal authority in the City of Splendors rests within the Open Lord and the hidden Lords of Waterdeep. The Lord's Court is chaired by Piergeiron, and is attended by at least two other Lords and two Magisters. The Lord's Court hears all "severe" crimes, including suspicious deaths, rape, misuse of magic, and succession and inheritance disputes.

Twenty-six appointed black-robed Magisters conduct the Common Courts of Waterdeep. Three "Black Robes" are always on duty at the Palace. During daylight hours, a Magister is also posted at each gate. Magisters can pass sentence instantly, but most sentences are conditional on the supporting evidence of witnesses. Magisters are always accompanied by at least six members of the city guard. Any citizen of Waterdeep can appeal to the Lord's Court within two days of being sentenced by a Magister, but most such appeals fail. There is no bail in Waterdeep, and barristers are barred from working in the city (although counsel from "professional witnesses" is grudgingly tolerated).

Waterdhavians are largely law-abiding, and most of Waterdeep's laws remain unwritten, within the "reasonable discretion"  
of the Magisters (and thus the Lords who oversee them). The Code Legal serves as a basis for sentencing, dividing all crimes into four Plaints and each Plaint into severe, serious, lesser, and minor offenses.  
The first Plaint involves Crimes Against the Lords (treason, impersonation, forgery of official documents, destruction of city property, assault, willful disobedience of edicts, and blasphemy against a government official). The second Plaint involves Crimes Against the City (poisoning of wells, murder, spying, sabotage, fraud, fencing, unlawful dueling, bribery, unlawful entry into the city, vagrancy, littering, brandishing a weapon without cause, and reckless driving). The third Plaint involves Crimes Against the Gods (defiling of a holy place, theft of temple goods, tomb-robbing, assault on a religious person, public blasphemy of a god or priesthood, and disorderly conduct at worship). The fourth Plaint involves Crimes Against Citizens (arson, rape, bodily harm, magical assault, forgery, slavery, robbery, burglary, theft/killing of livestock, usury, property damage, assault, hindrance of business, and excessive noise).

Slavery is illegal within the city, and slaves brought into the city are considered free. Selling slaves within the wall is forbidden and strictly policed. Weapons can be worn openly and used in self-defense, but brandishing weapons in other situations is a crime. Waterdhavians also expect debts to be paid in full, even if that means the debtor must serve a form of indentured servitude to the creditor (in the case of small debts) or the city (in the case of large debts).

Duels (for reasons of specific, unprovoked injury) are legal only in specific places, but must be marshaled by a member of the Watch or a Magister. Lords, Magisters, guard and watch members, and Heralds are exempt from challenges, and the Lords forbid most duels involving heads of guilds, noble houses, or priesthoods. Most importantly, duels are rarely to the death.

Sentences for lawbreaking include instant death, death upon conviction, exile, mutilation, hard labor, imprisonment (dungeon), imprisonment (light work in castle compound), fine (payable to city), or damages (payable to injured party). Perjury, adjudicated by magic, is punished by expulsion from the city. Death sentences vary by station-commoners and soldiers are

## Read All About it

Only the most wealthy and powerful Waterdhavians can afford large private libraries of bound tomes. Though the majority of citizens can read, and they do so often both for pleasure and to feel "on top of Mount Waterdeep" (which means commanding a view of current events, politics, trade activity, and near-future business opportunities), most citizens only own a few well-worn chapbooks, some traditional "long scrolls," and a large selection of the "short scrolls" commonly known as broadsheets (typically 1 cp on the street or in specialty shops).

Broadsheets are short, written newssheets that specialize in tabloid-style news, filled with political rants, sly social  
comments, jokes, and serialized "adventures" (often bawdy or pranksome) and are usually available for sale on the streets and in specialized shops. Chapbooks are apt to contain anything from poetry to furious arguments against guilds, governing policy, or methods of tiling roofs. However, chapbooks are most often devoted to memoirs and to romantic tales of either the tearful (for goodwives) or bawdy (for jacks old and young) variety. Long scrolls tend to have writing on one side only, and they are the form of choice for setting down religious texts, accounts that are maintained over time (large ledgers are favored for official coinkeeping, however), and spells that will be cast directly from the writing.

hung from the Castle battlements, while nobles are beheaded by the sword. Floggings are typically carried out at the Court of the White Bull. Death sentences are sometimes commuted to exile into Undermountain, although this often winds up with the same result.

### Festivals and Holy Dars

As Waterdeep is home to all manner of churches, cults, sects, nationalities, and racial groups, almost every calendar day is celebrated by one group or another, and not a tenday goes by without some local festival in one of the smaller neighborhoods of the city. The City of Splendors has long been tolerant of all such activities, so long as they do not violate the law or interfere with the flow of commerce. Waterdhavians became blasé about such public displays long ago, and most celebrations draw little more than a casual glance or a curse of annoyance when they momentarily get in the way. Nevertheless, in addition to the standard festivals of the Calendar of Harptos (see page 77 of the Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting), there are several other noteworthy festivals and holidays observed in the City of Splendors.

Ahghairon's Day: Celebrated on the first day of Eleasis, in honor of the Old Mage's birthday, this holiday does not affect the city's operation (aside from closing the Lord's Court). It is honored in small ways, with many toasts to the Lords of the city in tavern talk, bards performing songs in honor of the much-loved Old Mage, and the leaving of violets at the base of Ahghairon's Tower (C79), the Plinth (T48), or atop the altars of the House of Wonder ( $\$ 21$ ). The Open Lord often visits taverns and inns throughout the city to wish the people well, a practice continued by Piergeiron over the years, despite two assassination attempts during such visits.

Auril's Bleustide: Serving more to ward off the Frostmaiden than as a true celebration, this holy day is observed on the day of winter's first frost. Nearly everyone in the city wears white clothes, no one eats or serves hot meals, and vendors are largely absent from the streets. In the past century, a disrespectful lark by some unclothed and besotted young nobles has become a traditional part of the Auril's Day ceremonies; as such, a parade of white-cloaked (but otherwise naked) men and women runs from Cliffwatch in North Ward across the city, through the West Gate, and out onto the westernmost beaches. From there, the participants leap into the icy waters of the Sea of Swords, thus sacrificing their warmth to the Cold Goddess.

Fleetswake: Spanning the last tenday in Ches, this mariners' festival celebrates the sea, the sea trades, and the gods of the sea. Events are concentrated primarily in Dock Ward, although the Fiery Flagon ( $\$ 37$ ) in Sea Ward sees a great deal of activity as well. Notable events include boat races (involving both private boats and the navy's rakers), the annual Shipwrights' Ball at the Shipwrights' House (D19), and guild-sponsored galas at the Copper Cup festhall (D54). Any ship entering the harbor during Fleetswake is charged 1 gp per day (rather than the standard docking fee), which is added to the Fair Seas tribute to Umberlee.

Lliira's Night: Celebrated on the 7th of Flamerule, this nightlong festival honors the Lady of Joy with dances and balls held throughout the city. The Cynosure Ball is the highlight of the night, sponsored jointly by the Lords, the local clergy of Lliira, and various noble families. Many festhalls become centers of wild carefree dancing and other pursuits under the Lady's purview.

### Visiting Waterdeep

Adventurers from all over Faerûn come to Waterdeep in search of wealth, knowledge, trade, and adventure. The City of Splendors lies on the western coast of Faerûn, just north of the mouth of the River Dessarin. It can be reached by air, by sea, overland, through the caverns of the Northdark, by spell, or by portal.

### Roads and Trade Routes

Four major overland trade routes connect the City of Splendors to the rest of Faerûn-the High Road, the Long Road, the Trade Way, and the East Trail. A fifth road, the Coast Way, leads north along the coast from the Troll Gate until it joins with the High Road several miles north of the city.

The High Road enters Waterdeep through the Northgate at the northern end of Sea Ward and continues through the city until it becomes the Trade Way upon exiting the South Gate. The High Road leads north along the coast, threading between the Mere of Dead Men and the Sword Mountains, connecting the City of Splendors to Leilon, Neverwinter, Port Llast, and Luskan. Overland traffic along the High Road is dominated by metal ores from the Frozenfar, metalwork from the City of Sails, lumber from the Neverwinter Woods, the craftwork of the City of Skilled Hands, and the agricultural and artistic bounty of the City of Splendors.

The Long Road splits away from the High Road a dozen miles north of the city proper. It runs north-northeast through the Dessarin River valley, passing through such settlements as Rassalantar, Amphail, Red Larch, Westbridge, Triboar, Longsaddle, and Xantharl's Keep, until it reaches its terminus in Mirabar. Metal ores and metalwork from Mirabar, cattle and livestock (including shaggun, a herd animal that resembles the bison) from Longsaddle, leatherwork from Triboar, and Waterdeep's myriad trade goods dominate overland traffic along the Long Road.

The Trade Way leads south along the coast, passing through Daggerford before skirting inland of the Trollbark Forest and Troll Hills. South of Dragonspear Castle it forks, with one branch leading southeast toward Scornubel and the Sea of Fallen Stars, and the other bending westward to reach the city of Baldur's Gate and the northern terminus of the Coast Way. Trade is dominated by raw materials heading south (metal ore, lumber), spices heading north, and agricultural produce and finished goods sent in both directions.

The East Trail leads east from the Trade Way several miles south of Ardeep Forest and runs up the lower Delimbiyr valley, connecting Secomber, Loudwater, and Llorkh to the Zhentarim-

---

built Black Road across the sands of Anauroch. Craftwork and rare spices pass in both directions along this route, although traffic is but a fraction of that running north and south along the Sword Coast.

### Sea Lanes

Countless ships ply the waters of the Sea of Swords, although most of them remain within twenty miles of Faerún's western coast. The bulk of the Waterdhaçian traffic flows along the legs of the triangle formed by Waterdeep, Carr Calidyrr in the Moonshaes, and Baldur's Gate and north along the Twilit Coast to Neverwinter and Luskan. Some ships venture farther south along the coast to Athkatla and Murann. Only heavily armed merchant cogs dare Asavir's Channel, for the pirates of the Nclanther regularly prey on ships headed south to the coastal cities of Tethyr and the Shining Sea. In recent years, more and more shipborne traffic has headed west to Ruathym and from there to the colony of New Waterdeep in distant Maztica. Orlumbor, Mintarn, and the lesser isles of the northern Trackless Sea are infrequent ports of call, but collectively make up a not insignificant amount of sea traffic.

### Spells and Portals

As Waterdeep's reputation as the City of Splendors has spread across Faerún and beyond, it has increasingly become the favorite port of call for powerful adventurers, no matter where the whims of Lady Luck take them. Given the availability of various teleport spells to such folk, visits to the City of Splendors can become a fairly standard occurrence. In order to discourage such folk from appearing in the middle of a city street and to increase the safety of such travels, the Watchful Order of Magists \& Protectors maintains a deliberate teleport target just northeast of the South Gate, between the inner and outer walls. Members of the guild ensure that the site remains both static and very distinctive, which is important to safe teleportation of all types. A circle of white marble pillars, each engraved with a stylized depiction of a local animal (bear, wolf, or the like), make it simple to become very familiar with the site.

In addition to spells, Waterdeep is also well connected to the rest of Faerún by portals. Unfortunately, thanks to centuries of  
portal building by the Mad Mage of Undermountain, most of those portals actually enter the halls of Undermountain and not the city proper. Known portals leading to and from Waterdeep include the ones described below.  
The Angry Coxswain Portal: This one-way keyed portal links the Angry Coxswain alehouse (D67) with a prison cell in a slave market in the Mulhorandi city of Skuld. This portal is employed by two slavers-the innkeeper Ramas Shehepset (NE male Mulan human expert 5) and the house brewmaster Orth Ironchisel (LE male duergar expert 2/fighter 6). They dispatch captives through it and employ Drejal of the Unseen to make it seem like the victims are still around.

The Glow-Gate: This one-way malfunctioning portal (in the form of a lit inscription) connects the depths of Undermountain with a glade in the depths of the King's Forest in Cormyr. The glade is a half-day's trek north, off the road that links Dhedluk and Immersea and just west of the River Starwater. Gravegate of Geniste: This one-way portal links the depths of Undermountain with the abandoned village of Geniste in the southeastern Purple Hills.  
The Illusk Arch: This two-way portal links the depths of Undermountain with an abandoned warehouse in Luskan near the Ruins of Illusk.

The Lightsinger Theater Portal: This two-way variable portal connects a prop room in the Lightsinger Theater (C56) with portals in Ankhapur (in the sewers near the docks), Luskan (a storeroom in a wheelwright's shop called Wiley's Wheels), and Mulmaster (a dark corner of the Scarlet Hippogriff Trading Concern's main warehouse).

Lost Lover's Gate: This one-way portal links a tidal pool in a sea cave one mile north of Llorbauth's northern gate along the coast of the Deepwash to the depths of Undermountain.

Lost Princess Road: This keyed two-way portal network connects the Purple Hills, south of the holy house of St. Rhynda's, with an abandoned quarry in northeastern Amn, by the Troll Mountains, and with Skarn Rock, off the coast near the mouth of the River Chionthar. From Skarn Rock, one can travel to the gorge beneath the Bridge of Fallen Men, west of Cormyr, to the slopes of Mount Waterdeep, up and east from Silavene's festhall (C3), and to the confluence of the Unicorn Run and the River Delimbiyr. However, no one seems to know what the

---

key is, so would-be travelers will have to discover the key before using the portal.

The Sargauth Flow: This one-way portal links the River Sargauth with the depths of the ruined fortress of Inthar, which stands atop a sea crag east of Ruathym and south of Axard.

The Slitherswamp Drain: This one-way variable portal connects the depths of the Slitherswamp sublevel of Undermountain with the grasslands west of Ithkyxan's Lair (see Serpent Kingdoms page 108) in the shadows of the western Serpent Hills and with the depths of the Nameless Dungeon in the northeastern High Forest.

The Sundered Throne: This variable two-way portal in the form of a throne in the depths of Undermountain leads to the Rat Hills, the exit of the Slitherswamp Drain, one of the guano-covered sea stacks outside Waterdeep's harbor, and a vampire's tomb in the mountains north of Waterdeep.

The Welcome Gates: This keyed two-way portal connects the Lantanna embassy in Waterdeep with Visitors' Vale outside the city of Anchoril on the isle of Suj. In addition to the key (the word "Enjoy"), guards protect access to the Lantanna portal, using a maze of bureaucracy designed to keep out undesirables.

### Trade in Waterdeep

In a city as large as Waterdeep, almost anything is available for sale, and almost anything can be sold. Travelers come from all over Faerûn to shop in Waterdeep's markets and bargain with Waterdeep's merchants. Trade in Waterdeep runs the gamut, from finished goods and edible treats to special services and even illegal items. Most commerce in illicit goods such as assassinations, drugs, poisons, slaves, or evil magic items occurs in Skullport, though a good deal of trade in minor illicit goods (proprietary information and stolen property) occurs in Waterdeep's own shadows.

Table 1-1, on pages 18-19, lists objects and services available for sale in Waterdeep (including Skullport) and places where such things might be acquired or sold. Base prices for almost all of the goods on Table 1-1 are as found in Chapter 7 of the Player's Handbook. (The exceptions are broadsheet and chapbooks, for which base prices are given in the lefthand column of the table, and certain services for which prices are highly variable.) The column headers on Table 1-1 are defined below.

Category: Defines the general type of goods or services.  
Location (Key): Indicates the name of the locale and the map key (as shown on the city maps, pages 95-109). The abbreviations refer to city wards, as discussed in the introduction.

Markup: This is the price multiplier that a vendor places on an object or service when selling it (usually 1.0 , but ranges from 0.9 to 1.5 ). Apply this multiplier to the item's base price to determine how much it really costs in Waterdeep. An entry of "var," often seen for establishments that offer services, means that the price is variable depending on the quality of service desired and the result of negotiations.

Resale Value: This is the price multiplier used by a storekeeper or individual who offers to purchase an object or service. This value is most often between 0.4 and 0.6 (except for trade  
goods, which always have a multiplier of 1.0 ; see Table $7-3$ in the Player's Handbook). Apply this multiplier to the base price to determine how much an individual can get for something he sells in Waterdeep. An entry of "na" (not applicable) means that the establishment in question does not purchase goods or services of this sort.

### Research in Waterdeep

Just as Waterdeep is known as a place where nearly anything can be purchased or sold, it is also a place where spies, rumormongers, libraries, magical researchers, and sages flourish. Table 1-2, on page 21 , provides a list of types of information (usually the name of a skill) and places in Waterdeep where such information might be acquired. Usually, access to such sources provides a circumstance bonus on appropriate skill checks or access to someone with many ranks in a particular skill.

### Coins and Trade Bars

Although only coins and trade bars minted by the Lords of Waterdeep are technically considered legal tender in the City of Splendors, all forms of currency are welcome in this merchantfriendly city. However, suspect coins and trade bars, including those of uncertain antique vintage oft-recovered by adventurers, might be refused or deeply discounted by wary merchants.

Coins of Waterdhavian mintage include harbor moons, taols, suns (platinum pieces), dragons (gold pieces), shards (silver pieces), and nibs (copper pieces). Harbor moons are worth 50 gp in the city and 30 gp outside the city walls. Named for their traditional use by the docks for buying large amounts of cargo at a time, harbor moons are fashioned of platinum inset with electrum and consist of a crescent with a hole cut into the center of its curve. Taols, worth 2 gp within the city walls and almost nothing beyond them, are square, flat brass coins issued and honored by the Lords' treasury. Among some neighborhoods and classes, slang terms for various coins rise and fall in popularity. Most Waterdharians apply local names to foreign coins as well. Thus an Amnian danter or Cormyrean golden lion is still called a dragon in the City of Splendors.

Trade bars are usually blocks of silver (which quickly corrode to black) in $1-, 10-, 25-$, and 50 -pound weights (worth 5, 50, 125 , and 250 gp , respectively). They are common throughout the North and used everywhere in Faerûn. (In the South, gems are more often used for such purposes.)

### City Defenses

Waterdeep is ably defended against external attack, with many of the defenses dating back to the First and Second Trollwars and the Orcfastings War. The recent invasions from the sea during the Deepwater War and the extraplanar invasion during the Time of Troubles revealed new weaknesses in Waterdeep's defenses, which the Lords are moving quickly to correct.

The city's first line of defense is its topography; Waterdeep's coastlines and placement atop the high, sloping plateau sur-

rounding Mount Waterdeep deter most orc and troll hordes from even making the attempt. The bald, rough crag enables the city's defenders to occupy the high ground. Just below the summit on the landward side is the Peaktop Aerie (C67), home to the city's griffon cavalry, and two Watching Towers (C68 and C69), one located high above Piergeiron's Palace and the other overlooking the Naval Harbor, give the city's lookouts unobstructed views in all directions. The city's natural harbor is  
a nigh-perfect redoubt on the Trackless Sea. The navy occupies the Naval Harbor at the west end of the Great Harbor and garrisons four forts along Deepwater Isle, Stormhaven Isle, and the Harborwatch Peninsula.

Waterdeep is shielded by the Trollwall, thus named for its role in the Trollwars. These stout stone walls (AC 3; hardness $8 ; 1,170 \mathrm{hp}$ per 10 -foot section) are 15 feet thick and 40 feet high, and have crenellations on both sides and a tunnel and

small rooms running through the interior. The walls encircle the entire city, except for a small stretch north of the City of the Dead, known as the Cliffwatch, where the cliffs are so high that they act as effective walls. A second set of walls wraps around the northern edge of the city and the South Gate, providing an additional line of defense against land invasions. Even the islands that form the harbor are walled, connected to the mainland and each other by stout chains that bar passage to ships in times of war. Five major gates pierce the Trollwall-South Gate, River Gate, Northgate, Troll Gate, and Westgate.

Waterdeep is also enmeshed in a variety of magic wards, the effects of which are largely unknown, even (in some cases) to Khelben. Only Ahghairon and Halaster had or have a near-complete understanding of Waterdeep's magical defenses, which typically encompass the outer (fortified) walls and cliff tops, all of Mount Waterdeep and Deepwater Isle down to the low tide lines on their seaward sides, and so reach a maximum two-dimensional extent of 10,500 feet east to west, and 23,000 feet north to south.

Waterdeep's armed forces include the City Watch, which plays the role of a police force; the City Guard, which defends the city from external land-based threats; the City Navy, which defends the city from external sea-based threats; and the Griffon Cavalry, which defends the skies above Waterdeep. The merfolk and sea elves of Deepwater Harbor form an aquatic contingent of the City Guard, and the Gray Hands act as an elite strike force for the Lords. Waterdeep's last line of defense is the most important-its ever-resilient citizenry. On more than one occasion, the inhabitants of Waterdeep have rallied to defend

![img-8.jpeg](assets/City%20of%20Splendors,%20Waterdeep_img-8.jpeg)  
their city, reinforcing the City Guard and City Watch. Likewise, the city's arcane and divine spellcasters have crafted numerous wards and other magical defenses against external attack. Two examples are given below-Abghairon's dragonward and the Walking Statues.

## Ahghairon's Dragonward

Just over three centuries ago, the noted adventurer Ranressa Shiard flew over the palace and alighted from dragonback atop Mount Waterdeep to a hero's welcome. However, her dramatic flourish caused much consternation among the Waterdhavian populace, leading Ahghairon to craft a magic ward that prevents most wyrms from doing such a thing today.

The City of Splendors is now blanketed by an epic spell known as Abghairon's dragonward. Any creature of the dragon type attempting to enter the city is subject to an antipathy effect (Will DC 41). The effect is a mythal centered beneath Ahghairon's Tower. Notable exceptions to its coverage include the halls of the Mad Mage below the city and the docks along the harbor. (The southern reaches of Dock Ward are outside the effect because the city slopes down just beneath the ward's coverage. This little-known fact is occasionally exploited by wyrms that swim into the harbor and meet with minions along the docks or in the southernmost sewers.)

Although some dragons have obviously bypassed the dragonward, even the Lords of Waterdeep are not sure how this is done. The truth is that any dragon that touches the dragonstaff of Abghairon, currently in the possession of Maaril (see page 32), can ignore the dragonward until such time as that dragon is again struck again by the dragonstaff or until the expiration of a period of time specified by Maaril. As a result, the Dragon Mage of Waterdeep is able to closely regulate the number of dragons residing in the city proper, giving him a great deal of quiet influence over their number and kind.

At the present time, only a handful of song dragons ${ }^{\mathrm{MF}}$ and half-dragons permanently reside in the City of Splendors, for the Dragon Mage has little interest in allowing the entry of those who could wreak havoc within "his" demesne. That said, Maaril sometimes finds it in his interest to do so. For example, it was Maaril who enabled Grimnoshtadrano, the Riddling Dragon of the High Forest, to attack Iriador "Garnet" Wintermist during Shieldmeet in the Year of the Wave ( 1364 DR), thus indirectly upholding the rule of the Lords. The Dragon Mage's price was the service of Grimnoshtadrano's offspring as a steed and guardian. Likewise it was Maaril who allowed the topaz dragon Gaulauntyr (see the Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting) entry into the city. Maaril's price was a small fraction of her hoard and the promise of regular tithes of stolen magic items.

### The Melairshield

Over two millennia ago, the Fair Folk of Aelinthaldaar foresaw that dwarven Melairbode might one day grow to honeycomb the entire plateau beneath their city. While the capital city of Illefern is no more, one enduring legacy that survives until this day is the Melairshield, a powerful high magic mythal that

still guards the City of Splendors against excessive tunneling in Halaster's Halls. Specifically, the Melairshield renders the top 100 feet of the Waterdhavian plateau immune to collapse, no matter how much dirt and stone is excavated from the depths of the plateau. It in no way prevents new excavations, magical or otherwise, but it does prevent the cumulative effect of such excavations ever leading to the collapse of the plateau.

Although Khelben has discerned that the Melairshield exists, only Halaster truly understands the protection it affords the city above and the unspoken thanks owed by the citizens of Waterdeep to the long-dead High Mages of Aelinthaldaar.

### Walking Statues of Waterdeep

Built by the Archmage of Waterdeep and controlled by him and the Open Lord, the eight giant stone colossi known as the Walking Statues of Waterdeep (described in more detail on page 139) play a unique role in the city's defense. During times of peace, one statue stands on Gull Leap, gazing out over the waters of the Trackless Sea, while the others are hidden away on the Ethereal Plane-two at the base of the Cliffwatch, two within Mount Waterdeep (to defend the Castle and the Palace), one each beneath Northgate, River Gate, and South Gate.

The Material Plane statue is dormant and unmoving, normally remaining motionless unless under the direct command of Khelben or the Open Lord. Over time, it tends to accumulate birds' nests, moss, mantles of snow, and other such cosmetic debris. Many visitors to the city naturally believe it is nothing more than a gigantic statue. However, certain conditions can cause the statue to animate and act to defend the city even without an explicit command, based on a set of "standing orders" dictated long ago. For example, the statue attacks any Huge or larger creature that it perceives is engaged in destructive or hostile activity against the city, and the statue also acts to defend itself against serious attack.

The colossi on the Ethereal Plane do not shift to the Material Plane unless summoned by the Open Lord or the Archmage of the city. However, they actively guard against ethereal intrusion into the city. They ignore ethereal humanoids (unless such creatures are traveling in a company of ten or more) but attack other ethereal creatures they perceive within the bounds of the city. Visibility on the Material Plane for an ethereal creature is limited to 60 feet (see the ethereal jaunt spell, page 227 of the Player's Handbook), so unless an intruder happens to pass close by one of the city gates or approaches the Castle or the Palace, the ethereal statues are not likely to notice the intrusion.

## PEOLE

### WATERDEED

The City of Splendors is home to a wide and varied range of individuals and groups, ranging from the bards of New Olamn to the Savants of the Dark Tide, and from the pampered scions of the merchant nobility to the hardworking members of the Cellarers' \& Plumbers' Guild. This chapter details a sampling of notable and typical characters usually found in Waterdeep, as well as the organizations to which they belong.

### Guilds and Organizations

Dungeon Master's Guide II introduces rules for contacts, guilds, and organizations. Waterdeep is home to hundreds of distinct orders, societies, noble houses, churches, gangs, guard companies, and so on. The most important of these organizations are described with an organization statistics block that sums up the organization's type, resources, leaders, and membership benefits.

For purposes of this presentation, the term "guild" means any organization or group, ranging from the clergy of a particular faith to the city guards to mercantile guilds or associations of craftsfolk. (The word has a much broader definition in this book than it does in Dungeon Master's Guide II, and the format for organization descriptions presented below varies in some ways from the format for guild descriptions in that book.)

### Organization Format

The various guilds, orders, houses, and organizations of the city are presented in the following format.

Name (Size [Minor, Standard, or Expansive] Type [Arcane, Criminal, etc.]): AL [alignment abbreviation]; \# gp resource limit; Membership \#; [Racial mix: Isolated, Mixed, or Integrated] [(race \#, race \#, race \#, etc.)]; Dues \# gp/month (\# gp to join).

Favored in Guild Fringe Benefit; If you have the Favored in Guild feat, you gain this special benefit for belonging to this guild.

Requirements: Any special requirements of the character's time or efforts required by that guild or organization. If a character does not meet the requirements, he does not gain any benefits for belonging to that guild until he begins to meet the requirements again.

### Joining a Guild

In order to join a guild, you must have at least one level in any one of the guild's associated classes, and you must have at least 4 ranks in any one of the guild's associated skills. Finally, you must obtain the DM's approval. While big organizations such as the Church of Tyr turn away few suitable candidates, exclusive guilds such as Blackstaff Tower don't just take anyone who walks in off the street.

When you join a guild, you are assumed to be a lay memberyou gain a few general benefits, such as a safe place to sleep and eat, but you gain no special powers or advantages. If you want to associate yourself more closely with your chosen guild, you need to select the Favored in Guild or Guildmaster feats, both  
described in Dungeon Master's Guide II. For your convenience, we've reprinted the Favored in Guild feat here.

### New Feat: Favored in Guild

You are an active and valued member of your guild.  
Prerequisites: Membership in a guild.  
Benefit: Select one of your guild's associated skills. As long as you remain a member of the guild, you gain a $+2$ competence bonus on all checks made with that skill.

A guild member with this feat also gains one additional fringe benefit, the exact details of which depend on his guild. The benefits are described under each guild entry.

Normal: To receive general benefits from your guild, you must pay your monthly dues. You do not gain any guild fringe benefits.

### Arcane Schools and Practitioners

Arcane spellcasters have long been drawn to cosmopolitan Waterdeep. The City of Splendors has a strong tradition of magical research, and its role as a central trading hub means that one can purchase nearly any material component therein. However, Waterdeep's strong guild system, specifically the Watchful Order of Magists \& Protectors, has prevented the formation of many arcanists' academies such as those found in cities such as Silverymoon today or Myth Drannor before the fall. As a result, most Waterdhavian wizards and sorcerers are either very powerful lone practitioners or members of the Watchful Order. Likewise, most bards are either legendary troubadours or members of the Council of Musicians, Instru-ment-makers, \& Choristers.

### Blackstaff Tower

In the years since Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun rescued Laeral Silverhand from the madness induced by the Crown of Horns, the two have dwelt together in Blackstaff Tower (C6) along with an everchanging roster of apprentices. Over time, as those apprentices have taken on students of their own, the students of the Lord and Lady Mage of Waterdeep have effectively formed an informal, elite arcanists' academy. Although Khelben and Laeral remain titular master and mistress of the school, most day-to-day administration and instruction of junior arcanists is left to the more senior apprentices.

About fifty apprentices reside at Blackstaff Tower at any one time. The more senior apprentices, well trained in defensive magics, defend the Tower against monstrous incursions and hostile wizards.

Khelben and Laeral make very sure that no one is treated badly or allowed to chafe in restlessness, so the temptation of treachery is slight. Arcanists desiring to leave are always assisted in setting up in new locations so they part with the folk of the Tower as friends. The result is a steady stream of arrivals and departures. Graduates of Blackstaff Academy include Achem el Zalath (NG male Calishite human wizard 11 of the Guild

Pavored in Guild Pringe Benefit: As a student of Blackstaff Academy, you are eligible to select the Blessed of the Seven Sisters ${ }^{\text {PG }}$ feat, assuming you meet the prerequisites. You can learn rare or unique spells created by Khelben or Laeral (for example, blackstaff ${ }^{\text {Mag }}$, Kbelben's dweomerdoom', Kbelben's suspended silence ${ }^{\text {Mag }}$, Laeral's cutting band ${ }^{\text {Mag }}$, and Laeral's silver lance ${ }^{9}$, with the notable exception of Laeral's crowning touch ${ }^{9}$ ) any time you have the opportunity to learn new spells, but you may not learn more than one such spell per level gained. Wizards gain three new spells each time they gain a level instead of two.

Special: Admittance to Blackstaff Academy usually requires demonstration of exceptional magical talent (Spellcasting Prodigy or a similar feat) or a uniquely compelling personal history. Nonwizards are very rarely admitted.

### Laeral SilverHand Arunsun

Anamanué Laeral Silverhand was born in the Year of the Cowl ( 765 DR), the fifth of seven daughters. Raised in Silverhand Tower (in a wooded dell near what is now Longsaddle) by Elminster alongside Dove and Storm, Laeral was the first of the three sisters to set out on her own.

As the Witch-Queen of the North, Laeral founded Stornanter in the Year of the Warrior's Rest (806 DR). The Realm of the Witch-Queen, roughly triangular in shape, stretched from the River Mirar to the outlying farms of Neverwinter and from Swordsea Coast to the Crags. Stornanter's capital was the coastal town of Port Llast, and Laeral's tower stood on the high, rocky spit that sheltered the port's small bay. Stornanter lasted barely thirty-five years, twenty-five of which Laeral spent wandering the hinterlands aiding the common folk. In the Year of the Hunted Elk (841 DR), Laeral was manipulated into battling Syluné, and the sisters Silverhand would have destroyed each other if not for the intervention of Mystra, who invited both to become her Chosen.

In the centuries that followed, Laeral wandered the Sword Coast in the service of Mystra, and she became known for her fearlessness and for creating magic items. She adopted many guises during this period, most of which even Khelben does not know.

Eventually, Laeral came to lead a band of adventurers known as the Nine, and she took them on a long and wild string of adventures across the North. The band split into three warring factions in the Year of the Wandering Maiden (1337 DR) after Laeral succumbed to the Crown of Horns in the Stronghold of the Nine on the banks of the Unicorn Run. While she was mad, Laeral bore a daughter named Maura Silverhand (apparently with the consent of Mystra), who now dwells on the isle of Evermeet; Maura's father is unknown. Khelben and Alustriel rescued Laeral in the Year of the Prince (1357 DR) and slowly nursed her back to sanity over the next three years in Blackstaff Tower.

Over the past dozen years, Laeral has risen to prominence as the Lady Mage of Waterdeep, consort of the Blackstaff. Although she never formally married Khelben, she has taken his name and is now known as Laeral Arunsun. She runs Blackstaff Tower and has been active in both the Harpers and as an agent of the Lords of Waterdeep. Given Khelben's off-again, on-again relationship with both the Harpers and the Lords of Waterdeep, Laeral's relationship with both groups is currently undetermined. She seems to have retained her influence with both, all the while working alongside the Blackstaff and the Tel Teukiira.

Most recently, Laeral led a Waterdhavian army to relieve Evereska from the phaerimms and snuck into Shade along with several other Chosen of Mystra in an attempt to bring down the floating city. Although Shade was not destroyed, the city's mytballar was damaged and the Karsestone lost. Laeral then helped Evereska defeat the phaerimms before returning to Waterdeep.

Laeral is a slim, lithe woman of surpassing beauty and impish twinkling eyes. Charming by nature, she is a consummate actress and a natural judge of character. She is widely admired by nobles, guildsfolk, and common citizens alike, although some fear her for her former madness or for her association with the Blackstaff. Laeral is comfortable in both forester's skins and leathers as well as splendid finery, and is generally lighthearted, merry, hard-drinking, and fearless. She dislikes troublemakers and those who spin deliberate untruths for harmful reasons.

---

Lady Arunsun sees magic as the tool of the little folk to defend themselves against those who are stronger. She loves to find, play with, and fine-tune item enchantments, attend parties in formal garb, and dabble in intrigue. She is the chatelaine of Blackstaff Tower, a coordinator (now informal) of Harper activities in the City of Splendors, and a frequent visitor to the Port of Shadow in the guise of Irusyl Eraneth.

### Eltorchul Academy

Upon inheriting the family spice and import business, Lord Thesp Eltorchul invested the family fortune into arcane academia and rare magical component procurement. The family has run Eltorchul Academy for three decades now, having slowly elevated it into an elite bastion of noble scions and the children of the well-to-do.

In the Year of the Banner ( 1368 DR), Lord Thesp's son and heir, Oth Eltorchul, was left a babbling husk after dabbling in the creation of dream spheres with the Mbaorkiira Hadryad. Fallout from the dream spheres affair nearly bankrupted the family, forcing them to open the doors of Eltorchul Academy to all manner of students willing and able to pay. As a result, current students and recent graduates of Eltorchul Academy vary widely in talent, ability, social status, and outlook, and the academy's status among the social elite has plummeted.

### Enclave of Red Magic

The Red Wizards of Thay have long sought to rule Faerûn. For centuries, they sought to do so through force of arms, but in recent years, they have turned to trade as part of a plan of economic conquest. Thay's Guild of Foreign Trade now administers sovereign trading enclaves in cities across Faerûn.

Waterdeep's wealth and role as Gateway to the North makes it an obvious choice in which to establish a Thayan enclave. However, the Lords of Waterdeep flatly rejected the Three Laws of the Enclave when approached by representatives of Thay, refusing to compromise Waterdeep's sovereignty or countenance the sale of slaves within the city. After several years of futile negotiations, the Thayans finally found a way around the restrictions. By reviewing public records detailing the chaos of Halaster's Higharvestide, the Thayans deduced the presence of a forgotten two-way portal between Skullport's Lower Heart District and Waterdeep's Castle Ward.

Late in the Year of the Tankard ( 1370 DR), agents of Thay approached the recently returned Shradin Mulophor about establishing an enclave in Skullport. The Lord of Bones quickly agreed, and the Thayan enclave was established shortly thereafter between Beggar's Rest Pass and Steamfall Pass. At the same time, representatives of Thay established an embassy (C70) in Castle Ward overlooking the Market between the Sutherlane, Mendever Street, and Trader's Way. As an embassy, the building is considered sovereign territory of Thay, exempt from the laws of Waterdeep. Because the Red Wizards are careful never to conduct business within the embassy proper, it is in no danger of losing its sovereign status. "Visitors" (customers) are simply conducted to a "back room" (through a portal to an inner room in the Skullport enclave) where such transactions are concluded. It is the customer's choice whether to bring purchased goods out of the embassy or to have them delivered somewhere outside the city walls.

While the Lords of Waterdeep are well aware of how closely the Thayans are skirting to the edge of the law, for now they have chosen to simply observe the enclave's transactions. Most customers are wholly unaware that they have even left Waterdeep, leading most to assume that the transaction took place within the city and thus speculate that the Thayans have bought or bribed themselves an exemption from the law.

The real threats to the enclave's continued success are threefold. First, noble families with dark dealings in Skullport view the enclave as a threat to their continued domination of trade with the Port of Shadow. Second, the leaders of the Watchful Order see the enclave's growth as a direct threat to their primary revenue streams (the sale of magic items and

---

rare components), despite the fact that many of the resident Red Wizards have joined the Watchful Order. Finally, Shradin Mulophor's recognition of the enclave might not be worth much, given that the Skulls are the real power in Skullport. The leaders of the enclave have successfully concealed this situation from the Guild of Foreign Trade back in Thay, recognizing that the enclave might be closed down if the Thayan bureaucrats realized that the Three Laws of the Enclave are not really in effect.

Base of Operations: Thayan Embassy (C70), Thayan enclave in the Lower Heart district of Skullport.

Enclave of Red Magic (Standard Arcane): AL LE, NE, LN; 40,000 gp resource limit; Membership 130; Isolated (humans 125, gnolls 3, tieflings 2); Wages 5 gp per level per month (no cost to join), or twice that rate for arcane spellcasters.

Authority Figure: Ambassador Ethur Anszim (see below).  
Important Characters: Consul Thazar "Skullstorm" Arkanak (see below); Consul Orgin Ulmokina (see below); Zabbas Thuul (see page 71 ).

Associated Classes: Fighter, rogue, wizard.  
Associated Skills: Appraise, Craft (alchemy), Intimidate, Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge (the planes), Spellcraft.

Requirements: You are required to serve in the embassy or its Skullport annex for an average of 30 hours per tenday. Each month, you must also donate at least 100 gp of magic items to the enclave for resale. (Donations are measured by market value, not their cost to create.)

Favored in Guild Fringe Benefit: The guild subsidizes your monetary expenses when creating magic items, reducing raw materials cost by $10 \%$.

Special: Membership in Thay's Waterdeep enclave is restricted to natives of Thay dispatched by the Guild of Foreign Trade. The enclave's ranks also include nonhuman servitors and slaves, although both groups are restricted to,Skullport's warrens. Zabbas Thuul and a handful of others are not actually members of the enclave, but serve as Skullport/Waterdeep go-betweens.

Some of the enclave's more important characters include:  
Ambassador Ethur Anszim: Ethur (LE male Mulan human wizard 11/Red Wizard 5) is the urbane, witty Thayan ambassador to Waterdeep. He is regularly invited to noble parties across the city, for he provides an exotic eastern flavor with a whiff of danger, perfect for the "daring" host or hostess. In private, Ethur is harsh and unforgiving, covetous of Waterdeep's great wealth and determined to bring the City of Splendors to its knees under his dominion.

Consul Thazar "Skullstorm" Arkanak: Thazar (NE male Mulan human fighter 7/blackguard 2/Thayan knight ${ }^{(2)} 2$ ) is the ambassador's personal bodyguard, a dark and glowering figure who inspires dread wherever he goes.

Consul Orgin Ulmokina: Orgin (CE male Rashemi human rogue 7/Thayan slaver ${ }^{\text {( }}$ in 3 ) is the cruel overseer of the Skullport enclave. He has never been to Waterdeep, and has no interest in visiting a city that does not allow him complete mastery over his slaves.

### Holaster's Heirs

Centuries ago, Halaster Blackcloak and his seven apprentices established Halaster's Hold and began exploring the dwarven delvings beneath the plateau. Of the Seven, one is known to be dead and two are known to still live-Trobriand the Metal Mage and Muiral the Misshapen. In addition, in the years since Halaster claimed the Underhalls for his own, the Mad Mage has taken on additional apprentices, some of whom still stalk the depths of Undermountain.

In the Year of the Gauntlet ( 1369 DR), the events of Halaster's Higharvestide upset the delicate status quo in the Underhalls of the Mad Mage. Among the tumultuous events of that day, Trobriand was attacked by his abandoned experiments and driven from his lair in a deep sublevel of Undermountain, and Muiral was expelled into the streets of Waterdeep by means of a malfunctioning portal. Trobriand convinced Muiral to return to the first level of Undermountain, where the mad-ness-inducing magic of Undermountain was at its weakest. There the two ex-apprentices forged an alliance, agreeing to work together to carve out a new domain largely beyond the reach of the Undermountain's maddening taint, but sufficiently within Halaster's Halls to allow them to continue to pursue their interests.

As word spread of a hidden arcanists' academy located in the first level of Undermountain near the shaft to the Yawning Portal (C48), dozens of dark arcanists flocked to their service, drawn from across the North and the length of the Sword Coast.

Base of Operations: Level 1 of Undermountain, in the vicinity of the Yawning Portal.

Halaster's Heirs (Minor Arcane): AL CE, NE, LE; 15,000 gp resource limit; Membership 40; Isolated (humans 36, shield dwarf 2, other 2); Does 25 gp per month ( 250 gp to join).

level gained. The guild subsidizes your monetary expenses when creating constructs, reducing the raw materials cost by $10 \%$.

Muiral and Trobriand are the undisputed masters of the academy.  
Muiral the Misshapen: Muiral (CE male tauric ${ }^{\text {bar }}$ human/ Large monstrous scorpion barbarian 3/wizard 14/archmage 2) was once a bodyguard for Halaster Blackcloak. He abandoned his warrior ways, to study the Art under the tutelage of the great wizard. Muiral was the first of the Seven to follow the Mad Mage into Undermountain, passing the "tests" of Halaster's guardian monsters. Muiral established his lair amid the ruins of Kyorlamshin and began studying "superior" physical forms. After he had spent decades experimenting on drow, spiders, and vermin, Muiral's research led to his catastrophic transformation into a half-human, half-scorpion abomination.

In the centuries since his transformation, Muiral the Misshapen has wandered the deep ways of Undermountain, stalking and killing all who cross his path. His rage at his own stupidity for taking this powerful but hideous form-coupled with the degenerative effects of Undermountain that also afflict Halaster-has led him into extended bouts of madness.

Only recently has Muiral regained a degree of lucidity. He now seeks to continue his research, in hopes of achieving a new and better form. Once again, he has taken apprentices under his tutelage, but he views them more as experimental fodder than as wards for whom he is responsible.

### Trobriand the Metal Mage

Trobriand is the most powerful surviving ex-apprentice of Halaster, having long ago made his peace with his former master. Known as "the  
Metal Mage" for his penchant for creating metal constructs,

Trobriand avoids direct combat, preferring to allow his creations to fight for him. The Metal Mage appears as a thin, clean-shaven man with long, steel-gray hair. He is unnaturally tall, but he stoops in his old age, bringing his eyes to about six feet from the floor.

Trobriand kept to his heavily guarded laboratories in the depths of Undermountain (UM L7) for centuries until he was driven forth by the events of Halaster's Higharvestide. Of the Seven, he kept the firmest grip on his sanity, but even he succumbed in part to Undermountain-instilled madness. Having finally recognized the danger posed by remaining therein, the Metal Mage now seeks to establish a new stronghold in the Lands of Light, preferably on the site of Halaster's Hold, now occupied by the Yawning Portal tavern.

Trobriand is the true leader of Halaster's Heirs, and he is responsible for training most of the school's newly recruited apprentices. Only his deft touch keeps Muiral from rampaging through the streets of Waterdeep. Trobriand continues to design and build constructs of metal, including helmed horrors ${ }^{\mathrm{MF}}$, iron golems, and scaladars".

### New Olamn

In the Year of the Wave ( 1364 DR), a former Harper named Iriador "Garnet" Wintermist unleashed a series of unconventional attacks against the inhabitants of the Sword Coast. Her anger stemmed from the decline of bardcraft and the evolution of the Harpers away from their founding ideals. Although she was ultimately defeated, several Waterdhavians took her lesson to heart and refounded Waterdeep's old bardic college two years later in what had been the Cliffride villas of Heroes' Rest and Stormwatch. (The old location was the House of Song [T19].)

Backed primarily by the Crommer, Estelmer, Majarra, Melshimber, and Thann noble families as well as the Council of Musicians, Instrument-Makers, \& Choristers, New Olamn has become a noted education center and an excellent storehouse of knowledge in just a few short years, with bards coming from across the Realms to study within its walls.

Those generally acknowledged to have successfully completed their studies acquire the title of master bard and, if they choose to study at the school of New Olamn in the city of Waterdeep, receive the degree of Magnus Alumna upon completion of their studies.

Base of Operations: New Olamn (C72).  
New Olamn (Standard Scholastic): AL CG, NG; 15,000 gp resource limit; Membership 110; Mixed (humans 72, elves 11, half-elves 11, halflings 6, gnomes 5, dwarves 3, half-orcs 2); Dues 10 gp per month ( 50 gp to join).

Important Characters: Khallos Melshimber (LE male Tethyrian human expert 9); Jhandess Millomyr (CG female Tethyrian human bard 7/Harper agent ${ }^{\mathrm{PS}} 3$ ); Danilo Thann (see page 63 ).

Associated Classes: Bard, expert, rogue, sorcerer, wizard.  
Associated Skills: Decipher Script, Diplomacy, Knowledge (arcane), Knowledge (history), Perform, Use Magic Device.

Special: Admittance to New Olamn usually requires demonstrable musical talent (at least 4 ranks in Perform [any] or Skill Focus [Perform]).

### Watchful order of Magists \& Protectors

Technically, the Watchful Order is one of the city's forty-three guilds, formed to protect less powerful wizards and sorcerers from those distrustful of the Art, but in practice, it acts as the largest arcane academy in the City of Splendors. The Watchful Order encourages prudence in the use of the Art so that arcane spellcasters will be respected and looked up to, not feared and actively opposed. Effectively, it polices less powerful arcane spellcasters who reside in or visit the city, actively discouraging them from throwing spells around to influence the populace. Since many powerful arcane spellcasters are not members of the Watchful Order, the guild uses its influence to mitigate their most egregious behavior as well.

The Watchful Order provides many benefits to members, including forums for arranging instruction and trading in magical information, the sale of rare material components from the golem-guarded cellars of the Tower of the Order (C15), and a market for the buying and selling of spellcasting services, scrolls, and minor magic items. In addition, members of the guild can find regular employ as fire guards and spell guards. The Watchful Order contracts with building owners across the city to respond to fires with summoned water elementals, keeping half a dozen or so fire guards on duty every day. The guild also contracts with paranoid individuals of means to provide spell guards skilled in detecting and countering hostile workings of the Art. The guild's livery is a dark purple cloak, with a white human hand, fingers together and uppermost, on the left shoulder.

Base of Operations: Tower of the Order (C15).

Watchful Order of Magists \& Protectors (Expansive Arcane): AL All; 100,000 gp resource limit; Membership approximately 1,000; Mixed (humans 640, elves [all kinds] 120, shield dwarves 80 , lightfoot halflings 50 , half-elves 50 , gnomes [all kinds] 30 , half-orcs 20 , others 10); Dues $20 \mathrm{gp} /$ month ( 100 gp to join).

Authority Figure: Lady Master of the Order Mhair Szeltune (see below).

Important Characters: Speaker of the Order Orlar Thammas (CG male Illuskan human wizard 5/guild wizard of Waterdeep ${ }^{\text {Mag }} 7$ ).

Associated Classes: Adept, sorcerer, wizard.  
Associated Skills: Concentration, Craft (alchemy), Decipher Script, Knowledge (arcana), Spellcraft, Use Magic Device.

Requirements: You must craft at least one magic item for the guild each month; the item must be worth at least 25 gp . (Members who craft more expensive items are excused from this obligation for 1 month per 100 gp of the market price of the item crafted.) Donating a magic item is an acceptable substitute for crafting one. In addition, you must serve an average of 20 hours per tenday with the Guard, the Watch, or in similar protective duties.

Favored in Guild Fringe Benefit: The Order subsidizes your monetary expenses when you create magic items, reducing raw material costs by $10 \%$.

Special: Many members of the Watchful Order take the guild wizard of Waterdeep ${ }^{\text {Mag }}$ prestige class, which requires an additional initiation fee of $1,000 \mathrm{gp}$ and carries with it-different responsibilities and privileges. The requirements and dues given above apply to rank-and-file members.

Most of the rank-and-file members of the Watchful Order are sorcerers or wizards who pay their dues and provide the minimal service required to be a member in good standing. A fair number of guild members don't bother to keep up with their dues and service, and are content to simply register their affiliation once and then go about their business. Most of the guild's positions of responsibility are filled by characters who actually have the guild wizard of Waterdeep prestige class; these individuals enjoy a much stronger voice in guild affairs than those who just pay their dues or take the Favored in Guild feat without pursuing the prestige class.

Mhair Szeltune: Mhair (NG female Illuskan human wizard 5/guild wizard of Waterdeep ${ }^{\text {Mag }} 10 /$ archmage 4) is a petite, lithe woman with long, glossy black hair and deep, royal blue eyes. A serene, efficient lady of iron will and persistence, she can be a kind and loyal friend or a harsh, dangerous enemy. As Lady Master of the Order, she heads the Watchful Order of Magists \& Protectors. She often wanders the city in the illusory guise of an old crone, surreptitiously checking to see what kind of treatment she receives. She is an uncanny judge of character and has never assessed anyone wrongly in the politics and power plays among (and within) the guilds.

### Other Practitioners

Although most arcane spellcasters of lesser or middling power join the Watchful Order, many powerful loners call the city home as well. While the most famous independent Waterdhavian wizard is undoubtedly Halaster Blackcloak, others less well known deserve attention as well. Among the ranks of the nobility are Lord Huld Belabranta, Lady Hlanta Melshimber, Lady Alathene Moonstar, Lady Thyriellentha Snome, Telbran Nelarn (although his relationship with the Cragsmere family is unknown), Lady Nleera Tarannath Tesper, Lord Baerom Thunderstaff II, Lord Maskar Wands, and Lady Olanhar Wands. Several notable lone practitioners resident in Waterdeep are detailed below.

Dagsumn: Gaunt and ghostly pale, Dagsumn (LN male Illuskan human wizard 7) is an austere man of moderate height, given to bulky blue and green robes. Despite his apparent physical failings, he is a skilled practitioner of the Art with a hunger for magical power. Dagsumn hails from Port Llast and had a brief apprenticeship with Malchor Harpell at the Tower of Twilight. While the two did not part company as enemies, they have not spoken in over twenty-five years. Dagsumn came to Waterdeep to make his fortune, but his brief adventuring career gave way long ago to casting spells and tutoring lesser mages for fees. He

---

can usually be found at the Elfstone Tavern (C32) and keeps an apartment nearby with his wife, Kyrss Wands.

Dagsumn prefers to engage in spellcasting in the City of the Dead, protected by hired guards, where few can glean his secrets through observation. While friendly and trustworthy enough to honor any contract, Dagsumn is a stickler for details. Although he is capable of creating his own magic items and spells, Dagsumn would much prefer to collect them in payment with a minimum of risk or expended gold. He can be somewhat of a bore and pest when he catches wind of a new item, belaboring others for details.

Kappiyan Plurmastyr: Kappiyan (NG male Tethyrian human wizard 7/master alchemist ${ }^{584}$ 10/Loremaster 3) is a tall, thin, dignified man over a century in age with white hair and beard, bushy eyebrows, and a childlike gleam in his eyes. Despite his messy line of work, he always wears immaculate gray robes. He recently married his long-time apprentice, Shalara Malarrkin, and these two "potion wizards" dwell in quiet-comfort in a modest home in Southern Ward (S10). Kappiyan sells potions and periapts to fund his Mystra-blessed research, but he frowns on repeat customers who darken his doorstep more than once every few months. Because his domicile is frequently the target of thieves, Kappiyan has an array of magical guardians deployed about his home, and he is never without an array of wands and potions on his person.

Tessalar Hulicorm: Tessalar (LN male Illuskan human wizard 18) is a high-voiced, bearded, vain man given to wearing large amounts of gleaming costume jewelry, who nonetheless is a respected and well-liked figure at the galas of Sea Ward. He often prepares elaborate illusion and pyrotechnics for a sponsoring noble (whose praise and political support is now more important to Tessalar than money). Tessalar lacks obvious enemies, but he still seems unwilling to trust anyone, to the point of paranoia. Many have correctly divined that Tessalar has aspirations of founding his own noble house, and more than one established patriarch has used this fact to his advantage.

Tessalar used to be a mercenary mage who tutored and cast spells in exchange for treasure, which he then used to further his research into the making of various magic items. After one fateful trip to Undermountain, he came back richer than any man in his generation, laden with emeralds the size of goose eggs. He still makes and sells potions and scrolls, and he always demands payment in advance for unusual varieties (half in advance, half upon pickup-he never delivers). Tessalar rarely leaves his home ( $\$ 2 \mathrm{~F}$ ) except to attend parties, and his magical defenses daunt even the most powerful thieves.

Unbeknownst to all, Tessalar acquired his fortune by looting the hoard of the slumbering Vulharindauloth (an ancient male black dragon), who now dwells in an extensive network of flooded caverns beneath Skull Pool in Skullport. Aware that Vulharindauloth is actively looking for the thief who stole his hoard, Tessalar is becoming increasingly anxious about his safety, to the point of anonymously expending large amounts of coin to hire as-yet-unsuccessful dragon hunters to dispatch the wyrm.

Telbran Nelarn: Telbran (CN male Netherese human sorcerer 24), most commonly known today as Hurlblar Corthyn, is a quiet man, small in stature, with pale skin and jet-black hair. His deep  
blue eyes suggest a man who has seen almost everything and lived. Before the fall of Netheril, Telbran Nelarn was a scullery knave in the kitchens of the Ensul Thruin, a quiet Netherese scholar of the relationship between the Weave and the forces of the natural world. Telbran's sorcerous powers were awakened after a jealous rival threw down his master's tower. After fleeing into the wilderness, Telbran survived using a spell he learned from a purloined tome of his master, Ensul's soultheft ${ }^{6}$. In time, Telbran adopted the life of a traveling trader, using his magic to extend his life or eliminate foes as needed.

As the centuries passed, Telbran came to restrict his soultheft to evil arcane spellcasters who, in his view, preyed on others. Eventually Telbran came to Waterdeep, where he has dwelled ever since, having fallen in love with its color, bustle, and intrigue. Seeking privacy, leisure, and the resources to pursue his studies of magical lore and history, Telbran set about amassing a fortune soon after his arrival in the City of Splendors. A few quick soulthefts won him the coins of some merchants and smugglers, which he used to buy buildings and as lending capital. Telbran made sure to position himself as a generous, wealthy man willing to loan money to nearly anyone and willing to forgive small difficulties in paying.

Telbran changed names often, to conceal his rise to wealth, before settling on' Raeraeth Cragsmere. His life took an unexpected detour when he met and married Salarma Meldart, an Athkatlan dressmaker, and she bore him five sons and two daughters. Telbran set aside his studies to raise his family, keeping sorcerous watch over their doings and drinking the lives of those who worked them ill. He also redoubled his wealth-building to amass a fortune for his progeny, seizing more coin and properties from his victims. In time, the Cragsmeres grew very wealthy and influential, while "Raeraeth" retreated into the background, assuming the role of aged family patriarch. When Salarma died, Telbran faked his own death soon after, retreating into a succession of shapes and identities. He moved from property to property, always watching over his descendants, while guiding them into the ranks of the city's nobility.

Telbran now views Waterdeep as a garden in need of tending, and believes his killing of evildoers is simply a much-needed weeding. He is a sorcerer of considerable power who can read and write many languages, and he knows more Realmslore than most sages ever learn. He lives quietly, most often in the guise of "Hurlblar Corthyn," a book collector who dwells in modest upper rooms above Ragathan Furriers (N43).

Savengriff: Savengriff (LG male Illuskan human wizard 20) is a plain-featured man with hazel eyes, pale skin, and dark brown hair and beard. Once a member of the Company of Crazed Venturers, he perished in battle with a beholder before his companions retrieved his remains and brought him back to life. He became a loyal apprentice of Khelben and, in time, a loyal agent of the Harpers and a mage of accomplishment. His signature creation is the staff of banishment ${ }^{6}$, of which he has created at least a dozen copies.

For years, Savengriff wandered the North, serving the Harpers, returning to Waterdeep only occasionally. In time, he took to exploring the planes, and his ties with the Harpers slowly faded. In the Year of Wild Magic ( 1372 DR), Savengriff returned to

---

Waterdeep and took a room at the Inn of the Dripping Dagger (T3). Although he still maintains his ties with Those Who Harp (and the Tel Teukiira as well), he now has a new loyalty. During his travels Savengriff located the long-absent and legendary Prespur and Grimwald. After lengthy discussions, the three agreed to reinvigorate the ancient cabal of good-aligned mages known as the Covenant. Savengriff is the first to return to Faerûn, and he is actively, seeking like-minded mages of power to join this ancient brotherhood.

### Maaril the Dragon Mage

Given to wearing dark green or purple robes, the Dragon Mage of Waterdeep is a handsome, dark-eyed wizard with a jutting black beard curling from the point of his chin. Famed largely for his dragon-shaped tower ( $\$ 30$ ), Maaril is considered just one more eccentric, independent mage of note by most other wizards of the city. Khelben is a notable exception, having deduced Maaril's true nature in recent years, but he is hesitant to confront Maaril for the reasons detailed below.

Born in the Year of the Wandering Wyrm (1317 DR), Maaril was fostered in the House of Wonder ( $\$ 21$ ) and apprenticed at a young age to Lhoril Delhiirnyn, a mage who had survived the Guildwars and avoided exile. Once Maaril felt he had learned all he could from Lhoril, he summoned a demon to slay her and framed a rival apprentice for the murder. The infamous Dragon Tower of Maaril was once Lhoril's abode.

Maaril's many secrets included his legion of guardgoyle ${ }^{4}$ servitors, his recent mastery of the gate spell, and his never-ending efforts to seize magic items from overly boastful adventurers by  
![img-9.jpeg](assets/City%20of%20Splendors,%20Waterdeep_img-9.jpeg)  
means of such servitors. He has proven himself a quiet, patient, behind-the-scenes foe to all adventurers who retaliated against him, hiring endless sellswords to bar their way.

Maaril's greatest treasure is the dragonstaff of Alghairon, a legacy of Ahghairon stolen by Lhoril in the immediate aftermath of the legendary archmage's death and taken in turn by Maaril after he murdered his instructor. The Dragon Mage of Waterdeep holds the literal key to Alighairon's dragonward (see page 20), a fact that gives him a great deal of influence over the city's resident dragon population.

The Dragon Mage has many foes and few allies among the populace of Waterdeep, but nonetheless he is regularly invited to revels hosted by the Waterdhavian elite. Maaril has made himself sufficiently influential that it is dangerous to annoy him. The Dragon Mage bears a particular enmity for Duhlark Kolat (CG male Illuskan human transmuter 20), who briefly turned Maaril into a faerie dragon after Maaril goaded him into an ill-advised spell-duel. (Duhlark is the brother of Alcedor Kolat, who is mentioned on page 148 in connection with the quarterstaff of Alcedor and the amulet of Alcedor.) Maaril's closest friend is Meleghost Starseer, the Magister of Mystra at the House of Wonder (\$21).

Maaril has reached an understanding of sorts with most dragons that reside in the City of Splendors, for he always treats them with proper respect, and they reply in kind. Among those dragons that dwell outside the City of Splendors but seek to enter the city, Maaril is regarded with distrust, if not loathing, for he invariably frustrates such plans. As a result, the Dragon Mage must take significant precautions each time he exits the city.

Maaril's dragon cohort is Khavalanoth (LE male juvenile green dragon). The offspring of Chloracidara of Mhiilamniir and Grimnoshtasdrano the Riddling Dragon is pledged to serve the Dragon Mage until he becomes a young adult. Maaril's familiar is Frethian, a black cat.

Maaril the Dragon Mage: Male Illuskan human wizard 17/ archmage 1; CR 18; Medium humanoid; HD 18d4+18; hp 64; Init +4 ; Spd 30 ft.; AC 24, touch 16, flat-footed 20; Base Atk $+8 /+3 ;$ Grp +7 ; Atk +9 melee ( $1 \mathrm{~d} 6+1,+2$ quarterstaff); Full Atk $+7 /+2$ melee ( $1 \mathrm{~d} 6+1 / 1 \mathrm{~d} 6+1,+2 /+2$ quarterstaff); SA arcane fire, frightful presence, spells; SQ summon familiar; AL NE; SV Fort +8 , Ref +11 , Will +14 (+18 vs. frightful presence of good dragons); Str 8, Dex 18, Con 12, Int 19, Wis 10, Cha 17.

Arcane Fire (Su): Maaril can change arcane spell energy into arcane fire, manifesting it as a bolt of raw magical energy. The bolt is a ranged touch attack with long range ( 440 feet) that deals 1 d 6 points of damage plus 1 d 6 points of damage per level of the spell used to create the effect.

---

Frightful Presence (Ex): When Maaril attacks or charges, all opponents within 30 feet who have less than 18 Hit Dice become shaken for $1 \mathrm{~d} 6+3$ rounds. The effect is negated by a DC 22 Will save. A target that saves successfully is immune to Maaril's frightful presence for 24 hours. This ability can't affect creatures with Intelligence scores of 3 or lower, nor does it have any effect on dragons.

Possessions: Maaril's scaled bracers (bracers of armor +8), Maaril's mantle (cloak of Charisma +4), Maaril's gloves (gloves of Dexterity +4), Maaril's brooch (amulet of proof against detection and location), Maaril's dragonseye ring (ring of $x$-ray vision), Maaril's spelltome (Boccob's blessed book), ring of feather falling, dragonstaff of Abghairon (staff of power, 50 charges).

### Armed Forces

The Lords of Waterdeep enforce their rule and maintain peace and security through the city's armed forces. Waterdeep's defenders are divided into four branches: the Griffon Cavalry, the City Guard, the City Watch, and the Navy. The Gray Hands act as an elite company, called in for emergencies.

### Griffon Cavalry

Waterdeep's griffon-riders patrol high above the skies of Waterdeep, defending Mount Waterdeep and the city below against intrusion. The Griffon Calvary is an elite company of the City Guard, and its leader, Lord Moedt, reports directly to General Obryn Ironfist.

Base of Operations: Peaktop Aerie (C67).  
Griffon Cavalry (Standard Government): AL LN, N, LG; 40,000 gp resource limit; Membership 100; Isolated ( 95 human, 3 half-elf, 2 elf); Salary 15 gp/month (a "donation" of 500 gp to join is not unusual).

Special: Joining the Griffon Cavalry requires swearing an oath of loyalty to the city of Waterdeep. Prospective members must demonstrate proficiency in combat (a base attack bonus of at least +3 ) and know the Mounted Combat feat. The Griffon Cavalry is quite prestigious, and prospective members often have to arrange favors or make significant donations to civic causes in order to join.

Griffon riders are given griffon badges of Waterdeep ${ }^{a}$ on joining the company. They are issued griffon mounts and lances of burning blackfire ${ }^{a}$ in order to perform official duties, but may not use their mounts or magic weapons for personal reasons without obtaining special approval from Lord Moedt. Members of the Griffon Cavalry wear the same uniform as the Guard, but have a griffon emblazoned on their tabard.

### SAMPLE Griffon-Rider

A griffon-rider patrol consists of four griffon-riders and their mounts. They include a civilar (captain or lieutenant), an armar (sergeant), and two regular griffon-riders.

Griffon-Rider: Human fighter 6: CR 6; Medium humanoid; HD 6d10+12; hp 49; Init +1 ; Spd 20 ft . in banded mail (base 30 ft.); AC 19, touch 11, flat-footed 18; Base Atk +6 ; Grp +9 ; Atk +11 melee ( $1 \mathrm{~d} 8+6 / \times 3$ plus 1 d 6 fire plus 1 d 6 acid, +1 corrosive flaming heavy lance) or +10 melee ( $1 \mathrm{~d} 8+3 / 19-20$, masterwork longsword) or +8 ranged ( $1 \mathrm{~d} 6+3 / \times 3,+1$ composite shortbow); Full Atk $+11 /+6$ melee ( $1 \mathrm{~d} 8+6 / \times 3$ plus 1 d 6 fire plus 1 d 6 acid, +1 corrosive flaming heavy lance) or $+10 /+5$ melee ( $1 \mathrm{~d} 8+3 / 19-20$, masterwork longsword) or $+8 /+3$ ranged $(1 \mathrm{~d} 6+3 / \times 3,+1$ composite shortbow); AL varies; SV Fort +7 , Ref +3 , Will +4 ; Str 16, Dex 13, Con 14, Int 12, Wis 10, Cha 8.

### City Guard

The City Guard serves as Waterdeep's army, defending the City of Splendors from attack and patrolling the surrounding countryside. The Guard also serves as bodyguards for Piergeiron and

---

as honor guards for visiting diplomats. Contingents of the Guard and the Watch jointly man the city gates; the Guard controls access, while the Watch observes those who enter, pursues fugitives, and escorts visitors into the city.

Base of Operations: Castle Waterdeep (C76), Guard Armory (C47), Guard Barracks (C19, D56, N1), Piergeiron's Palace (C75), various towers and gatehouses surrounding the city.

City Guard (Expansive Government): AL LN, $\mathrm{N}, \mathrm{LG} ; 100,000 \mathrm{gp}$ resource limit; Membership 1,200 (can grow up to 12,000 by recruiting mercenaries in times of war); Mixed (humans 770, shield dwarves 130, elves [all kinds] 110, lightfoot halflings 70, half-elves 55 , gnomes [all kinds] 30 , half-orcs 25 , others 10); Salary $6 \mathrm{gp} /$ month (none to join).

Authority Figure: General Obryn Ironfist, son of Arn, blood of Turgo, of the Forlorn Hills of Dardath (LN male shield dwarf fighter 19).

Associated Classes: Barbarian, cleric, fighter, paladin, ranger, rogue, warrior.

Associated Skills: Climb, Handle Animal, Intimidate, Profession (siege engineer), Ride, Spot.

Requirements: You are expected to serve an average of 30 hours per tenday, standing guard, drilling, or patrolling. (Many Guards serve more.)

Favored in Guild Fringe Benefit: You learn tactics for fighting alongside other Guards. Whenever you are adjacent to another Guard, you both gain a +1 competence bonus to AC.

The uniform of the Guard is brightly polished chainmail, covered by black tabards with gold trim. Guards carry weapons appropriate to their posting, such as longswords, rods (treat as masterwork clubs), shortbows, shortspears, short swords, and daggers.

The Guard's ranks and command structure are similar to that of the City Watch (detailed below), except the army is apportioned not to wards but to various garrisons along the city wall, in Castle Waterdeep, Piergeiron's Palace, and in the surrounding countryside.

Madeiron Sunderstone: Madeiron (LG male Illuskan human paladin 15, Jotunbrud ${ }^{\text {Bac }}$ feat) stands an astonishing eight feet tall in height, a throwback to his Ostorian lineage. He keeps his head shaved and his muscular form lightly oiled, giving his opponents no chance to grab him in combat. Madeiron is famous for his polished blue full plate ( +1 bluesbine ${ }^{\text {Msp }}$ full plate), a greataxe known as the axe of heavenly fire (see page 147), and the 9 -foot-long iron bar (treat as a Large heavy mace) he uses for crowd control. He is virtually fearless, but  
not especially bright. However, his perseverance makes him a formidable foe.

Madeiron hails from Hartsvale, a small kingdom nestled in the mountains north of the Silver Marches. He is a distant cousin of the current royal family, tracing his lineage back to King Brun I, son of Hartkiller. Madeiron came to Waterdeep over two decades ago after a long and varied career as an adventurer in the Inner Sea lands. He rose through the ranks of the City Guard to become the Champion of Piergeiron, the Open Lord's personal bodyguard. Madeiron stays at Piergeiron's side in the Palace and outside the city, and he answers any challenges to the Open Lord with his own weapon.

### Sample City Guard

A Guard patrol consists of twelve members: a civilar (captain or lieutenant), an armar (sergeant), and ten Guardsmen or Guardswomen. Reinforcements rushing to a scene of a dispute might be on horseback.

Use the 4 th-levél fighter and 2ndlevel fighter NPCs from the Dungeon Master's Guide (page 117) to represent the typical guard civilar and armar, respectively.

City Guard: Human warrior 2: CR 1; Medium humanoid; HD $2 \mathrm{~d} 8+2$ plus 3; hp 14; Init +0 ; Spd 20 ft . in chainmail (base 30 ft .); AC 17 , touch 10 , flatfooted 17; Base Atk +2 ; Grp +3 ; Atk +5 melee ( $1 \mathrm{~d} 8+1 / 19-20$, masterwork longsword) or +4 melee ( $1 \mathrm{~d} 6+1$, masterwork club) or +2 ranged ( $1 \mathrm{~d} 6+1 / \times 3$, composite shortbow); AL varies; SV Fort +4 , Ref +0 , Will -1 ; Str 13, Dex 11, Con 12; Int 10, Wis 9, Cha 8.

### A Member of the City Guard at Bis post

### CITY NAVY

Heavily reliant on maritime trade, Waterdeep has long maintained a powerful navy capable of dominating its rivals along the Sword Coast and protecting its merchant shipping from pirates and monstrous threats.

Base of Operations: The navy is based in the Inner Fort (H4), the Outer Fort (H3), Smugglers' Bane Tower (H1), and Harborwatch Tower (H2), collectively garrisoned by almost a thousand marines at all times. The navy's fleet is based in the Naval Harbor.

City Navy (Expansive Government): AL LN, N, LG, NG, CG, LE, CN; 100,000 gp resource limit; Membership 2,000 (can

---

grow up to 9,000 by recruiting merchant sailors in times of war); Mixed (humans 1,380, elves [all kinds] 220, shield dwarves 140, lightfoot halflings 110, half-elves 80 , half-orcs 70 ); Salary $6 \mathrm{gp} /$ month (none to join).

Authority Figure: Admiral Helkar Hornwynd (LG male Illuskan human rogue 10/fighter 8 ).

Associated Classes: Barbarian, bard, cleric, expert, fighter, ranger, rogue, warrior.

Associated Skills: Balance, Climb, Knowledge (geography), Profession (sailor), Profession (siege engineer), Use Rope.

Requirements: You are expected to serve an average of 30 hours per tenday. This might involve several tendays away on a voyage, followed by a long leave in which you are free to do as you please.

Favored in Guild Fringe Benefit: You gain a +1 competence bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls while fighting on board a ship or boat.

In times of war, merchant sailors are press-ganged into the navy and "encouraged" to swear an oath of loyalty to Waterdeep.

The navy's fleet consists of 16 fast "rakers" (or dromonds), slim top-armored vessels usually armed with two fire-pot light catapults and two large deck-mounted ballistae that the guard uses with stunning accuracy against pirates and smugglers. These ships have armored bow rams, banks of oars, and two masts for crowding on sail in pursuit or when speed is essential. They are supported by twenty-four small lateen-sailed galleys, known as "strikers," and fifteen large, wallowing troop-and-supply vessels, or "transports." At least two naval rakers are always on patrol outside the harbor, and another two are on "ready" duty within the harbor. At least four others will be on extended patrol somewhere off the Sword Coast on any day in peacetime.

### City Watch

The City Watch serves as Waterdeep's police force, patrolling the city and ensuring the well-being of its inhabitants. In addition to arresting those who break the laws, Watch patrols often assist passersby with heavy loads, give directions, search for lost children, provide basic medical aid, and referee verbal disputes.

The commander of the watch is Captain Rulathon, who reports to Piergeiron. His senior commanders are Grand Givilar Derek Windsfire (NG male half-moon elf fighter 11), Mage Civilar Thyriellentha, and Senior Armsmaster Helve Urtrace. Each ward is commanded by a ward civilar and has a number of guard posts, each commanded by a senior civilar. Each patrol is commanded by a civilar, who reports to the local senior civilar. There is also one skulk (made up of a half-dozen rangers and rogues) per ward commanded by a Senior Skulk, and one arcanum (made up of a half-dozen sorcerers and wizards) per ward commanded by a Senior Watch-Wizard.

Base of Operations: Piergeiron's Palace (C76).  
City Watch (Expansive Government): AL LN, N, LG; 40,000 gp resource limit; Membership 1,600; Mixed (humans 1,020, shield dwarves 160 , lightfoot halflings 130 , half-elves 110 , elves  
[all kinds] 80, half-orcs 55, gnomes [all kinds] 35, others 10); Salary $5 \mathrm{gp} /$ month.

Authority Figures: Captain Rulathon (see below); Senior Armsmaster Helve Urtrace (see below).

Important Characters: Thyriellentha (see below); Ilph (CN male lightfoot halfling rogue 5/thief-acrobat ${ }^{\mathrm{C}, \mathrm{k}} 4$, Senior Skulk of Castle Ward); Olophin yn Zelmazzar (LG male Calishite human fighter 2/paladin 2 [Tyr], a senior civilar of the Trades Ward).

Associated Classes: Cleric, expert, fighter, paladin, ranger, rogue, sorcerer, warrior, wizard.

Associated Skills: Intimidate, Knowledge (local), Search, Sense Motive, Spot, Use Rope.

Requirements: You must spend 30 hours per tenday on duty.

Favored in Guild Fringe Benefit: You gain a +1 bonus on Diplomacy checks and Intimidate checks when dealing with any resident of Waterdeep in Waterdeep.

The uniform of the Watch is a doublet of leather armor studded with iron rings, under an overshirt of green, black, and gold. Members of the Watch are armed with light steel shields, clubs, daggers, and short swords.

The watch has access to the armories ( $\$ 75$ and C76) of the guard, the Palace (C75), and the wall-towers. All on-duty members can enter any building or area in the city without hindrance or warning and can search any person, place, or container at will, unless specifically forbidden by a Lord. Traditionally, certain areas are lightly patrolled, such as the docks, and others are heavily patrolled, such as the City of the Dead. If a watch patrol encounters a major disturbance, they will blow the distinctive "trembling" note horns they carry on their belts to summon aid, and one member of the patrol will immediately run to the nearest guard tower or guard post to spread the word, usually summoning additional aid from the guard of necessary.

If a watch patrol makes an arrest, two members of the patrol immediately escort the captive to a Magister, while the others continue patrolling. The watch prefers to disarm and capture suspects who do not surrender, but, in cases of great danger, lethal force is authorized. Afterward, speak with dead spells are employed on the dead to determine the truth and then resurrection spells are paid for by the city if necessary.

Emmer Jundhyl: Emmer (NG male Illuskan human rogue 1/fighter 7) is a large, beefy, outgoing man, given to great booming laughs and a ready smile. He is the watch civilar of North Ward and close friends with Regnet Amcathra and Scirkhel Wands (see page 63). Emmer has been recently replaced by Fengharl of the Unseen (NE doppelganger), but as yet no one has detected the change.

Mulgor of Tyr: Mulgor (LG male Illuskan human cleric 7 [Tyr]) is Waterdeep's collector-of-fees, a stolid, polite no-nonsense man who is escorted by the Watch while on his money-collecting rounds. He is diligent, inexorable, and never forgets a face, a name, or an unpaid fee. Those who slip out of the city without paying and return years later are confronted by a patient, courteous Mulgor. The Tyrran cleric officiates at ceremonies for the followers of Tyr in the Palace, but does not serve in the Halls

---

of Justice, believing that would compromise his role as collec-tor-of-fees. Mulgor lives in apartments in the Palace, one of few who actually live there other than Pierteeiron and his daughter, but ventures forth at least once a tenday to share an ale with old friends at the Elfstone Tavern (C32).

Rulathon: Captain Rulathon (LG male Chondathan human fighter 13) is a distinguished, gray-haired man of slight build and wiry, tough muscles. His square-jawed face is lined with wrinkles earned in the line of duty. He is fair, but tough, and willing to arrest troublemakers dozens of times until he either wins a conviction or drives them from the city in exasperation. As captain of the watch, reporting directly to the Open Lord, Rulathon represents the watch in Palace ceremonies and has overall command responsibility for the safety of the city. The captain is famed for taking a personal hand in tough fights, wading into battle in full plate armor bearing his famous Red Sword ( +4 defending longsword). In tight spots, Rulathon employs his iron born of Valballa, which both summons immediate reinforcements and alerts all members of the watch within earshot to come on the run.

Thyriellentha Snome: Mage Civilar Thyriellentha (LG female Illuskan human wizard 13) is a capable, friendly, and powerful woman. She can also be petty and grasping, seeking more power in all manner of legal ways. She has commanded the watch-wizard corps for nearly a decade, earning the ire of many subordinates for her strict, demanding standards. "Thyri," as she is known to friends, felt betrayed when her grandfather, Lord Arrabas Snome, chose her cousin Dandobar as his heir instead of her. Ever since, she has had little to do with her family, despite the fact that Dandobar has named her his heir.

Brace Ulmemur: Brace (CN male Chondathan human fighter 7) is a beefy, hard-faced man with an unlucky past. He is a loyal friend and has a sharp, biting wit, but, if crossed, will obsessively hunt down and kill the betrayer. Despite his fervent devotion to Lady Luck, every adventuring company Brace has been part of has been decimated by monsters while exploring ruins of the North. Brace is not greedy and quite dependable to those who treat him fairly, but he is mildly paranoid and distrustful of others that he does not know. Nevertheless, he has acquired a reputation of sorts ("kissed by Beshaba") that keeps him from finding regular employ in adventuring bands. As a result, Brace joined the City Watch to find a more regular source of income. Brace does not have a regular abode other than the city barracks (C19).

Helve Urtrace: Helve (LG male Tethyrian human fighter 6) is a quiet, rugged man with a scarred visage, an oft-broken pug nose, and missing teeth. While aged and balding, he can still put many of this watch recruits (and any taproom brawler) through their paces. Helve is the close-mouthed, always calm Senior Armsmaster of the City Watch, responsible for purchasing, maintaining, and keeping an account of all weapons used by officers of the watch. If one goes missing, he investigates. In tavern talk, he is said to put secret marks on all such weapons, but that is simply rumor. Helve also drills watch officers in the use of their arms, and is said to know every trick of tavernand street-fighting. If a watch patrol calls for reinforcements, and the reinforcements in turn have  
to blow their horns for additional reinforcements, Helve will almost certainly arrive. He carries a rod of smiting when on duty, and, when answering a summons to trouble, is often accompanied by his watch-wizard daughter, Lassree Urtrace (NG female Tethyrian human wizard 7), and a dozen or two additional watch officers.

### Sample Watch Patrol (EL 6)

A watch street patrol consists of four members: a civilar (captain or lieutenant), an armar (sergeant), and two watchmen or watchwomen.

Civilar (Captain): Human rogue 1/fighter 3: CR 4; Medium humanoid; HD 1d6+2 plus 3d10+6; hp 30; Init +3 ; Spd 30 ft.; AC 15, touch 9, flat-footed 15; Base Atk +3 ; Grp +6 ; Atk +8 melee ( $1 \mathrm{~d} 6+4 / 19-20,+1$ short sword) or +7 melee ( $1 \mathrm{~d} 6+3$, masterwork club); SA sneak attack +1d6; SQ trapfinding; AL varies; SV Fort +5 , Ref +2 , Will +4 ; Str 16, Dex 8, Con 14, Int 13, Wis 12, Cha 10.

Skills and Feats: Climb +5 , Diplomacy +4 , Gather Information +4 , Heal +4 , Intimidate +4 , Knowledge (local Waterdeep) +5 , Listen +5 , Ride +3 , Search +5 , Sense Motive +5 , Spot +6 , Use Rope +3 ; Combat Expertise ${ }^{6}$, Improved Disarm, Improved Initiative, Iron Will, Weapon Focus (short sword) ${ }^{8}$.

Languages: Chondathan, Common, Illuskan.  
Sneak Attack (Ex): A civilar deals an extra 1d6 points of damage on any successful attack against flat-footed or flanked targets, or against a target that has been denied its Dexterity bonus for any reason. This damage also applies to ranged attacks against targets up to 30 feet away. Creatures with concealment, creatures without discernible anatomies, and creatures immune to extra damage from critical hits are all immune to sneak attacks. A civilar can choose to deliver nonlethal damage with his sneak attack, but only when using a weapon designed for that purpose, such as a sap (blackjack).

Trapfinding (Ex): A civilar can find, disarm, or bypass traps with a DC of 20 or higher. He can use the Search skill to find, and the Disable Device skill to disarm, magic traps (DC $25+$ the level of the spell used to create it). If his Disable Device result exceeds the trap's DC by 10 or more, he discovers how to bypass the trap without triggering or disarming it.

Possessions: +1 chain shirt, light steel shield, +1 short sword, masterwork club, amulet of the watch ${ }^{9}$, potion of cure light wounds.

Armar (Sergeant): Human rogue 1/fighter 1: CR 2; Medium humanoid; HD 1d6+2 plus 1d10+2 plus 3; hp 18; Init +5 ; Spd 30 ft.; AC 16, touch 11, flat-footed 15; Base Atk +1 ; Grp +3 ; Atk +5 melee ( $1 \mathrm{~d} 6+2 / 19-20$, masterwork short sword) or +4 melee ( $1 \mathrm{~d} 6+2$, masterwork club); SA sneak attack +1 d 6 ; SQ trapfinding; AL varies; SV Fort +4 , Ref +3 , Will +1 ; Str 15, Dex 12, Con 14, Int 8, Wis 13, Cha 10.

Sneak Attack (Ex): An armar deals an extra 1d6 points of damage on any successful attack against flat-footed or flanked targets, or against a target that has been denied its Dexterity bonus for any reason. This damage also applies to ranged attacks against targets up to 30 feet away. Creatures with concealment, creatures without discernible anatomies, and creatures immune to extra damage from critical hits are all immune to sneak attacks. An armar can choose to deliver nonlethal damage with his sneak attack, but only when using a weapon designed for that purpose, such as a sap (blackjack).

Trapfinding (Ex): An armar can find, disarm, or bypass traps with a DC of 20 or higher. He can use the Search skill to find, and the Disable Device skill to disarm, magic traps (DC 25 + the level of the spell used to create it). If his Disable Device result exceeds the trap's DC by 10 or more, he discovers how to bypass the trap without triggering or disarming it.

### The Gray hands

Although Waterdeep is ably defended by the City Guard and City Watch, some threats require more extreme solutions. The Gray Hands are an elite force of high-powered adventurers who answer directly to the Lords of Waterdeep. Although their numbers are small, members of this group are capable of confronting the most powerful foes. The Lords of Waterdeep are loath to call on the Gray Hands unless no other option prevents itself, for the fallout from conflicts involving this group inevitably inflict a great deal of collateral damage on the City of Splendors.

Base of Operations: Blackstaff Tower (C6).  
The Gray Hands (Minor Mercenary): AL LG, LN, NG, CG; 15,000 gp resource limit; Membership 20; Mixed (human 16, half-elf 2, shield dwarf 1, frost giant 1); Salary $100 \mathrm{gp} /$ month (none to join).

Authority Figures: Jardwim (see below); Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun (LN male human [Chosen of Mystra] wizard 24/archmage 3, see page 53 ).

Important Figure(s): Asper (see below), Harshnag the Grim (see page 80), Hrusse of Assuran (see below), Carolyas Idogyr (see page 38 ).

Associated Classes: Barbarian, cleric, fighter, ranger, sorcerer, wizard.

Associated Skills: Climb, Concentration, Intimidate, Knowledge (the planes), Listen, Spot.

Requirements: You must be present in Waterdeep at least 30 hours per tenday. The Gray Hands do not patrol or stand duty; they're called when they're needed.

Favored in Guild Fringe Benefit:. You gain a +1 morale bonus on all saving throws made in Waterdeep or within 10 miles of the city.

---

Special: A prospective member must demonstrate excellent combat skills or powerful spellcasting to join the Gray Hands (minimum +5 base attack bonus or 3rd-level spells). Members of the Gray Hands usually adopt the Gray Hand enforcer prestige class as soon as possible.

Asper: Asper (CG female Illuskan human sorcerer 1/fighter 8) is a lithe, petite beauty, soft-spoken yet merry, and a great contrast to her voluminous husband Mirt. Although not formally part of the Gray Hands, this daring worshiper of Lady Luck adventures with them enough to be considered an honorary member of the team.

Hrusse of Assuran: Hrusse (LN male Mulan human cleric 14/Gray Hand enforcer 1 [Assuran/Hoar]) is a sallow-skinned exile from Unther, banished from his homeland by the theocrats of Gilgeam ere the god-king's fall. He is vengeful, intense and driven, never forgetting a slight or provocation. Hrusse has adopted Waterdeep as his own, avenging the city "in the eyes of Assuran" whenever it or the Lords is insulted or damaged.

Carolyas Idogyr: Carolyas (LG female half-moon elf sorcerer 14) is the wild, magic-hurling heart of the Gray Hands, who joined the group to escape the strictures of life as a watch-wizard. She has curly flame red hair she lets run wild and flashing green eyes that burn with power. The niece of Gamalon Idogyr (Tethyr's Court Sage and Count of Spellshire), Carolyas often clashes with Khelben over his conservative views on the use of magic.

Jardwim: Jardwim (NG male Illuskan human ranger 15/Gray Hand enforcer 3 [Mielikki]) has shoulder-length black hair, a Van Dyke beard, and a stocky, muscular build. His skin retains a grayish cast from being petrified by the original Xanathar. Jardwim is the ruthless, indomitable leader of the Gray Hands, who believes that if his team is needed, any resistance should be met by lethal force. He hates losing or even being fooled by anything. His concentration on the task at hand is legendary. Two blink dogs usually accompany the ranger. (Although Jardwim is the official leader of the group, he reports to Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun.)

Maliantor: Maliantor (NG female Tethyrian human wizard 10/Gray Hand enforcer 3) has long, braided brown hair, sea-green eyes, and an impish smile. She favors practical breeches, tunics, and twin baldrics stuffed with scroll cases. As a former student of Khelben often referred to as "Blackstaff's Eyes," Maliantor is rumored to be one of his main agents outside the Tel Teukiira, in addition to her work with the Gray Hands.

### Churches and

### Religious Orders

Polytheistic Waterdeep is home to all manner of faiths. The city's largest temples include the Font of Knowledge (Oghma, C4), the Halls of Justice (Tyr, C5), the House of Heroes (Tempus, \$58), the House of Inspired Hands (Gond, \$38), the House of the Moon (Selûne, \$56), the House of Wonder (Mystra, \$21), the Shrines of Nature (Silvanus and Mielikki, \$5), the Spires of the Morning (Lathander, C1), the Temple of Beauty (Sune, \$10), the Tower of Luck (Tymora, \$19), and the Plinth (all faiths, T38). Temples to dark gods, such as Ghaunadaur, Loviatar, and

Shar, are said to lie in the depths of Undermountain. The City of Splendors is also home to religious orders such as the Order of the Aster (Lathander), the Order of the Blue Moon (Selûne), the Order of the Sun Soul (Lathander, Selûne, Sune), the Order of the Even-handed (Tyr), and the Holy Order of the Knights of Samular (Tyr). The following is a brief accounting of the various faiths active in Waterdeep.

### Church of Cyric

The church of Cyric considers Mount Waterdeep sacred to the Dark Sun, for it was here that Cyric's ascension took place in front of the watchful eyes of Waterdeep's populace. The Dark Sun's more fanatic devotees make regular pilgrimages to the City of Splendors. Waterdhavians have never flocked to the Dark Sun's banner, but many rich Waterdhavians winter in the warmer climes of Amn, where the church of Cyric is strong. The interest of a few of these well-off individuals in the decadent practices of the South ensures Cyric's clerics a steady stream of noble patrons willing to fund activities in Waterdeep. Three of the more prominent Cyricists to frequent the City of Splendors are described below.

Malchior of Darkhold: Malchior (CE male Chondathan cleric 13 [Cyric]) is a fat, fleshy, gray-bearded man whose cunning is matched only by his greed. Malchior's first loyalty is to himself; the Dark Sun is a distant second. Although he remains part of the Zhentarim, Malchior rarely returns to Darkhold these days, a place that has fallen increasingly under the sway of the church of Bane. The Cyricist is a master manipulator who enjoys bending others to his will. Malchior regularly exercises influence over the judgments of Dag Zoreth (see "Bronwyn Caradoon," page 74), Bronwyn's brother, and Sir Gareth Cormaeril (see page 49) through a combination of blackmail, careful prevarication, and charisma.

Xorla Djannas: Xorla (CE female Tethyrian human illusionist 7/arcane devotee ${ }^{\mathrm{PG}} 5$ [Cyric]) is a native of southern Tethyr who ventured north to Waterdeep with her master Selpar Thynn, but she was abandoned when Thynn died in a tavern brawl. Xorla found her true calling at the end of the Time of Troubles. Having observed the ascendance of Cyric to godhood, she pledged herself to be one of his first and most devoted followers. In the years since her conversion, Xorla has wandered Faerûn in service to the Dark Sun, spreading word of her faith and collecting lost tomes of arcane lore for the church of Cyric. Nevertheless, she often returns to Waterdeep to pray at the spot where Cyric finally received his due.

Tomas Siohcen: Tomas (NE male Chondathan human cleric 5 [Cyric]) is a thin man with a pockmarked face given to frequenting the Dock Ward's dreariest taverns in dark, hooded robes. Tomas harbors a deep and abiding hatred for the Church of Talona, for he suffered greatly as the slave of a Talona-worshiping Calishite in his youth. Tomas sees the Unseen as the perfect expression of the Dark Sun's teachings and his enthusiastic support for the druuth's war against the Lords of Waterdeep is simply a front for his long-term goal of building a cathedral to the Dark Sun atop Mount Waterdeep at the sight of Cyric's ascension.

### Church of Gond

Waterdeep has long been a bastion of enterprising artisans and craftsfolk, many of whom worship the Wonderbringer. Merchants from Lantan are believed to have first introduced the teachings of Gond to the settlement, and their teachings were in large part responsible for the ascendance of Waterdeep's mercantile culture. The Waterdhavian branch of the church has long benefited from the generous donations of Waterdeep's prosperous tradesfolk.

In recent years, as Waterdeep's economic troubles have multiplied, donations to the church's coffers have fallen off, undermining the authority of the temple's leaders with respect to the rest of the faith. In response, High Seeker Jhoadil Zulthind has partnered with the Splendid Order of Armorers, Locksmiths, \& Finesmiths, the Guild of Stonecutters, Masons, Potters, \& Tile-Makers, and the Watchful Order of Magists \& Protectors to begin actively marketing constructs to the wealthiest Waterdhavians, attempting to corner the market for such devices. Smiths, stonemasons, and sorcerers across the city are now employed in the fabrication of caryatid columns ${ }^{\mathrm{PF}}$, dread guards ${ }^{\text {MM }}$, guardgoyles", helmed horrors ${ }^{\mathrm{MF}}$, iron golems, nimblewrights ${ }^{\text {MM }}$, shield guardians, and stone golems.

Base of Operations: House of Inspired Hands (\$38).  
Church of Gond (Expansive Religious): AL any; 100,000 gp resource limit; Membership 340; Mixed (humans 255, rock gnomes 60 , shield dwarves 10 , half-elves 10 , halflings 5 ); Dues $5 \mathrm{gp} /$ month (none to join).

Authority Figure: High Seeker Jhoadil Zulthind (see below).  
Associated Classes: Cleric, expert, fighter, rogue, wizard.  
Associated Skills: Concentration, Craft (any), Knowledge (architecture and engineering), Knowledge (religion), Spellcraft, Use Magic Device.

Requirements: You must craft an item worth at least 2 gp and donate it to the temple once per month. You must also adhere to the tenets of Gond's faith.

Favored in Guild Fringe Benefit: The church subsidizes the costs of any construct or magic item you create, reducing your raw material costs by $10 \%$.

Special: Admittance to the clergy of Gond usually requires demonstrable understanding of the church's teachings ( 2 ranks in Knowledge [religion]) and a vow of devotion to the Wonderbringer.

Many members of the clergy are instructed in the Initiate of Gond feat, once they qualify.

High Seeker Jhoadil Zulthind: Jhoadil (N female Lantanna human cleric 10/techsmith ${ }^{\mathrm{PF}} 5$ [Gond]) is a plump, green-eyed, copper-haired woman, with the characteristic parchment-colored skin of her ancestors. She projects the amiable-almost grand-motherly-air of someone is a tinkerer with little ambition. In truth, she is extremely strong-willed and driven, consumed with the same drive that leads some to become master artisans. In the High Seeker's case, she seeks acknowledgement as the preeminent cleric of Gond in western Faerûn. Jhoadil has just begun a secret project to automate the creation of golem body parts (thus creating half-golems ${ }^{\mathrm{PF}}$ ) despite the risks of doing so.

Jhoadil is convinced that she can succeed where those before her have failed, but she has kept such investigations secret from her construct-making partners who might disapprove of her new line of inquiry.

### Church of Tathander

Although humankind has dwelt in the shadow of Mount Waterdeep since the abandonment of Aelinthaldaar, the City of Splendors has retained the energy of an up-and-coming commercial center full of promise for generation upon generation. This spirit of renewal is both in harmony with the teachings of the Morninglord and the primary reason so many Waterdhavians embrace the teachings of Lathander. As a result, the Church of Lathander is one of the leading churches of Waterdeep.

The Church of Lathander is divided into three factions, although there is little discord between the three: the clergy of Lathander, the Order of the Aster, and the Order of the Sun Soul. The clergy focus primarily on ministering to the faithful. The Order of the Aster encompasses the Morninglord's holy warriors, dedicated to the destruction of evil undead and the defense of the clergy. The Order of the Sun Soul is not formally part of the Morninglord's church, as it claims equal allegiance to the churches of Selûne and Sune, but in truth, this monastic brotherhood has long been primarily associated with the followers of Lathander. However, the Waterdhavian branch of the Sun Soul Order has recently begun espousing a heresy that might eventually lead to a split among the three branches of the Morninglord's church.

### Clergy of Lathander

The clergy of Lathander are considered by the followers of the Morninglord to be the Church of Lathander, encompassing both the Order of the Aster and the Lathander-worshiping members of the Order of the Sun Soul. In practice, however, the cleric faction of the Morninglord's church encompasses only those individuals who are not members of the other two factions. The clergy of Lathander concern themselves primarily with the encouragement of the arts and acting as patrons for artists, performers, and craftsfolk.

Base of Operations: Spires of the Morning (C1).  
Clergy of Lathander (Expansive Religious): AL LG, NG, CG; 100,000 gp resource limit; Membership 320; Isolated (humans 292, half-elves 13, halflings 9, others 6); Dues $2 \mathrm{gp} /$ month (none to join).

Authority Figure: High Radiance Ghentilara (see below)  
Important Characters: Bamaal Dunster (NG male Tethyrian human cleric 6 [Lathander]); Prior Athosar (LG male Tethyrian cleric 5/morninglord of Lathander ${ }^{\mathrm{PG}} 3$, Ghentilara's ambitious underling).

Associated Classes: Cleric, fighter, monk, paladin.  
Associated Skills: Concentration, Diplomacy, Heal, Knowledge (nobility and royalty), Knowledge (religion), Spellcraft.

Requirements: You must tithe $10 \%$ of the profits of any new undertaking or 50 gp per month, whichever is less. This is in addition to the normal dues you pay. You must adhere to the tenets of Lathander's faith.

Special: Admittance to the Church of Lathander usually requires demonstrable understanding of the church's teachings ( 2 ranks in Knowledge [religion]) and a vow of devotion to the Morninglord,

Senior members of the order usually adopt either the morninglord of Lathander ${ }^{\mathrm{PG}}$ or sunmaster ${ }^{\mathrm{L} E}$ prestige class.

Ghentilara: Sunrise Lord Ghentilara (LG elderly female Chondathan human cleric 6/morninglord of Lathander ${ }^{\mathrm{PG}} 10$ [Lathander]) is the aging high priestess of the Spires of the Morning. Ghentilara still has the smooth, olive-hued complexion of a young girl from her native Chondath, but her long braided hair has turned snow-white over the years. Although she is strict and has little patience for mischief or blasphemy, Ghentilara is much beloved by her congregation. Ghentilara is as comfortable tending to an ill family in a small hovel in Dock Ward as she is while attending the most extravagant gala of the year, and she makes time for both in her busy days. Although she is increasingly uncomfortable with the preaching of Hanor Kichavo of the Sun Soul Order, she has yet to break publicly with him, fearing that such a split would divide the church and undermine its effectiveness.

Mhaere Dryndilstann: Mhaere (NG female Illuskan human cleric 5 [Lathander]) is the quiet, devoted, iron-willed wife of Durnan the Wanderer. She hails from Neverwinter, where she was raised by an uncle who served as a priest of the Morninglord. Mhaere's hands are skilled in both healing and dealing death in battle. Her skills are frequently called upon to heal dying adventurers as they are hoisted out of Undermountain, and she has been known to drop a coin to those in desperate need of a way up from the bottom of the shaft when Durnan is not looking.

### Order of the Aster

The Order of the Aster serves as the church army of the faithful of Lathander. In alliance with devotees of the Moonmaiden and other like-minded deities, members of the order, sometimes known as Soldiers of the Light, continue their eternal battle with the forces of darkness and destruction, specifically the followers of Bane, Shar, and Talos.

Each member of the Order of the Aster is assigned to a company of the Morninglord's church army. Each company is housed in one of a dozen or so church-sponsored abbeys scattered across western and central Faerûn. Companies are dispatched by the commanding abbot to battle enemies of the faith, usually in response to an entreaty from a high-ranking cleric of the Morninglord. Between tours of service, members of the order are frequently given leave to pursue their own goals. Most spend their time defending individual temples of the Morninglord, but some serve the faith by becoming adventurers. In Waterdeep, many members of the Order of the Aster contribute to the defense of the City of Splendors by serving in the City Guard.

Base of Operations: Spires of the Morning (C1).

Order of the Aster (Standard Religious): AL LG, NG; 15,000 gp resource limit; Membership 80; Isolated (humans 75, half-elves 3, halflings 1, other 1); Dues $50 \mathrm{gp} /$ month (none to join).

Authority Figures: High Dawnknight Tlinthar Regheriad (LG male Illuskan paladin 16); Dawnknight Alaura Cartier (LG female Tethyrian paladin 14); Dawnknight Haurier Brightshadow (NG male Tethyrian fighter 5/cleric 5/morninglord of Lathander ${ }^{\mathrm{PG}} 6$ [Lathander]).

Special: Admittance to the Order of the Aster usually requires demonstrable understanding of the church's teachings ( 4 ranks in Knowledge [religion]) and fighting skill (base attack bonus of at least +3 ), as well as a vow of devotion to the Morninglord.

Most members of the order are instructed in the Disciple of the Sun ${ }^{\mathrm{GS}}$ feat, once they qualify. Senior members of the order usually adopt either the morninglord of Lathander ${ }^{\mathrm{PG}}$ or sunmaster ${ }^{\mathrm{L} E}$ prestige class.

Jandar Ilbaereth: Jandar (LG male moon elf wizard 7/arcane devotee ${ }^{\mathrm{PG}} 2$ [Lathander]) is tall, thin moon elf with fair, bluetinged skin, silver-white hair, and striking gold-flecked purple eyes. He joined the Foes of the Fang in the Year of Maidens (1361 DR) to help rid the northern frontiers of a heretofore unknown plague of vampires. Jandar met his future wife, Corinna Lathankin, during his adventuring years when she joined the Foes of the Fang. After disappearing in Mirabar, Jandar returned to alert his comrades-at-arms to the presence of a troupe of vampires in Mirabar. The Foes of the Fang destroyed the charm, but they were forced to slay Jandar as well when it became apparent that he too had become one of the undead. After his resurrection, Jandar rejoined the group as a living member. The elf and his wife are the only surviving members of the now-defunct group, as the others died destroying a vampire in Castle Khommel in the Gray Peak Mountains several years past. Jandar joined the Order of the Aster upon his return, intent on reshaping the order into the most efficient vampire-hunting army ever seen.

Corinna Lathankin: Corinna (LG female half-moon elf wizard 3/cleric 3/Mystic Theurge 10 [Lathander]) has a beautiful, waiflike figure and soft face that belie her intense energy and loud, commanding voice. Corinna is a highly emotional woman who focuses her passions into her spells and activities. The illegitimate daughter of a minor noble, she grew up at the Spires of the Morning (C1) and has dedicated her life to the worship of Lathander and the destruction of vampires. Corinna is married to Jandar Ilbaereth, and remains close with Olanhar Wands (see page 63), who tutored her in the Art. Like Jandar, Corinna was until recently a member of the now-defunct Foes

---

of the Fang and joined the Order of the Aster upon her return to Waterdeep.

Corinna continues to rely on her half-brother, Djarrus Gost (NG male Chondathan human aristocrat 6, now charmed), for news and information of vampire activity in western Faerûn. Unbeknownst to anyone but Corinna and Jandar, Djarrus was the silent patron of the Foes of the Fang, donating money and resources to the group's efforts and supplying them with information about ongoing vampire activity in the North. Of course, Corinna would be horrified to learn that Djarrus is a charmed servant of Artor Morlin, receiving the bulk of his information from the master vampire of Waterdeep.

### Order of the Sun Soul

During the Age of Netheril, the Netherese venerated Amaunator, Keeper of the Eternal Sun, as the lord of bureaucracy, contracts, law, order, sun, and rulership. An order of itinerant monks known as the Brotherhood of the Sun served the faithful in the field, bringing the comforting words of Amaunator to the peasants and common folk. Although the Brotherhood of the Sun survived the fall of Netheril and the death of the Yellow God, it never coalesced around a successor to Amaunator. Instead, each monastery chose its own god to serve, with most eventually gravitating to Lathander (god of dawn) or Selûne (goddess of the moon and stars), but a few choosing Sune Firehair.

Today, the Brotherhood of the Sun is known as the Order of the Sun Soul, and the group's original association with the Church of Amaunator has been largely forgotten. The order now admits both men and women, but retains its itinerant nature and ancestral focus on serving the common folk of the Realms.

The Order of the Sun Soul maintains a large monastery in the city of Waterdeep, due in large part to the presence of prominent churches of Lathander, Selûne, and Sune. The order's current leader, Monastic Abbot Hanor Kichavo, is attempting to unify the three sects of the order into a cohesive whole for the first time in centuries. Drawing selectively on historical texts that survived the Netherese diaspora and the fall of Calimshan's Cajaan dynasty, he preaches that Lathander, Selûne, and Sune are tripartite fragments of Amaunator, and that the Yellow God shall rise anew once the three are unified to form the one.

Base of Operations: Monastery of the Sun (T46).  
Order of the Sun Soul (Standard Religious): AL LG, LN; 15,000 gp resource limit; Membership 144; Isolated (humans 124, halflings 12, half-elves 5 , others 3); Dues $2 \mathrm{gp} /$ month (none to join).

Authority Figure: Monastic Abbot Hanor Kichavo (see below).

Important Characters: Righteous Brother Hronkil Elgredsson (LN male Illuskan human paladin 8/Sun Soul monk ${ }^{\text {a }}$ 8); Righteous Sister Kadila adh Vitendi (see page 90 ).

Associated Classes: Fighter, monk, paladin.  
Associated Skills: Balance, Concentration, Heal, Listen, Knowledge (religion), Tumble.

Requirements: You must engage in charitable work among the poor, sick, and needy. This requires an average of 20 hours per tenday.

Favored in Guild Fringe Benefit: Lathander teaches that undead must be destroyed. Once per character level you can call upon your faith to enter a state of holy resolve, which lasts for 1 minute. While in this state, you gain a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls against undead.

Special: Admittance to the Order of the Sun Soul usually requires demonstrable athleticism ( 2 ranks in Jump or Tumble, or the Athletic feat) and a vow of obedience to one of the three acknowledged patrons of the order.

Monks of the Sun Soul Order can gain levels in one other class and still progress as a monk as long as their monk level is their highest class level. Senior members of the order usually adopt the Sun Soul monk prestige class.

Hanor Kichavo: Monastic Abbot Hanor (LG male Tethyrian human monk 10/Sun Soul monk 10) keeps his head shaved and favors bright yellow robes. Although he has an easy smile, he speaks with the fervor of a true believer who finds himself called to be a teacher. Hanor is the spiritual heart of the Waterdhavian branch of the Order of the Sun Soul and one of only a handful of monks with a following across the order as a whole. Hanor has drawn the ire of Waterdeep's powerful churches of Lathander, Selûne, and Sune for his heretical preaching, a feeling echoed by the more traditional members of his order. More than one rumor has spread through the City of Splendors suggesting that the esteemed Monastic Abbot is in the thrall of the Lady of Loss and that his teachings are designed to weaken Waterdeep's good-aligned churches. Whether or not his actions lead to such a state, Hanor truly believes in what he preaches.

### Church of Loviatar

The Church of Loviatar has a large and growing body of adherents among the more decadent members of the Waterdhavian nobility, including several members of House Anteos and House Husteem. In the City of Splendors, worship of the Maiden of Pain has traditionally been confined to private homes and disreputable Dock Ward cellars, but the cult has flourished with the recent establishment of a new temple in the uppermost level of Undermountain.

Base of Operations: House of Pain (UM L1).  
Church of Loviatar (Standard Religious): AL LE, LN, NE; 15,000 gp resource limit; Membership 150; Isolated (humans 139, half-elves 7, halflings 2, others 2); Dues $10 \mathrm{gp} /$ month (none to join).

Authority Figure: High Whipmaster Hlethvagi Anteos (see below).

Important Character: Yolanda Shamat (see below).  
Associated Classes: Cleric, fighter, monk, ranger, rogue, warrior.

Associated Skills: Bluff, Concentration, Intimidate, Knowledge (religion), Sense Motive, Spellcraft.

Requirements: You must adhere to the tenets of Loviatar, and add to the poverty, misery, and suffering of the helpless. This requires an average of 20 hours per tenday.

---

Favored in Guild Fringe Benefit: Participation in Loviatar's rigorous observances has inured you to pain. Once per character level, you can enter a state of unholy suffering in which you gain damage reduction $2 /$ - and ignore the effects of being sickened or stunned. This state lasts for 1 minute.

Special: Admittance to the Church of Loviatar usually requires demonstrable understanding of the church's teachings ( 2 ranks in Knowledge [religion]) and a vow of devotion to the Maiden of Pain.

Most members of the clergy are instructed in the Initiate of Loviatar ${ }^{88}$ feat, once they qualify. Most Loviatan monks are members of the Disciples of the White Rod and instructed in the Pain Touch ${ }^{\mathrm{CR}}$ feat, once they qualify. Senior female members of the church usually adopt the maiden of pain ${ }^{90}$ prestige class.

Hlethvagi Anteos: High Whipmaster Hlethvagi Anteos (LE male Chondathan human cleric 10 [Loviatar]) is a fat, wispy-bearded, sinister little man who favors fine robes, silken sashes and waistcoats, bejeweled daggers, and fine whips. He enjoys only two things in life: inflicting pain and staying filthy rich. Hlethvagi has long led a doublelife in Waterdeep; his public persona is that of a somewhat prosperous warehouse-operator, carter, and moneylender who lives in a mansion in Sea Ward ( $\$ 68$ ) and runs a business based in Southern Ward (Sf1), but most of his fortune comes from his undercover trade run through a web of intermediaries. His minions have controlled the Long Dark Stair (UM L1)-a fabled, long-forgotten entrance to Undermountain-for nearly two decades. He rarely exposes himself to danger, and is never without a group of bodyguards.

After years of leading foul worship services to Loviatar in various cellars in Dock Ward, Hlethvagi funded the construction of a new temple in the northwestern chambers of Undermountain's first level in the Year of the Banner (1368 DR). The House of Pain (UM L1) is now a growing power in the upper reaches of Undermountain, guarded by the orcs of the Grinning Skull tribe. It is drawing increasing support from various disaffected nobles.

Yolanda Shamat: Yolanda (NE female Tethyrian human cleric 5/maiden of pain ${ }^{90} 4$ [Loviatar]) is a daunting figure: a tall, sturdily built woman in her late thirties with dark, swarthy features. She has pale blue eyes and midnight black hair that she  
braids and coils around sharp iron needles. Yolanda, or "Yola" as she is sometimes known, carries herself rigidly erect and moves with deliberate purpose, cowing everyone around with an icy stare. She serves as chamberlain for Lady Ellandra Tolbert (N female Illuskan human necromancer 14), an important financier of the church's activities in Waterdeep, who purchased Yolanda's release from slavery.

### Church of Mystra

Waterdeep has a strong tradition of both wizardry and sorcery. Waterdhavians inclined to worship one of the "arcane" faiths (Azuth, Mystra, Savras, or now Velsharoon) have traditionally favored the Lady of Mysteries, dating back to the establishment of the House of Wonder in the Year of Starlight (1215 DR).

In Waterdeep, the Church of Mystra has long played a secondary role to the Watch-  
![img-10.jpeg](assets/City%20of%20Splendors,%20Waterdeep_img-10.jpeg)  
ful Order of Magists \& Protectors because the sale of spells and magic items is traditionally the province of the guild, not the church. The relationship between guild and church has been upset in recent years by the growth of the Enclave of Red Magic and attempts by Meleghost Starseer, the temple's high priest, to reach out to the Red Wizards.

Waterdeep's Mystran church is closely allied with the Church of Selúne, and the two faiths work together to  
battle the followers of Shar. In the  
aftermath of the Time of Troubles, Meleg-  
host Starseer joined Naneatha Suaril in founding the Knights of the Blue Moon, in large part to remove High Moonknight Xale from his leadership role at the House of Wonder. Although Knights of the Blue Moon are officially welcome in the House of Wonder, Meleghost has made clear that he finds their presence distasteful.

Requirements: You must adhere to the tenets of Mystra's faith and craft one magic item per month of at least 25 gp value to donate to the church.

Favored in Guild Fringe Benefit: The church subsidizes your monetary expenses when you create magic items, reducing raw material costs to you by $10 \%$.

Special: Admittance to the Church of Mystra usually requires demonstrable understanding of the church's teachings ( 2 ranks in Knowledge [religion] and 2 ranks in Knowledge [arcana]) and a vow of devotion to the Mother of All Magic. No member of the church may have the Shadow Weave Magic ${ }^{\mathrm{PG}}$ feat.

Most members of the clergy are instructed in the Initiate of Mystra ${ }^{\mathrm{PG}}$ feat, once they qualify. Senior members of the order usually adopt either the arcane devotee ${ }^{\mathrm{PG}}$ or dweomerkeeper ${ }^{\mathrm{PP}}$ prestige class.

Ilbrost Mythyl: Ilbrost (NG male Tethyrian human cleric 3/enchanter 6/dweomerkeeper ${ }^{\mathrm{PG}} 3$ ) is an aging enchanter who deftly relies on his magic to maintain his prominent social position. Ilbrost is always immaculately groomed, with a wandthin mustache, sumptuous wizardly robes, and slicked-back, thinning gray hair. Ilbrost is the nominal leader of the cleric faction seeking to unseat Meleghost, but his lack of personal ambition for the job has kept him from rebelling strongly against his superior. Ilbrost is nervously attentive to the growing wave of dissatisfaction with Meleghost's leadership, seeking to position himself on the winning side, no matter who prevails.

Meleghost Starseer: Magister of Mystra Meleghost (LE male Chondathan necromancer 13/arcane devotee ${ }^{\mathrm{PG}} 5$ ) is the cruel, urbane master of the House of Wonder. He has long, slender fingers, a shaven head, and a neatly trimmed goatee. Given to long flowing robes adorned with runes, Meleghost is fiercely devoted to the Lady of Mysteries and her patronage of all avenues of arcane investigation, including necromancy. The Magister of Mystra is a close friend of the Dragon Mage Maaril and the leaders of the Eltorchul family, but he has never gotten along well with either the Blackstaff or the members of the Wands clan. Meleghost has a cold, formal relationship with Naneatha Suaril, high priestess of Selûne, and an icy, almost hostile, relationship with Xale of the Starry Glen of the Order of the Blue Moon (see page 83 ).

Of late, Meleghost has been reaching out to members of the Red Magic Enclave, despite the opposition of his longtime allies in the Watchful Order of Magists \& Protectors. Although the Magister of Mystra professes that he is simply observing his vow to the Lady of Mysteries and ministering to all the faithful, the long-standing campaign by some members of the clergy to remove him from his position as high priest has gathered strength as more and more guild members voice their discontent.

### Church of Oghma

Although the Binder has long been honored Waterdeep's bards, wizards, and sages, only recently has the church of Oghma achieved the status of a major faith among the populace of

Waterdeep. The faith's recent rise to prominence is the result of hard work and careful diplomacy by Savant Sandrew the Wise. House Estelmer gave generously to the construction of the Great Library, assembling the tomes in the Estelmer villa before the temple was completed.

In the Year of the Banner ( 1368 DR), the Font of Knowledge (C4) was finally completed, and the temple staff moved from its former temple, a row house on Swords Street, to the beautiful new structure. House Estelmer took the lead in collecting and organizing the collection of tomes and scrolls before the temple was even complete, allowing the church of Oghma to open the doors of the Great Library in possession of the greatest assemblage of books found in the City of Splendors.

Although the most valuable service offered to the city by the Binder's disciples is the Great Library, the informal result has been the creation of a "market square" for the city's notoriously independent sages. Because most recognized sages spend at least several hours each day among the stacks, adventurers in need of immediate information have taken to seeking out "the Council of Sages" in the Font of Knowledge.

The Church of Oghma is closely allied with the bardic college of New Olamn (C72) and receives a great deal of financial backing from members of House Estelmer and House Majarra. It is also closely lihked with the Scriveners', Scribes', \& Clerks' Guild, which hosts a small chapel to Deneir within its guildhall. A keyed two-way portal links a bricked-up archway in a scribes' chamber on the second floor of the Font of Knowledge (C4) and the library on the second floor of the Zoarstar (T25) to a library hidden in a secret chamber of the old dwarf hold in Undermountain's Maze Level (UM L5).

You must spend 1 hour in research or prayer in a temple devoted to Oghma to use this ability.

Special: Admittance to the Church of Oghma usually requires demonstrable understanding of the church's teachings ( 2 ranks in Knowledge [religion]) and a vow of devotion to the Binder.

---

Most members of the clergy are instructed in the Initiate of Oghma ${ }^{\mathrm{PG}}$ feat, once they qualify. Senior members of the clergy sometimes take several levels of the bard class.

Sandrew the Wise: Savant Sandrew (LN male Illuskan human cleric 12/divine disciple ${ }^{\mathrm{PG}} 2$ [Oghma]), formerly of the Silver Marches, came to Waterdeep nearly a decade ago, intent on constructing a temple and library worthy of the Binder and the City of Splendors. He brought with him a handful of clerics from his old temple in Silverymoon, and he has continued to recruit additional clerics and librarians.

### Church of Selûne

The church of Selûne is one of the city's oldest faiths, as followers of the Moonmaiden have worshiped on the slopes of Mount Waterdeep since the Year of the Half Moon ( 390 DR). During the time of Bloodhand Hold, the church was known as the Cult of the Howling Moon, made up of good-aligned lycanthropes who gathered at what is now the Dancing Court. The cult was driven from the city by Nimoar the Reaver, but subsequently returned.

In the Year of the Gleaming Crown (1097 DR), two years after donating the Plinth (T38) to the Lords of Waterdeep, Selûnites began worshiping at the newly constructed High House of Stars (see Vault of Stars, page 120). The temple stood until the Year of the Tomb ( 1182 DR), when it was attacked and burned by infiltrators from below. The Moonmaiden's followers began worshiping at the House of the Moon (\$76) in the Year of Soft Fogs ( 1188 DR), where they have remained ever since, having foiled an arson attempt in the Year of the Saddle (1345 DR) on the "Night of Temple Fires."

Led by the charismatic Priestess of the High Moonlight Naneatha Suaril, the church of the Moonmaiden has waxed in strength since the Time of Troubles, when the church of Selûne foiled the dark plots of Shar and her followers. Naneatha lent strong backing to the effort to found the Order of the Blue Moon after the Time of Troubles, and High Moonknight Xale and other knights of the order are in regular attendance at the House of the Moon.  
'Current Base of Operations: House of the Moon (\$76) and Selune's Smile (D6).

Former Base of Operations: High House of Stars and the Plinth (T38).

Most members of the clergy are instructed in the Initiate of Selûne ${ }^{\mathrm{PG}}$ feat and select the Lunar Magic ${ }^{\circ}$ feat, once they qualify. Senior members of the order usually adopt the silverstar ${ }^{\mathrm{PP}}$ prestige class.

Naneatha Suaril: Priestess of the High Moonlight Naneatha (CG female Illuskan cleric 6/silverstar ${ }^{\text {PP }} 10 /$ divine disciple ${ }^{\text {PG }}$ 4 [Selûne]) is deliberate, proud, and more than a match for Waterdeep's haughtiest nobles. As the daughter of a minor Neverwintan noble family and the sister of Lady Wylynd Moonstar (see page 62), Naneatha has impeccable fashion sense and is known for her rich, bejeweled gowns of the finest make. Having never forgiven herself for falling victim to Shar's machinations during the Time of Troubles, Naneatha has crusaded against the Dark Lady's followers ever since.

### Order of the Blue Moon

Mystryl, the original goddess of magic, is said to have been born of Selûne. Although Mystryl's second successor Mystra (once the mortal wizard Midnight) retains dominion over the Weave, Selûne is thought by some to retain a measure of influence over her twice-removed daughter's portfolio, causing the Weave to ebb and flow much as the moon causes tides in Torilian bodies of water.

The Order of the Blue Moon is a small religious order dedicated to both the Mother of Mystryl and the reigning Lady of Mysteries. The group draws its name from fluctuations of the Weave that result in localized concentrations of magic that occur at varying locations during nights of the full moon, causing Selûne to appear blue in color. Members of this order serve both goddesses in their endless battles with Shar, the Mistress of the Night. They seek advantage over the dark servants of their eternal foe by making strategic use of Selûne's influence over the Weave combined with the power of the Weave itself.

The order gathers only to debate shared goals and propose new missions beneath the light of a blue moon. The order's hidden chapter house is said to lie amid the Red Rocks north of Waterdeep, protected by both the ever-raging waters of the sea and a permanent maelstrom of wild magic. However, Waterdeep's House of the Moon serves as the order's day-to-day center of operations, for Naneatha Suaril actively supports the order's

goals. Knights of the Blue Moon are most active along the Sword Coast and western Inner Sea lands.

Paladins who join this order are permitted to freely multiclass as sorcerers, as long as their sorcerer level never exceeds their paladin level. Note that only Mystra allows paladins in her service.

### Church of Shar

Although adherents of the Nightmaiden have long been active in the shadow of Mount Waterdeep, the Waterdhavian church of Shar traces its origins to a disastrous expedition to the Black Jungles in the Year of Dark Dawn (1104 DR) by Lord Vanrak Moonstar, a noted explorer in his day. Formerly a charismatic, outgoing swashbuckler, Vanrak returned a pale shadow of his former self. Within a tenday of his return, Lord Andvarran Moonstar, the family patriarch, died of a strange wasting disease unknown to Waterdeep's healers and strangely resistant to their spells.

Lord Vanrak assumed leadership of House Moonstar and publicly broke with the priests of the High House of Stars (see Vault of Stars, page 120), whom he blamed for his father's untimely death. Consumed with bitterness, the Dark Ranger, as he came to be known, secretly embraced Selûne's ancient enemy, the Lady of Loss.

By the Year of the Howling Moon (1130 DR), House Moonstar was in open schism. Those Moonstar nobles who still venerated Selûne aligned themselves with Lord Vanrak's sister, Lady Alathene, and took refuge in the temple of Selûne. At the Moonstar villa in Dock Ward (now the Blushing Mermaid festhall [D36]), Lord Vanrak and his followers-a small army of mercenaries and priests of Shar-extended their dark influence over much of the city's harbor.

On the night of the seventh full moon of the year, Lady Alathene asked the Lords of Waterdeep to strip her brother of his title and banish him from the city. To prove her case, she presented evidence of her brother's numerous crimes including slavery, arson, theft, and murder. The Lords ordered the Dark Ranger's immediate capture, but when the watch breached the gates of the Moonstar villa, Lord Vanrak and his followers had disappeared.

Unbeknownst to his moon-worshiping kin, Lord Vanrak had fled through a secret portal into Undermountain. For decades thereafter, the Dark Ranger and his followers explored Halaster's Halls. In the Year of the Dark Mask (1181 DR), Vanrak and his followers conquered a highly defensible redoubt in the Dark Levels of Undermountain (UM SLM). From this base, the church of Shar grew strong, exerting its influence throughout much of Undermountain and periodically dispatching assassins and marauders to battle followers of the Moonmaiden in the city above.

The church of Shar achieved its most dramatic success in the Year of the Tomb (1182 DR), when Vanrak's followers infiltrated the cellars of the High House of Stars and slaughtered most of the inhabitants. They also acquired enough treasure from the temple vaults to fund Lord Vanrak's personal quest for immortality. Within a few years, the Dark Ranger voluntarily transformed himself into a death knight ${ }^{\text {M386 }}$-the perfect, eternal servant of the Lady of Loss.

In recent years, Lord Vanrak's followers have failed to execute several important plans. In the Year of the Saddle (1345 DR), the Dark Army of the Night tried to set afire the House of the Moon ( $\$ 56$ ) as part of the "Night of Temple Fires." In the Year of Shadows ( 1358 DR), the avatar of Shar attempted to subvert the Moonmaiden's church by masquerading as her ancient foe and imprisoning the avatar of Selûne. Shar's faithful were driven from the city after followers of the Moonmaiden freed Selûne from Shar's clutches, forced to nurse their bitterness anew in the darkness of Vanrakdoom.

Special: The church of Shar requires members to be true adherents of the Lady of Loss, with a demonstrable understanding of the church's teachings ( 4 ranks in Knowledge [religion]).

The ranks of the priesthood are made up primarily of clerics, but all divine spellcasters are welcome. Most members of the clergy are instructed in the Initiate of Shar ${ }^{\mathrm{x}}$ feat, once they qualify. Senior members of the church usually adopt the nightcloak ${ }^{\mathrm{er}}$ prestige class.

Gathgaer Milomynt: Gathgaer. (NE male Chondathan human cleric 7 [Shar]) is a beak-nosed, alert-looking man with close-cropped brown hair and beady brown eyes. He favors dark robes and a handy mace at his belt. Gathgaer purports to be a medicinal healer, selling medicines and treatments out of a run-down house in Dock Ward (D68). In truth, he is a slaver, kidnapping folk of little influence or profile in Waterdeep and transporting them down into Undermountain's second level by a two-way keyed portal that leads from his iron maiden to a sarcophagus. Gathgaer sells the slaves to Hlethvagi Anteos (see page 42 ), who transports them down to Skullport.

### Church of Talos

The Storm Lord does not have a large following in Waterdeep, although many sailors in Dock Ward whisper prayers as a storm approaches while at sea. Nevertheless, itinerant Talosians visit the City of Splendors from time to time, leaving a trail of destruction in their waki.

Sumer of Calimport: Sumer (CE male Calishite human cleric 5/stormlord ${ }^{\mathrm{er}} 4$ [Talos]) is tall, slim, dusky-skinned and dark-haired, favoring purple robes and an excessive amount of silver jewelry. He has become rich trading goods between Calimport and Waterdeep, and he visits the City of Splendors two or three times per year for a tenday or so each visit. Sumer is never without his regular bodyguard (five Calishite human warrior 3) and his crony Greeme (CE male Calishite human fighter 5 /rogue 1 /assassin 2 ), who favors poisoned blades.

Although Sumer keeps a low profile and does not cause public trouble, he kills at least one person on each visit for the glory of Kozah (Talos), despite the efforts of his brother-in-law Olophin (a civilar in the City Guard) to frustrate him. Sumer usually targets adventurers, as they regularly disappear through their own foolishness and thus are unlikely to be missed. Sumer typically chooses a target after concluding his business, follows the target around the city until they are weak or resting, and then attacks. He will flee if is life is threatened, sacrificing his guards to make his escape.

### Church of Tymora

The City of Splendors has long been a beacon for adventurers who trust their lives to Lady Luck. The donations of those who braved the depths of Undermountain and survived to tell the tale alone were enough to construct the Tower of Luck (\$19) in just a few short years. Nevertheless, the church of Tymora continues to struggle, due in large part to the lack of adherents among the year-round citizenry. Some say that High Lady Priest Seenroas  
and Lord Prior Markos are too mercenary, trading in luck as if it were a commodity, while others say they are ignoring the burgeoning number of adherents among the halfling population of Waterdeep.

Base of Operations: The Tower of Luck (\$19).  
Church of Tymora (Standard Religious): AL CG, CN, N; 40,000. gp resource limit; Membership 192; Integrated (humans 71, halflings 38, elves 37, dwarves 19, gnomes 13, half-elves 10 , half-orcs 4 , others 2 ); dues 7 gp/month (none to join).

Requirements: You must adhere to the teachings of Tymora, and give a special offering of at least 50 gp value every time a stroke of great luck favors you (you roll a 20 on an attack roll or saving throw).

Favored in Guild Fringe Benefit: Once per character level you can call upon the powers of chance to intercede on your behalf immediately prior to a single d20 roll. You gain a bonus equal to $1 \mathrm{~d} 10-4$ on the roll; if the result is negative, you take the appropriate penalty instead (fate is fickle, after all).

Special: The church of Tymora requires members to be true adherents of Lady Luck, with a demonstrable understanding of the church's teachings ( 2 ranks in Knowledge [religion]).

The ranks of the priesthood are made up primarily of clerics, but all divine spellcasters are welcome. Senior members of the church sometimes adopt the auspician ${ }^{\mathrm{er}}$ prestige class.

Elegul Another: Elegul (male Tethyrian human cleric 7 [Tymora]) is a kind soul who aids those in need of healing and help. To avoid creating a dependence on Tymora's favor, he eschews joining adventuring bands and instead wanders, dispensing the beneficence of Lady Luck. Since his recent escape from Undermountain, he has confined his ministries to the city proper and its immediate aboveground environs.

Lamris Kholl: Lamris (CG female human cleric 5 [Tymora]) is a strikingly beautiful woman from Llorkh with a vivacious and unpredictable nature. Although loyal and true to her calling, she can be rather irresponsible and capricious. She recently managed to rescue her family from Zhent-controlled Llorkh thanks to the unasked-for aid of Adama, and now, after years of toying with his emotions, is beginning to view him in a much more positive light.

Adama Miiralin: Adama (CG male Chondathan human cleric 5 [Tymora]) is a naïve, kindly young priest from Arabel with aspirations of rising up in a temple hierarchy far from the heresies of his native church. He is a nightly regular at the Yawning Portal (C48), attending to adventurers entering or exiting Undermountain and keeping a record of who dares the ultimate test of Lady Luck. Despite his normally wise demeanor, Adama trusts in luck implicitly, taking wild risks as a matter of course.

### Church of TYr

Waterdeep has long been a bastion of justice and the rule of law in the North (or at least has aspired to be such), thanks in large part to the followers of Tyr who have long played an illustrious role in the governance of the City of Splendors. As such, the church of Tyr and its associated religious orders hold a prominent role in the city's religious and political life, but conflicts between the twin obligations of faith and public service have created discord and division among the faithful.

The four primary factions within the Waterdeep arm of the church include members of the government, the formal cleric hierarchy, the Holy Order of the Knights of Samular, and the Order of the Even-Handed. Members of the government include Piergeiron the Paladinson (see page 53), Madeiron Sunderstone (see page 34), Mulgor of Tyr (see page 35), Rulathon (see page 36), and Texter (see page 55). Few last long in such positions if their primary obedience is not to god and government first. For example, Piergeiron would not last long as Open Lord if it became apparent that he put the dictates of the cleric hierarchy above the best interests of Waterdeep. In contrast, members of the cleric faction owe their primary allegiance to god and church hierarchy, while members of the religious orders owe their primary allegiance to god and brotherhood.

### Clergy of Tyr

The clergy of Tyr are considered by the followers of Grimjaws to be the church of Tyr, encompassing the independents, the Order of the Even-Handed, and the Holy Order of the Knights of Samular. In practice, however, the clergy encompasses only those who are not members of the other three factions.

Base of Operations: Halls of Justice (C5).  
Clergy of the Church of Tyr (Expansive Religious): AL LG; 100,000 gp resource limit; Membership 217; Isolated (humans 199, half-elves 9 , shield dwarves 6 , others 3 ); Dues $10 \mathrm{gp} /$ month.

Authority Figures: Hammer Lord Hykros Allumen (see below); Tyr's Champion Harkas Kormallis (see page 48).

Important Characters: Lorkas Ermaxis (LG human Tethyrian male cleric 14 [Tyr]); Jhassalan "of the Lightning" (see below).

Associated Classes: Barbarian, cleric, fighter, monk, paladin, ranger, wizard.

Associated Skills: Concentration, Diplomacy, Heal, Knowledge (nobility and royalty), Knowledge (religion), Spellcraft.

Requirements: You must adhere to the tenets of Tyr's faith and spend at least 20 hours a tenday engaged in charitable work among the city's poor or in attendance in the city's temple, assisting petitioners.

Favored in Guild Fringe Benefit: Tyr's teachings have helped you to differentiate truth from falsehood in the pursuit of justice. Once per character level you can call upon your teachings to gain a +5 bonus on any one Sense Motive check.

Special: The church of Tyr requires members to be true adherents of the Maimed God, with a demonstrable understanding of the church's teachings ( 4 ranks in Knowledge [religion]).

The ranks of the priesthood are made up primarily of clerics and paladins, but all divine spellcasters are welcome. Most members of the order are instructed in the Initiate of $\mathrm{Tyr}^{\mathrm{PO}}$ feat, once they qualify. Rare members of the church are sufficiently zealous to take the Hand of $\mathrm{Tyr}^{+}$feat. Senior members of the order sometimes adopt the justiciar of $\mathrm{Tyr}^{\mathrm{PO}}$ prestige class.

Hykros Allumen: Hammer Lord Hykros (LG male Illuskan paladin 20) is the high priest of the Halls of Justice (C5) and the leader of the clergy of Tyr in Waterdeep. Hykros is a devout worshiper of the Maimed God and a strong pillar in the defense of the rule of law in Waterdeep. He is also a student of the church's early traditions, believing that the followers of Tyr have gradually fallen away from the truths revealed when Tyr first marched across Faerûn in the Procession of Justice.

As a result of his traditional and orthodox beliefs, Hykros rejects many aspects of the modern church. In particular, he firmly rejects the notion that Tyr is the latest incarnation of Anachtyr, a belief held by most southern sects of the church, and his prejudice in this regards extends to most non-Northerners. In addition, he regards Tyrran cleric, monk, and paladin traditions as distinct and separate, and he looks with distaste upon those who attempt to fuse these clearly defined roles.

Jhassalan "of the Lightning": Jhassalan (LG male Illuskan human evoker 7/arcane devotee ${ }^{\mathrm{PG}} 1$ [Tyr]) is a native of Silverymoon whose title stems from his penchant for electricity spells and the lightning-shaped shock of blond hair that runs from his temple and over his brown-haired scalp. Jhassalan was a member of the ill-fated Guild of the Just, an adventuring band of Tyrrans who attacked the House of Pain in Undermountain to free a bunch of captives but was then ambushed by the forces of Loviatar. Jhassalan escaped only due to the unlooked-for aid of Muiral the Misshapen. In the years since that failure, Jhassalan has rededicated himself to the service of Tyr, and now leads the small contingent of arcane spellcasters who serve in the Halls of Justice (C5). He retains his deep loathing for the Church of Loviatar and continues to investigate from where it is receiving its funds.

### Holy Order of the Knights of Samular

In the Year of the Rings Royal ( 952 DR), the Second Troll War finally ended under the leadership of Aeroth, War Captain of Silverymoon. One of the great heroes of that war was Samular Caradoon, a Tyrran knight whose bravery and faith were unsurpassed. Samular was the third of three brothers. The oldest, Renwick, studied wizardry, while Amphail the Just and his younger brother Samular became paladins of Tyr.

Nearly two decades before the war, Renwick Caradoon acquired a trio of artifacts of mysterious purpose now known as the rings of Samular and later gave them to Samular to hold. When the Second Troll War began, the magic of the three rings enabled the brothers (each of whom temporarily held one of the rings) to employ a magic siege engine known as Kezefbane to great effect against the trolls, lifting the siege of Waterdeep. For his heroism and leadership, Amphail was elevated to the position of War Lord of Waterdeep after the battle, only to die in a troll raid less than a year later. Without the third brother, the effectiveness of Kezefbane against the

---

trolls was greatly diminished. Nevertheless, Samular played a key role in Aeroth's eventual victory through his martial prowess and valor; in so doing, Samular acquired a legion of devoted followers. Renwick fell in the final battle, but the eldest brother had prepared to transform into an archlich, a process he began as he lay dying. Only Samular knew that Renwick had survived his "death" in battle.

After the war, Samular formed an order of Tyrran paladins based in the North. Under Samular's leadership, the order seized Thornhold, the keep of a petty warlord named Brunyundar Margaster, and made Thornhold its chapterhouse. Located just south of the Mere of Dead Men, Thornhold became the personal property of Samular and his direct heirs. Renwick retreated into his tower in the Sumber Hills-his undead state would have been considered an abomination by many of Samular's followers-and Samular's acceptance of such would have destroyed the fledgling order. Samular ordered that a training monastery, Summit Hall, be built around Renwick's tower, and that the tower remain undisturbed for all time, in honor of his brother's memory. The heart of the order moved to Waterdeep, occupying a wing of the Halls of Justice (C5).

Current Base of Operations: Summit Hall (Sumber Hills, southeast of Red Larch), Halls of Justice (C5).

Former Base of Operations: Thornhold (just south of the Mere of Dead Men on the Long Road, now held by Bronwyn Caradoon and shield dwarves of Clan Stoneshaft).

Holy Order of the Knights of Samular (Expansive Religious): AL LG; 40,000 gp resource limit; Membership 508; Isolated (humans 474, half-elves 15 , aasimar 13 , others 6 ); Dues 50 $\mathrm{gp} /$ month ( 500 gp to join).

Authority Figures: Sir Gareth Cormaeril of Waterdeep (see below); Master Laharin Goldbeard of Summit Hall (LG male Illuskan human paladin 20 [Tyr]); High Lord Abbot Mantasso of Summit Hall (LG male Tethyrian humán cleric 13/divine champion ${ }^{20} 5$ [Tyr]).

Important Characters: Bronwyn Caradoon (not a member, see Rogues and Ruffians); Morus Brokengulf II (see below); Renwick "Snowcloak" Caradoon (not a member, see below); Harkas Kormallis (see below).

Associated Classes: Aristocrat, cleric, fighter, paladin.  
Associated Skills: Concentration, Diplomacy, Heal, Knowledge (religion), Ride, Sense Motive.

Requirements: You must uphold the tenets of Tyr's faith and obey the lawful commands of superiors in the Order. You must also serve an average of 10 hours per tenday standing guard over places holy to Tyr or the strongholds of the Order.

Favored in Guild Fringe Benefit: Your faith is bolstered by your participation in the Order. Once per character level, you can deem a particularly insidious mind-affecting spell or ability to be a test of faith, and thereby gain a +5 bonus on your Will saving throw against that attack.

Special: Admittance to the Knights of Samular is open only to males of human descent and usually requires the successful completion of a quest and a vow of devotion to the Maimed God. The aspirant must demonstrate knowledge of the tenets of Tyr's faith ( 2 ranks in Knowledge [religion]).

Senior members of the order usually adopt the justiciar of Tyr ${ }^{20}$ prestige class.

Algorind: Algorind (LG male Tethyrian paladin 6) has strong features, short, fair, curly hair, and a guileless, direct blue-eyed gaze. He favors chainmail covered by a white tabard bearing the symbol of Tyr and rides a white stallion named Icewind. Where once he was an earnest young man, full of certainty and strong in faith, Algorind is now a man adrift. Although he is earnest, dedicated, and sincere, his willingness to follow the orders of his superiors unquestioningly has led him far from Tyr's principles, much to his confusion. As a result, Algorind relies on Sir Gareth Cormaeril (see below) for advice and direction even more than he did in years past, unaware that it was Sir Gareth's manipulation that has sent him on one lonely, futile quest after another for the past few years. Algorind has only recently returned to Waterdeep, determined once again to prove his worth to his beloved order. He has orders to avoid Bronwyn Caradoon (see page 74), since the two worked to opposite ends in the Thornhold affair.

Harkas Kormallis: Harkas (LG male Illuskan human paladin 8/justiciar of $\mathrm{Tyr}^{20} 6$ [Tyr], Hand of $\mathrm{Tyr}^{4}$ feat) is the eldest son of Lord Helm Kormallis. He is also Tyr's Champion, tasked with the defense of the Halls of Justice (C5). Of the two roles, Harkas takes only the second seriously, because he is fanatically devoted to the service of the Maimed God, going so far as to cut off his right hand to demonstrate his faith. Harkas is the senior paladin of the Knights of Samular based in Waterdeep, and he strictly governs the conduct of members of the order. Harkas is a strong believer in the importance of regular quests, and he regularly calls upon younger Knights of Samular to handle reports of evil doings in the wilds of the North.

Among the Knights, Harkas is closest with Lord Morus Brokengulf II, whom he regards as a son and protégé. Harkas has somewhat strained relations with Hykros Allumen, believing that the Hammer Lord's prejudices blind him to the greater glory of Tyr. Of course, Harkas himself has failed to notice the seed of evil now staining the order, embodied in his right-hand man, Sir Gareth Cormaeril.

Morus Brokengulf II: By the age of 16, Lord Morus (LG male Illuskan human paladin 4, Hand of Tyr ${ }^{4}$ feat) was a paladin and Tyrran zealot, cutting off his own right hand in sacrifice to Tyr and devoting himself to the teachings of Harkas Kormallis. After roaming the Sword Coast for years, doing good in Tyr's name, the death of the elder Lord Morus I forced Morus II to return to Waterdeep and assume the mantle of patriarch. After several months of frustration, the new Lord Morus II turned over day-to-day operation of the family business to his close friend, Sir Gareth Cormaeril, Exchequer of the Knights of Samular, so that he could once again sally forth against the evils of the North in the name of Tyr. Lord Morus II returns to Waterdeep periodically, but now spends most of his time away, battling evil monsters and hunting Old Gnawbones, a long-standing enemy of the family.

Renwick "Snowcloak" Caradoon: Renwick (LN male archlich [augmented Illuskan human] wizard 14/arcane devotee ${ }^{20} 5$ [Tyr]) is the elder brother of Amphail the Just and the legendary Samular. Centuries ago, he engineered the founding of the Holy Order of Samular and then retreated into undeath and seclusion.

---

The Guardian of the Order has hidden for centuries in his old tower in Summit Hall, awaiting a descendant of Samular to claim the third of the rings of Samular. Although Bronwyn Caradoon (see page 74) briefly united the rings and Kezefbane, Renwick's long-laid plans are blocked once again by her decision to divide the rings among the Knights of Samular, the church of Cyric, and the Harpers, and to hide Kezefbane away again in a location unknown to Renwick (in Blackstaff Tower).

Gareth Cormaeril: Sir Gareth (CE male Chondathan human paladin 7/blackguard 9, Veil of Cyric ${ }^{4}$ feat) is a tall, wellmade man in vigorous late life distantly related to the now exiled Cormyrian noble house of the same name. He wears his white hair in precise waves and has bright blue eyes. Although he retired from active service in the Knights of Samular over three decades ago, thanks to a grievous wound that left him with a withered right arm, Sir Gareth has continued to serve the order for many years as Exchequer of the Knights and the senior paladin of the order based in Waterdeep at the Halls of Justice (C9).

Unbeknownst to his fellow knights, or indeed anyone other than Malchior and Dag Zoreth of Darkhold, Sir Gareth fell away from the faith of Tyr decades ago after saving the life of Hronrulf Caradoon at the cost of his arm. It was Gareth who sold the location of Hronrulf's children to the Zhentarim in the Year of the Spur ( 1348 DR), and it was Gareth who nearly engineered the assemblage of the rings of Samular and Kezefbane in the hands of Dag Zoreth, a priest of Cyric.

Sir Gareth has never admitted even to himself that he no longer follows the teachings of Tyr, constructing elaborate rationalizations and falling back on willful ignorance to justify his actions to himself and others. Nevertheless, he continues to follow the lead of Malchior of Darkhold and fund his activities, claiming to Dag Zoreth, for example, that "Whatever else he might be, Malchior's a scholar and most knowledgeable in the lore and history of the order. Therefore, it is right and fitting that some of the order's monies support his work. I have no firsthand knowledge that these funds were used in any other manner." The fallen paladin never explicitly lies, but often omits inconvenient truths or misleads others.

### Order of the Even-Handed

The Order of the Even-Handed is a local monastic order dedicated to Tyr. The order's small chapterhouse sits on the slopes of Mount Waterdeep, overlooking Smuggler's Bay. Due to longstanding philosophical differences between Grand Master Hlam and Hammer Lord Hykros Allumen (Hykros believes Hlam's mixing of cleric and monk traditions to be heresy), the order has closer ties with the Hall of Justice in Neverwinter than it does with the clergy of Waterdeep's Tyrran temple, going so far as to send its tithes to the City of Skilled Hands.

Hlam, Grand Master of the Even-Handed, has long dwelled in a small cave partway up the eastern slopes of Mount Waterdeep. Over the years, as he trained a succession of younger monks who found their way to his cave, Hlam developed a monastic discipline that he called the Way of the Sacred Fists, giving equal weight to cleric magic and monk training. In recent years, his students organized themselves into a monastic order, one that taught both individual self-reliance and a duty to bring justice to the world. With the assistance of Piergeiron, Hlam's disciples purchased an aging manor near their master's cave to serve as the order's chapter house.

Although Hlam has always preferred to adventure alone, most of the younger members of the order seek out companies of fair-minded adventurers of varied skills, as opposed to journeying with other members of the order. However, it is a goal for every member of the order to have one grand solo adventure in the service of the Grimjaws before they die. Most also seek to battle and defeat a Helmite monk in ritual combat.

Base of Operations: House of Two Hands (C74).  
Order of the Even-Handed (Minor Religious): AL LG, LN; 3,000 gp resource limit; Membership 32; Mixed (humans 20, elves 3, half-elves 3, halflings 2, gnomes 2, dwarves 1, half-orcs 1); Dues $1 \mathrm{gp} /$ month (none to join).

Authority Figure: Grand Master Hlam (see below). Important Characters: Master of the Left Hand Otho Delcourt (LN male Illuskan human monk 4/cleric 2/sacred fist ${ }^{\mathrm{CD}} 1$ [Tyr]); Master of the Right Hand Ella Fornyth (LG female half-moon elf cleric 4/monk 2/sacred fist ${ }^{\mathrm{CD}} 1$ [Tyr]).

Associated Classes: Cleric, fighter, monk.

Associated Skills: Concentration, Diplomacy, Heal, Knowledge (religion), Move Silently, Sense Motive.

Requirements: You must adhere to the tenets of Tyr's faith.

Favored in Guild Fringe Benefit: Your resolve in the service of Tyr the Just gives you a special blessing. Once per character level, you can call on your blessing to add a +3 bonus to the save DC of one stunning attack you make using the Stunning Fist feat or cleric spell you cast, provided the target of your attack or spell is evil. If you are a monk, you can freely multiclass as a cleric or sacred fist and still advance as a monk.

Special: Admittance to the Order of the Even-Handed usually requires a vow of impartiality and a vow of devotion to Tyr the Even-Handed. Aspirants must demonstrate skill, in unarmed combat (Improved Unarmed Strike feat).

Most members of the order are instructed in the Combat Casting feat, once they qualify. Senior members of the order usually adopt the sacred fist ${ }^{\mathrm{CD}}$ prestige class.

Hlam: Hlam (LG male Tethyrian human monk 7/cleric 1/sacred fist ${ }^{\mathrm{CD}} 6$ [Tyr]) is a humble man who fled Tethyr during

---

the Ten Black Days and found his calling as a monk in the service of Tyr in the wilds of the Savage Frontier. He is of slight build and middling height, but he is incredibly fit. Hlam keeps his head and face completely shaved, favoring simple tunics and a ritual blindfold of thin white gauze. The Grand Master has little involvement in the order he nominally leads, but he looks with great favor on the efforts of his student to extend his teachings, seeing it as the will of Tyr.

### Church of Umberlee

Although the Bitch Queen is given more than her due in the City of Splendors during the annual donations to Umberlee's Cache (see page 120), the church of Umberlee has never been strong in the City of Splendors. The Bitch Queen's official emissary to Waterdeep is usually a priest based in Stormhaven House on Orlumbor, charged with overseeing the Fleetswake ceremonies and observing which ships pay proper homage to the Bitch Queen upon departing Deepwater Harbor.

In the Year of the Gauntlet (1369 DR), Dread High Trident Meritid Archneie discovered a magic abalone shell floating in the harbor, which he believed to be the legendary Org/ara, a sacred text of the Bitch Queen. Seeing this as a good omen, Meritid promptly petitioned the Lords to use half the annual tithe to construct a temple to the Bitch Queen atop a large outcropping of rock near the end of the large sandbar that extends south of the city's South Gate. Without explanation, the Lords agreed to his unlikely request, and construction was begun on the azurehued Queenspire (HY). Now, after many years of work, the Queenspire is finally nearing completion, and Meritid has sent out a call far and wide for Umberlants to join him in worshiping the Queenspire in the lee of Mount Waterdeep.

Base of Operations: The Queenspire (HY).  
Church of Umberlee (Minor Religious): AL CE; 15,000 gp resource limit; Membership 24; Isolated (humans 18, merfolk 4, weresharks ${ }^{\text {MF }} 2$ ); Dues $20 \mathrm{gp} /$ month (none to join).

Authority Figure: Dread High Trident Meritid Archneie (CE male Tethyrian human cleric 15 [Umberlee]).  
'Associated Classes: Adept, cleric, druid, fighter, ranger, rogue.

Associated Skills: Concentration, Intimidate, Knowledge (religion), Profession (sailor), Spellcraft, Swim.

Requirements: You must uphold the tenets of Umberlee's faith and spend an average of 10 hours per tenday ensuring that ships leaving harbor placate Umberlee before they set out.

Favored in Guild Fringe Benefit: Umberlee rewards your faith and service by stretching forth her hand to smite your enemies. Once per character level, you can call on her power to gain a +5 profane bonus on a single attack roll or spell penetration check.

Special: The church of Umberlee requires members to be true adherents of the Bitch Queen with a demonstrable understanding of the church's teachings ( 4 ranks in Knowledge [religion]).

The ranks of the priesthood are made up primarily of clerics, but all divine spellcasters are welcome.

Senior members of the church sometimes take up the waveservant ${ }^{\text {FF }}$ prestige class.

### Rences and Smugglers

Although the assassin, drug, poison, and slave trades of Waterdeep are largely confined to Skullport, the City of Splendors is home to a fair share of illegal commerce. There is a large resale market for purloined goods, many of which are stolen in one ward, sold in another, and then displayed prominently by their new owners in a third. Some of the known fences and dealers in contraband of Waterdeep are described below.

Balthorr "the Bold" Olaskos: Balthorr (N male Tethyrian rogue 8) is a hearty, loud-voiced, bubbling fellow with a ready smile and firm handshake. He is an expert on the currency, uniforms, and badges used by most realms of Faerûn, and he can make up colorful stories about the history of particular items on the spot. He owns Balthorr's Rare and Wondrous Treasures (C14) offering a wide selection of curios. Balthorr's apparent honesty is belied by his willingness to purchase coins, gems, and regalia with no questions asked, although if he suspects an item is "hot" he offers only $40 \%$ of market value. Balthorr has long been a spy for the Shadow. Thieves, and, now that the guild has returned to Waterdeep, he has grown increasingly involved in their affairs.

Ildar "the Duke of Darkness" Orsabbas: Orsabbas (CE male Tethyrian expert 5) is stout, fun loving, and slightly pompous. He is the owner of Orsabbas's Fine Imports (T17), a shop stocked with odd items from far across Faerûn. Known as "the Duke of Darkness" for the masked, sinister guise he wears during nobles' feasts, he enjoys making threats, dancing, and seduction while in costume. Ildar goes to such feasts in part to examine the tapestries, wines, and perfumes, for he specializes in fencing such items, paying $30 \%$ of the value. Ildar buys such items with no questions asked, earning him the nickname "the Fingers," but his price always drops dramatically if he recognizes the item as stolen or "hot."

Orlpar Husteem: Orlpar (CE male Chondathan aristocrat 1/rogue 6) is the bored, thrill-seeking, cunning younger brother of Lord Orbos. From his house (N59) on Golden Serpent Street, Orlpar deals in spices, scents, wines, and drugs, purchasing goods at $50 \%$ of their market value, and selling them at a tidy profit to jaded young scions of the nobility. He occasionally deals in large and unique thefts that have the town buzzing. Orlpar can be reached through his employee, a ne'er-do-well hanger-on named Hala Myrt (NE female Tethyrian commoner 1) who frequents the Grinning Lion (N56). She arranges meetings with Orlpar at the Grinning Lion and then delivers the goods herself at a later time (when Orlpar has a convenient alibi).

Orlpar has long had an arms-length relationship with the Xanathar Thieves Guild. In recent years, however, that relationship has grown much closer, allowing Orlpar to corner the market on haunspeir, mordayn powder, and tekkil with the guild's quiet backing. (All three of these substances are detailed in Lords of Darkness.) Orlpar's vaults are guarded by a death tyrant and the wizard Helmyn Fausspiel (CN male Illuskan wizard 9), whom Orlpar keeps well supplied with haunspeir and mordayn powder.

---

Orlpar's cellars link to the city's sewers and, in recent years have become something of a safe house for the Xanathar Thieves Guild (see Agents of the Eye, page 64).

Phalantar Orivan: Phalantar (NE male Chondathan human rogue 7, Snake Blood ${ }^{\text {PG }}$ feat) is a native of far-off Hlondeth, with dark olive skin, a shaved head, a manicured black beard, and a gentle smile. The owner of Phalantar's Philtres \& Components (C33) always smiles gently and moves smoothly and quietly. He sells exotic medicines, spices, herbs, and rare substances used in the making of perfumes, scented oils, poisons, and spell components. Phalantar deals with adventurers and arcane spellcasters regularly and is fabulously rich. He buys magic items, no questions asked, at $40 \%$ of the market value. Finally, Phalantar sponsors adventuring bands in return for a share of their loot (substances he can sell in his shop) and bankrolls some Sword Coast mercenary companies in exchange for a share of their profit and plunder.

### Guilds and Merchants

Economic activity in Waterdeep has been dominated by the city's guilds for more than one hundred years. Their management and skilled control of commerce has brought Waterdeep to its current prominence as the premier center for trade on the Sword Coast. Although their avarice, ruthlessness, and greed have nearly destroyed Waterdeep twice in the past, the guilds have also brought the city great prosperity. The Lords must recognize all guilds, and applications for guild formation are rarely granted. No new guild can overlap the provenance of an existing guild because the Lords prefer that competition exist within guilds rather than between them.

Guilds have widely varying degrees of influence, but no official precedence. The guilds are rarely if ever united. They constantly ally with and strive against rival guilds, prominent noble houses, established trading costers, and the Lords themselves. Some guilds work closely with the Lords, providing essential city services, while others are specialty guilds that wield influence only in the Market.

All guilds have a guildhall, which acts as a headquarters, showcase, meeting place, central clearinghouse for guild business, offices of the guild officers, and (sometimes) place of business. Within a guild, individual ranks vary, but usually they include the following: Master, Elders, or Council; "senior members"; and Apprentice or Prentice or Novice. Guild law, the rules under which specific trades are conducted, are distinct from city law, but they can never conflict with or override city law or the intent of such laws. Guilds can never restrict all trade to themselves; the Lords are adamant in enforcing the right of merchants and tradesfolk to operate outside the strictures of the guilds if they prefer. Obviously, guilds cannot be held accountable for such persons, and tradesfolk operating outside the guilds are not entitled to guild rights and privileges.

The current roster of Waterdhavian guilds (and guildhalls) includes the following establishments.

Baker's Guild (C27)  
Carpenters', Roofers', \& Plaisterers' Guild (S2)  
Cellarers' \& Plumbers' Guild (T26)

Wagonmakers' \& Coach Builders' Guild (S5)  
Watchful Order of Magists \& Protectors (C15)

### Guild Masters

Some of the city's most notable guildmasters include the following individuals.

Maxeene Rhiosann: Maxeene (NG human Tethyrian human expert 12), Lady Voice of the Council of Musicians, Instrument-Makers, \& Choristers, is a large woman given to voluminous robes and dazzling, upswept sculptures of hair. Her voice is thought to give praise to Milil with every note, and she is legendary across the city for the hours-long performances she gives at intimate gatherings of cultured nobles. Since the death of Kriios Halamabar in the middle of his eleventh term of office, Maxeene has served as the Council's interim Master Musician and will continue to do so until the next election in the Year of the Haunting (1377 DR). Because Maxeene has publicly stated that she has no desire to hold that office, there is now widespread jockeying

---

among the leading musicians of the city for position, leading to barely submerged tensions within the Council and within the leadership of New Olamn.

Hilithiimm Turnstone: Hilithiimm (CG male Tethyrian human expert 14), the Master Plumber of the Cellarers' \& Plumbers' Guild and owner of Turnstone Plumbing and Pipefitting (D2), is a middle-aged, balding man with ample girth and a ready laugh who has the trust of the Lords, the watch, and the nobility. He has led the guild responsible for digging building foundations and keeping  
the sewers of the city functional and safe for many years, a job he hopes to one day turn over to his son, Jhalossan Turnstone (LG male Tethyrian human expert 9). The Turnstones are legendary for their discretion, for in the course of their duties they have learned many secrets of the city that the Lords and powerful merchant families do not want revealed. Unbeknownst to anyone, including his son, Hilithiimm is now the enslaved thrall of Nexil'Vendylig, one of the Savants of the Dark Tide (see page 57), whom he visits regularly to have his enslavement renewed. The aboleth allows Hilithimm to act as he would normally with the notable exception of steering away contingents of Cellarers from the aboleth-ruled portions of the sewers.

Rhazbos Redbridle: Rhazbos (CG male Illuskan human fighter 6/expert 3), a former mercenary and experienced caravan master, is now a stout, jolly man of advancing years, too busy (and fat) to take to the road on adventures any more. He makes his living breeding and training horses in Waterdeep, and he is now a ranking member of the Stablemasters' \&.Farriers' Guild. He also owns and operates a large and successful stable (S4). Rhazbos was once an adventurer, and he might take up to two tendays (at the most) off to tutor fighters if they offer him enough monetary incentive, including meals, and have a place (for example, a comfortable private house) where he can stay.

## Lords of Waterdeep

The Lords of Waterdeep have ruled the city for most of the last three centuries. During that period, there have been between fifty and eighty Lords of Waterdeep, of whom four reigned as Open Lord: Ahghairon the Mage, Baeron Silmaeril, Lhestyn the Masked Lady, and Piergeiron the Paladinson. The Lords of Waterdeep have been drawn from all walks of life, from noble to dungsweeper, and from merchant to cleric. Although most of the Lords of Waterdeep  
![img-11.jpeg](assets/City%20of%20Splendors,%20Waterdeep_img-11.jpeg)

Hilithiimm Turnstone visits his master  
have been human, they have included elves, halfelves, and halflings among their number.  
Of all the Lords selected by Ahghairon or his successors, only one, Kerrigan the Arcanist, has abused his position. Kerrigan, through various subterfuges and hired agents, killed three of his fellow Lords before Ahghairon discovered his treason. The resultant spell battle crossed the city before ending in Temple (now Southern) Ward with the death of the traitorous Lord.

The penalty for impersonating a Lord is immediate execution. On those occasions when a Lord appears to be about in the city in full regalia, officers of the guard or watch alert Piergeiron at once, for the Open Lord can demand that any Lord unmask himself or herself at his command. Failure to do so is also punishable by death. It is not uncommon for those

---

seeking to improve their standing, socially or economically, to claim to be a Lord. This is a dangerous practice, however, for if the perpetrator is caught in the lie, such claims are also punishable by death.

The Open Lord of Waterdeep, currently Piergeiron the Paladinson, holds the titles of Warden of Waterdeep (commander of the guard), Overmaster of the Guilds, and Commander of the Watch. He or she is the only Lord whose face is exposed and known to the public, and he serves as the city's chief diplomat. Although no other Lord is ever formally named, some individuals become the subject of widespread rumor or general consensus. Mirt the Moneylender, Larissa, and Texter are generally mentioned as prospects, and, until his apparent resignation, Khelben was generally agreed to be a Lord. (In truth, Khelben remains a Lord, although his resignation was genuine, if brief.)

Many of the Lords of Waterdeep are detailed below. The rest are left to the DM to develop as befits his or her campaign.

Piergeiron the Paladinson: Open Lord Piergeiron (LG male Tethyrian human paladin 17 [Tyr]) is a tall, muscular, handsome man of quiet confidence, poise, and patience. His hair is only slightly graying at the temples, despite his increasing years. The Paladinson speaks so seldom and slowly that he has acquired the nickname (never to his face) of "the Thickskull." Piergeiron is not stupid, but often pretends to be, so draw others out into admissions they might not make otherwise. The Paladinson is the son of Athar, "the Shining Knight," who was famed for slaying the great wyrm Kistarianth the Red.

Despite the many challenges of his tenure, Piergeiron has remained above reproach, ably administering the city and ensuring the rule of law. As such, the Paladinson is very safe from those who wish the city to flourish and a frequent target of attack by those who wish Waterdeep ill. Piergeiron dwells in the Palace of Waterdeep (C75), commonly known as Piergeiron's Palace, ever shadowed by his personal bodyguard, Madeiron Sunderstone (see page 34).

Piergeiron's wife Maethiira died in the Year of the Moonfall (1344 DR), and the couple had only one child. Aleena Paladinstar (LG female Tethyrian wizard 7/arcane devotee ${ }^{\mathrm{PG}} 4$ [Tyr]) has been absent from the city for several years, having taken to planewalking to see new worlds. Some say she might someday succeed her father when his reign as Open Lord comes to an end.

Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun the Elder: Khelben (LN male human [Chosen of Mystra] wizard 24/archmage 3) is fully detailed on page 274 of the Forgotten ReAlms Campaign Setting, updated in Epic Level Handbook (page 299). Khelben dwells in Blackstaff Tower (C6).

Kyriani Agrivar: Kyriani Agrivar (N female half-drow ${ }^{\text {Rac }}$ wizard 11/Moonstar agent 3) is a recent addition to the Lords of Waterdeep. For details about her, see page 87.

Brian the Swordmaster: Brian (NG male Illuskan human fighter 4/expert 16) is a gray-eyed bald man, with a black beard streaked with gray and a penchant for scowling. His years at the forge and as an armar of the guard have left him with a powerful build. Brian is a skilled swordsmith, the best in the city, and a master armorer. He crafts items of lasting beauty, durability, and exquisite workmanship. Much like "Kitten," he is known for his simple, direct way of looking at things. He is  
![img-12.jpeg](assets/City%20of%20Splendors,%20Waterdeep_img-12.jpeg)

The Lords of Waterdeep bold court

---

similar in outlook to Mirt, Durnan and Nindil, capable of seeing weak points in plans and foreseeing problems long before they occur. Brian dwells above his smithy (S7).

Brianne Byndraeth: Brianne (CG female Chondathan human sorcerer 12) is the widow of Carril Byndraeth, a crime lord and former Lord of Waterdeep murdered nearly two decades ago by a black wyrm in human form seeking the return of its eye. Brianne herself is a Lord of Waterdeep, and the rift between Brianne and Carril, before his death, nearly split the Lords into two factions. After Carril's death, Brianne played the role of respectable Waterdhavian widow, courted by a long string of men seeking to marry into wealth (and secretly of interest to the Lords). Now, after many years of looking, Brianne has finally been engaged to Randulaith of Mirabar (see page 65 ), a charming wizard who moves easily among the city's social elite. Brianne has a tower (N75) within the city proper but also lives in Carril's old estate outside the city.

Caladorn Cassalanter: Caladorn (NG male Tethyrian human fighter 13) stands six feet tall, with short brown hair, a cleanshaven face, and a prominent cleft in his chin. This young gallant is often sardonic, very perceptive, and intelligent. He is quite fun loving when he can find an occasion to abandon his customary serious resolve in private. He is the third son of Lord Ohrl Cassalanter, but has chosen to drop the family name "until he does something worthy of it." His father has come to suspect that Caladorn will never consider himself "worthy," leaving him the privileges of the nobility without having to answer to the family patriarch. The Cassalanters are unaware that their restless scion is actually a Lord of Waterdeep. In recent years, Caladorn has taken an increasing interest in Waterdeep's navy, posing as a bored young noble who could lend an extra swordarm to a raker on patrol. This has left him uniquely positioned among the Lords to understand the challenges Waterdeep faces in maintaining its hegemony on the Sea of Swords. Caladorn lives in a row house in Castle Ward (C71).

Durnan "the Wanderer": Durnan (NG male Illuskan fighter 18) is a gruff, burly, russet-haired man, close-mouthed and prudent. He hates unfairness and injustice, but is tolerant of the differing interests of others-at least until they unshéathe a weapon in his inn, whereupon he draws his longsword on the spot.

Durnan is a retired fighter born in the remote North who spent his youth wandering the Savage Frontier, battling monsters and their ilk. He is an old friend of Mirt the Moneylender, and the duo were the first in modern times to explore Undermountain, emerging in the Year of the Broken Helm (1302 DR) as rich men. While Mirt used share of their plunder to purchase his mansion on the southern slopes of Mount Waterdeep, Durnan built an inn, the Yawning Portal (C48) over the ruins of Halaster's long-vanished tower and now dwells there with his wife, Mhaere Dryndilstann (see page 40), and their daughter. As overseer of the primary open route into Undermountain, secret Lord of Waterdeep, and secret leader of the Red Sashes (see page 74), Durnan finds himself involved in most events of import to affect the City of Splendors, a role for which he is well suited.

Nindil Jalbuck: Nindil (LN male lightfoot halfling rogue 6/expert 4) stands some three feet high, sporting a distinctive jet-black crewcut and golden nose ring. His common clothing and grocer's apron do little to disguise the knowing look of a joker and mischief-maker in his sea-green eyes. Outside the city, he dons a suit of chainmail emblazoned with the emblem of Goldenfields. At his core, Nindil is loyal, good-natured, and trustworthy. He is slow to anger, only losing his temper when "talked down to."

Nindil hales from Secomber, having come to Waterdeep to make his fortune and survived through petty thievery and pickpocketing. In time, he found work as a spy and broker of underworld information. In time, Nindil turned aside from such work and established the Garrulous Grocer (S37). He built a good reputation with the city by providing food out of his pocket to the many left homeless and destitute by the ravaging of Myrkul's minions. Nearly a decade later, Nindil was selected to be a Lord. He now speaks for the common folk of Waterdeep.

Six months ago, Nindil was killed and subsumed by Hlaavin, the greater doppelganger ${ }^{\text {NIF }}$ who leads the Unseen (see page 57 ). Mather Ukkhemn of the Knights of the Shield (see page 74) betrayed Nindil's identity in a fit of pique for a healthy monetary inducement. For now, Hlaavin is content to continue in Nindil's guise, doing nothing untoward to reveal his deception. However, Hlaavin sees this victory as the first step of many in his longterm plan to supplant the Lords of Waterdeep.

Mirt the Moneylender: Also known as Mirt the Merciless and the Old Wolf, Mirt (CG male Tethyrian human fighter 8/rogue 5) is fully detailed on page 181 of the Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting. Mirt's fortified mansion (C52) sits on the southern flank of Mount Waterdeep above Smuggler's Dock. His wife, Asper, is an informal member of the Gray Hands (see page 37 ).

Larissa Neathal: Larissa (NG female Chondathan expert 10) is a human chameleon, capable with cosmetics and minor magics of changing her hairstyle, hair color, eye color, and dress in the wink of an eye. Her only constants are her distinctive necklace, a gold filigree phoenix rising from a cluster of inset rubies (periapt of proof against poison), and her taste for extravagant, provocative clothes. Larissa is a courtesan, playing a giggling, empty-headed sex-kitten with all the visiting envoys and diplomats she has time for, and gathering all the information for the Lords that she can that way. When weary or upset, she leans on the shoulder of her closest friend and confidante, Durnan the Wanderer. Her capacity for court parties is legendary, and she can dance all day and all night if necessary, without ill effects. Larissa keeps a house on Mulgomir's Way (C77).

Nymara "Kitten" Scheiron: "Kitten" (NG female Tethyrian human rogue 12) is an intensely secretive person whose full name is known to few. This tousle-haired, fierce woman has a savage temper and a lush, strong figure that belies her years. Although she can appear as a stunning, beautiful lady of high station, she is more often found heavily perfumed and made-up, posing as a Dock Ward tavern dancer. In less distinctive garb, she is an expert at following people, often taking to the sewers or rooftops when speed is of the essence.

---

Mirt and Durnan recruited this sometime thief more than twenty-five years ago for her understanding of the common folk, and her practicality influences the details of many actions planned by the Lords. Among her fellow Lords, "Kitten" is closest with Mirt, Durnan, Larissa, and Khelben. She keeps several residences scattered about the city, never staying in any one of them for any length of time.

Sammereza "Sammer" Sulphontis: Sammereza el Sufontis ( N male Calishite human expert 15), who employs a variant of his name in the North, is a slightly slimmer, slightly younger, and far more polished version of Mirt. He keeps his brown skin and hair meticulously groomed, and his purples eyes are quite hypnotic. Sammereza is a sly, witty, iron-nerved, sometimes oily wheeler-dealer with sharp eyes that miss nothing.

Sammereza hails from Calimshan but has made his home in the City of Splendors for over thirty-five years. He still favors many layers of silk and extravagant robes, keeping comfortable in northern climes with his ring of warmth, perhaps because he spends so much time traveling. Sammereza will sell anything to anyone, buy almost anything from anyone, and trade most things with most people. When he is in the city, Sammereza takes a room at the Purple Palace (D25).

In recent years, Sammereza has become increasingly tangled in the affairs of his homeland. The recent death of Sammereza's elder brother, Pasha Ahmahd el Sufontis of Calimport's Trades Ward, and the subsequent strife among Sammereza's four nephews and sister-in-law have nearly bankrupted the family fortunes. Moreover, Sammereza's simmering war with the el Synabbat family (a front for the ruling el Pesarkhal family), whose machinations in Skullport have suffered greatly due to Sammereza's interference, is threatening to erupt anew. Sammereza's sister-in-law, widow of Ahmahd, has just become the second wife of the weak, craven Harun yn Bajir el Synabbat (NE male Calishite human commoner 1), cementing her alliance with Harun's first wife and Sammereza's primary enemy, Saida yr Oma yr Pesarkhal el Synabbat (LE female Calishite commoner 7). What began as Sammereza acting on behalf of the Lords in Skullport might soon metastasize into a plague of Calishite assassins pursing a blood vendetta against Sammereza and anyone he associates with in the shadows of Waterdeep.

Texter: Texter (LG male Chondathan human paladin 20 [Tyr]) is a powerfully built, dutiful, pious holy warrior, with a face ruddy and lined, a thick, brown mustache, and a stern, distinguished visage. Fearless but never stupid, he has little patience for ceremony, preferring such activities as leading guard and navy patrols to the cut-and-thrust of just-below-the-surface politics. Texter's vigilance has saved the city from being surprised on more than one occasion, although he still berates himself for the attacks he has missed. When he needs to renew his commitment to the Maimed God, Texter rides forth alone into the wilderness to battle orcs, trolls, and other evil creatures. Texter has little respect for the cleric hierarchy in the Halls of Justice, feeling they spend more time jockeying for position than they do serving the will of Grimjaws. On those rare occasions when he is not in the field, Texter dwells at the Guard Barracks (C19).

### Mercenaries and Guides

The City of Splendors is home to countless fighting-men, some of them employed in the armed forces of Waterdeep and others in the private militias of Waterdeep's nobility. A large underclass of warriors intermittently inhabit Dock Ward and South Ward, finding rude accommodations until the next caravan, adventuring company, or warmonger needs their services. Others find employ as guides, leading nobles, adventuring companies, and caravans into the North in hopes of reducing the danger of getting lost or blundering into the territory of some monster.

A sampling of mercenaries and guides are detailed below:  
Blazidon One-Eye: Blazidon (CN male Tethyrian human fighter 7/expert 2) is a large, stocky man with graying hair and a patchy, unkempt beard. Although slightly overweight, his many scars and thickly muscled shoulders and arms mark him as a fighter from days past. He still comes out of retirement from time to time, but days are now occupied as a "poor hiring agent for sell-swords" and (secret) owner of the Bowels of the Earth tavern (T36), where he lives. Blazidon spends his nights making the rounds of the city's inns and taverns, befriending poor newcomers who might be willing to hire themselves out as fighters or guards. By day, he can be found, still armed to the teeth, in Virgin's Square\$GS: on map?, where most caravan masters know to find him. His fee is one copper piece per person hired, and Blazidon will contact sell-swords for clients, bringing them together to talk business in a little room of the taproom of his tavern. Blazidon is one of the few people in the city who dislikes Filiare of the Inn of the Dripping Dagger (T3), as the two are rivals in the field of finding jobs for hireswords.

Filiare: Filiare (LN male Illuskan human fighter 5/expert 5) is a jovial, middle-aged man whose thinning black hair and moustache are streaked with gray. Despite his years of retirement from the field, Filiare has maintained the strong physique that made him a highly paid mercenary all those decades ago. Filiare used his earnings to purchase the Inn of the Dripping Dagger (T3), now a favored home and watering place for many mercenaries. He is a good, kind, considerate host, more than willing to shave a few coppers off his prices for folks down on their luck. Filiare supplements his income by selling used weapons he keeps on hand (many given to him in lieu of payment by down-on-their-luck warriors) and he competes with Blazidon One-Eye to be the city's leading job-finder for hireswords.

Myrmith Splendon: Myrmith (LN male Tethyrian human fighter 12) is a handsome, clean-shaven man with light-brown, curly hair, light-blue eyes, and a ragged scar across his forehead. His build is light and disarming, but his strength is easily proven in combat. He is always clad in chainmail with a black tabard, alert and ready for action. Myrmith is a "captain-at-arms" (a professional tutor of fighters) who will train willing students in the use of bladed weapons or pole arms. He does not specialize in any particular weapon, but tries to master the greatest number of weapons possible. His fees are steep, but his instruction excellent, and there is often a waitlist of a tenday or more unless one is

---

willing to pay double. Myrmith lives in his house on Spindle Street (T7) and he is always busy training clients there.

Aluar Zendos: Aluar (CG male Tethyrian human ranger 6 [Mielikki]) is a quiet, unassuming man of muscular build, a hawklike face, and an uncompromising hatred for evil creatures. Aluar is a restless man who does not know what to do in life, but feels his destiny lies with Waterdeep. He recently acquired a singing "tword" ${ }^{\text {thin }}$, fulfilling a long held wish for a magic weapon, but its unusual nature has led him first to New Olamn (C72) and now to Those Who Harp and the beginnings of a new friendship with Vedellen Hawkhand (NG male half-sun elf ranger 11).

Aluar keeps a room at the Inn of the Dripping Dagger (T3) when in Waterdeep, but regularly makes the rounds of inns and taverns in the Trades Ward. He will offer himself as a guide or caravan-guard for $1 \mathrm{sp} /$ day for any traveling as far north as the mountains allow, as far east as Westgate, or as far south as the cities of Amn. He will readily tutor other rangers as well for $5 \mathrm{sp} /$ day.

### MONSTERS

The City of Splendors is home to a significant population of monsters. Such creatures generally fall into three camps: those that live openly among the folk of Waterdeep, those who prey on the population like foxes in the henhouse, and those who play a parasitic role within the City of Splendors. Most Waterdhavian "monsters" are loners, at least with respect to their own kind, but those who do work in concert from the shadows often wield a great deal of hidden influence in the city.

### Drapons

Although Abghairon's dragonward reduces the number of dragons living in the City of Splendors, many wyrms either live within the mythal's strictures or keep a close watch on Waterdeep. Some of the more prominent representatives of dragonkind to do so include the following individuals:

Claugiyliamatar: From her lair in Deeping Cave in the depths of Kryptgarden Forest, "Old Gnawbones" schemes and watches Waterdeep through an array of crystal balls. Claugiyliamatar is fascinated by powerful human and elf females as well as magics that enable a dragon to take on human form. She hungers to participate in the hustle and bustle of city life, but she has not yet found a way of doing so that preserves her personal security.

In particular, the members of the Brokengulf family seek her death, for Old Gnawbones once posed as a silver dragon that offered to rid the Brokengulf grazing lands of herself. When the affair was over, Lord Saerlin Brokengulf was crippled, three of his sisters were dead, the family nearly bankrupted, and a hastily mustered Waterdhavian strike force had conveniently slain a young male green dragon with designs on Claugiyliamatar's domain.

Old Gnawbones employs dozens of human and halfling agents to manipulate events in the City of Splendors. She also indirectly sponsors adventuring companies, such as the dozen highborn Waterdhavian ladies of the Bloodred Crown adventuring company, which she discretely leads to ruins and tombs near Waterdeep and Neverwinter. Old Gnawbones invests her earnings  
so as to stir up rivalries and strengthen organizations she controls to create more trouble and squeeze out more profits.

Base of Operations: Basement of the Wyrmbones Inn (C78).  
Gnawbones (Minor Criminal): AL NE, LE, N; 3,000 gp resource limit; Membership 40 (half in Waterdeep, half in Neverwinter); Isolated (green dragon 1, human 36, halfling 3); Dues $10 \mathrm{gp} /$ month ( 200 gp to join).

Special: All members of the society must be able to speak Draconic.

Jalanvaloss: The Wyrm of Many Spells (LN female mature adult steel dragon) hides amid the citizenry of Waterdeep in the shape of a female human, revealing herself only to savagely fight off any dragon who dares try to do her city harm. She is a keen observer of the smallest detail who revels in participating in as many intrigues and deceptions as possible. An actress of the first rank and an adequate mimic, she enjoys manipulating others and scheming. She has become expert in recalling the genealogies, relationships, cabals, and alliances of Waterdhavians high and low. She is active in the city underlife but also enjoys the entertainment provided by the pretensions and indulgences of its nobles.

Nymmurh: The Wyrm Who Watches (LG male ancient bronze dragon) has scryed the Silmerhelve family (apparently chosen at random in centuries past) through magic mirrors and portraits that can also act as temporary portals since at least the Year of the Nightmaidens (1032 DK). Fascinated by humans' predictability and unpredictability, Nymmurh tries to manipulate the Silmerhelves to be kinder, gentler, and slower to act before consequences are considered. He usually reveals himself to one Silmerhelve family member per generation, while the others regard him as mere family legend. Nymmurh protects the family against attacks from without and within, but does not watch over every wayward family member out seeking his fortune. He likes to attend family revels, sometimes appearing as a long-dead family member "returned from the grave" (usually the mumbling-mad Lady Saerista Silmerhelve, who dwells comfortably in the dragon's lair). Nymmurh's lair, which he calls "the Pit," lies in the high peaks of Alaron in the Moonshaes. He is known to have taught at least some Silmerhelves the spell jumpsout".

### The Plague Rats

Waterdeep's dark underbelly has long been home to wererats, a lycanthropic plague that the Lords have never wholly eradicated. In recent years, as the number of threats occupying the Lords has grown, the wererat population has grown in number to its highest point in decades. Concurrent with this population growth, the rodent lycanthropes have been assimilated into the Plague Rats, an elite organization of thieves, assassins, and wererats active throughout the Western Heartlands and the North and dedicated to Talona, the Mistress of Disease.

In Waterdeep, the Plague Rats largely operate in Dock Ward and the sewers under cover of darkness, although they perform clandestine missions anywhere in the city for hire. Currently, the group is focused on expanding their ranks and extending their reach into every aspect of Dock Ward's seamier side. Ironically, only the burgeoning power of the Shadow Thieves and the Xanathar Thieves' Guild is keeping the Plague Rats in check.

Base of Operations: The Rat's Maw of the Raf Hills, Deloun Alley (see page 113), and Skullport.

Plague Rats (Expansive Criminal): AL LE, NE; 40,000 gp resource limit; Membership 436; Mixed (wererats 161, humans 87, half-orcs 78 , halflings 44 , others 66 ); Dues $50 \mathrm{gp} /$ month ( 50 gp to join).

Authority Figure: Plaguemistress Teltaera of the Seven Blights (LE female wererat [augmented Chondathan human] cleric 7/Talontar blightlord ${ }^{\text {Uwe }} 3 /$ assassin 3 [Talona]).

Special: All members must choose Talona as their patron deity and demonstrate a knack for stealth and skullduggery (2 ranks in Hide).

### Savants of the Dark Tide

In the Year of the Gauntlet ( 1369 DR), a wave of monsters from the depths of the Sea of Swords swept into Waterdeep Harbor, nearly overrunning the defenders of Dock Ward. Among their number were a dozen or so aboleths, most of whom were slain during the Deepwater War. However, among their number was a trio of aboleths from the Swordsea Depths who joined the Army of Iakhovas with the deliberate intent of using the assault to sneak into Waterdeep's sewers. During the chaos and confusion, the Savants of the Dark Tide swam into foulest heart of the sewer, where they have since established a nigh-impregnable lair.

The Swordsea Depths are the region of the Underdark that extends out into the continental shelf beneath the Sea of Swords.

As described in UM L6: The Seadeeps (see page 128), this region of the Underdark is wracked by a never-ending three-way war between the aboleths, the drow, and an alliance of svirfneblin and tomb tappers ${ }^{\mathrm{MP}}$. The Savants of the Dark Tide came to Waterdeep in pursuit of an ancient legend in hopes of gaining a decisive advantage in that war. If the Savants of the Dark Tide can locate and resuscitate the Sargauth Swimmer (a legendary aboleth of enormous size and age rumored to lie dreaming in the Sargauth River), the knowledge it possesses might tip the balance in their interminable war.

Since their arrival, the aboleths have moved cautiously, seeking to understand the city above their heads before moving into the depths. The Savants quickly determined that the only organized activity in the sewers was performed by members of the Cellarers' \& Plumbers' Guild. As such, individual rogues and others who will not be missed are captured and transformed into skum, whenever possible; however, guild members are enslaved and instructed to stay away from certain parts of the sewers and to stay within the city of Waterdeep, but they are otherwise left to do their jobs. By using already enslaved members to lure more senior members of the guild, the aboleths have thus enslaved the entire leadership of the guild as well.

Base of Operations: Drain of Madness (SF77).  
Savants of the Dark Tide (Standard Criminal): AL LE; 15,000 gp resource limit; Membership 86; Isolated (aboleths 3, skum 45, charmed others 38); Dues $0 \mathrm{gp} /$ month ( 0 gp to join).

Authority Figure: Nexil'Vendyliq (LE advanced 18 HD aboleth sorcerer 6/aboleth savant ${ }^{\mathrm{LM}} 5$ ).

Important Characters: Avidna'Delinskyun (LE advanced 12 HD aboleth sorcerer 6/aboleth savant ${ }^{\mathrm{LM}}$ 4); InkyllDeskiloop (NE advanced 13 HD aboleth bard 8/aboleth savant ${ }^{\mathrm{LM}} 1$ ).

Special: Membership in this organization is involuntary, except for the aboleths. Skum are transformed slaves; and all other members are enslaved proxies of their piscine masters.

### The Unseen

The Unseen is a consortium of shapechangers, thieves, illusionists, and assassins that has been growing in strength and numbers in Waterdeep for nearly three decades. The Unseen began as a drnuth (a band of doppelgangers led by illithids), tasked to infiltrate and spy on the City of Splendors for the Underdark city of Ch'Chitl. The death of the elder brain of the Kingdom Below forced the drunth to operate largely on its own, enabling a greater doppelganger ${ }^{\mathrm{MP}}$ named Hlaavin to emerge as the leader of the now-autonomous band.

Aside from the creation of the Waterdeep-based wilora (see page 141), the successes of the Unseen are largely unknown, but failures and setbacks include the death of Flaern Cragsmere during a failed attempt to infiltrate that family, the Rat Hills Conflagration (which drove the doppelgangers wholly into the city), and the unmasking of the Hanging Lantern festhall (D22) when the infamous Volothamp Geddarm revealed that the courtesans were doppelgangers. Despite these setbacks, the Unseen finally appear poised to achieve true power in the City of Splendors, having finally placed one of their own in the ranks

---

of the Lords of Waterdeep, and having learned the identity of "the One," leader of the Red Sashes.

Base of Operations: Formerly the Hanging Lantern (D22), now secret rooms within the Dungeon of the Crypt, the sewers, and Skullport.

The Unseen (Standard Criminal): AL NE, CE, LE; 15,000 gp resource limit; Membership 67; Isolated (doppelgangers 26, humans 12, greater doppelgangers ${ }^{\mathrm{MF}} 9$, changesteed leucrotta ${ }^{\mathrm{a}}$ 7, malaugrym ${ }^{\mathrm{MF}} 1$, wilora ${ }^{\mathrm{a}} 9$, phasm 5); Dues 50 gp/month ( 500 gp to join).

Authority Figure: Hlaavin (see below).  
Important Characters: Amarune (see below); Drejjd (N doppelganger); Kerrigan Ellstric (NE male Illuskan rogue 5/assassin 7); Pharem Ellstric (CE male human illusionist 10); Fengharl of the Unseen (NE doppelganger); Kkruq (NE changesteed leucrotta ${ }^{\text {a }}$ ); Necrom Regescar (LE male lightfoot halfling rogue 9); "Synyl" (appears to be a CE doppelganger, see Nylaersyn "the Changeling" Floshin below); Tomas Siohcen (see page 38); Uhkra (NE changesteed leucrotta ${ }^{\mathrm{a}}$ ); Lasster Vhenlok (CE male Tethyrian human fighter 7).

Associated Classes: Bard, druid, fighter, ranger, rogue, sorcerer, wizard.

Associated Skills: Bluff, Disguise, Escape Artist, Hide, Knowledge (dungeoneering), Sense Motive.

Requirements: Do not divulge the secrets of the brotherhood to any outsiders.

Pavored in Guild Fringe Benefit: Due to your long association with many shapechangers, you gain a +2 bonus on Spot and Sense Motive checks made to see through a Disguise or Bluff attempt.

Special: Any creature with the shapechanger subtype can join, regardless of character class (or lack thereof). If you are not a shapechanger, you must demonstrate skill in deception and subterfuge ( 2 ranks in Bluff and 2 ranks in Disguise) or have the ability to alter your form magically (alter self, polymorph, wild shape, or similar spells or abilities).

The Unseen are primarily, but not exclusively, made up of creatures with the shapechanger subtype.

Amarune: Amarune (CE malaugrym ${ }^{\mathrm{MF}}$ sorcerer 5) has long been absent from Shadowhome, the fortress of the Blood of Malaug on the Plane of Shadow, fearing death from her kin for some long-forgotten sin if she is ever discovered. Amarune has posed as Nael Irlingstar for over three decades, eschewing the plots of her kin and living quietly among Waterdeep's nobility, in accordance with the Dark Decree of the Great Shadowmaster Dhalgrave. The death of her daughter Sintre left House Irlingstar without a direct heir and Amarune alone with the magic baubles she had acquired. Two years ago, Hlaavin, who somehow discovered her deception, abruptly confronted Amarune and gave her the choice of joining the Unseen or being exposed for what she was. Amarune has reluctantly begun supplying the Unseen with funds purloined from House Irlingstar's coffers and magic she has accumulated. The shadowmaster secretly burns with hatred for the doppelganger, and, as Hlaavin fully expects, intends to betray the greater doppelganger at the first opportunity.

Nylaersyn "the Changeling" Floshin: Nylaersyn (CE female fey'ri ${ }^{\mathrm{MF}}$ sorcerer 6) is a member of House Dlardrageth who has adopted the guise of a doppelganger, allowing her to infiltrate the Unseen in the guise of "Synyl." In the guise of Synyl, Nylaersyn has also adopted the guise of several Waterdhavians: Biafyndar Loceath (CG male gold elf), an initiate of Corellon Larethian at the Pantheon Temple of the Seldarine (C66), Hragnor Splitstone (male Illuskan human), a fletcher at Riautar's Weaponry (T18), and Tymaara Moonsmile (CG female half-moon elf), a waitress at the Elfstone Tavern (C32).

Gonehl: Gonehl (CE doppelganger), in the guise of Aquila Gerallin, leads the Masquerade. This shadowy group acts outside of Waterdeep as the information network and mercenary arm of the Unseen and includes more than one hundred members specialized in infiltration, spying, and poisoning. As they are reasonably honorable and seem to have no dark, hidden motives, few suspect that the Masquerade is actually an arm of the Unseen.

Hlaavin: Hlaavin (NE half-illithid ${ }^{\text {Und }}$ greater doppelganger ${ }^{\mathrm{MF}}$ sorcerer 9) is the driving force behind the Unseen, a greater doppelganger who lacks the self-centered, cowardly nature common to most doppelgangers and their ilk. Hlaavin is a master manipulator, consumed with envy for those who have more power, money, and prestige. Hlaavin sees the Unseen as a means of achieving true power in the City of Splendors, and Waterdeep as the first step in his plot to take control of the entire Sword Coast North. Hlaavin has accomplished something no other doppelganger ever has, keeping its druuth united without an outside controller. The secret of Hlaavin's efforts is its illithid ancestry, an experiment initiated by the illithids of Ch'Chitl to see if it would make their druuth more effective. The leader of the Unseen keeps its ancestry secret even from its fellow doppelgangers.

Hlaavin's current roster of identities include: Chievel (LN male Chondathan commoner 2), the major-domo of the Kothont villa and right-hand-man of Lord Kothont; Lady Cyrtue (CE female human commoner 5), owner of the Hanging Lantern festhall (D22), Thad Ruchel (NE male Illuskan human rogue 7), leader of the Luskan-based adventuring band Mask's Conscripts, and Nindil Jalbuck (see page 54), now his primary identity.

Ptola: Ptola (NE greater doppelganger ${ }^{\mathrm{MF}}$ rogue 9) is a cold, scheming creature that enjoys torturing its victims before assuming their identities. Ptola's current roster of identities include Kamlann ( N male Chondathan human commoner 1), a member of the Dungsweepers' Guild, Murklar (LG male Tethyrian human commoner 1), a penitent hunchback and janitor of the Wyvern's Rest inn (\$2), Thurn Blackskull (LE male duergar psychic warrior ${ }^{\text {X }}{ }^{\text {N }}$ 9), a fence specializing in rare and magic weapons, Senya (CN female Gur human expert 1), courtesan at the Golden Horn Gambling House (T28), Wendyll Thintoworth (CN male half-moon elf sorcerer 4/rogue 5/assasin 1) of Mask's Conscripts, and Jurisk Ulhammond (see page 75). At present, Ptola and its agents simply seek to infiltrate as many factions in Skullport as possible and slowly increase the group's influence in the Port of Shadow.

### Vampires

Artor Morlin, once a Shoon outlaw, then Lord Baron of Morlin Castle and the Steeping Falls, then a vampiric mercenary lord famed for his hatred of all things Calishite, has dwelled in the City of Splendors since the Second Troll War. Artor (LE male vampire fighter 13/blackguard 3/master vampire ${ }^{1,1,64} 7$ ) sees Waterdeep as his personal hunting preserve and brooks no challenges from rival vampires to his domain. As a result, Waterdeep is home to far fewer vampires preying on the citizenry than might otherwise be the case for a city of its size. Artor takes care to keep his depredations within the city to a minimum, giving him a secure and profitable base in which to live out his immortality. For more on Artor's lair, see the Fireplace Level, page 118.

### Nobility

Since the founding of Nimoar's Hold in the Year of the Curse (882 DR), wealthy merchant families in what is now Waterdeep have claimed the mantle of nobility. In some cases, such claims were based on the awarding of nobility to the familial line by another sovereign realm; in others, such claims reflected the aspirations of a powerful family with the means to demand such honorifics from their neighbors.

In the Year of the Cockatrice ( 1248 DR), the Lords of Waterdeep recognized the merchant gentry, marking the formal beginnings of the Waterdhavian nobility. In some cases, they retroactively acknowledged a longstanding claim, allowing the family to date its ennoblement to an earlier date. However, the Lords carefully insisted there was no established order of precedence or seniority, preventing the formal establishment of an "old guard."

Ahghairon proposed the establishment of a nobility as both a matter of practicality and of diplomacy. From a practical standpoint, the chaotic use of widely varying titles among the populace prompted all manner of disputes and feuds and threatened the authority of the Lords. (At one point, there were no less then twelve "Dukes of Waterdeep" among just three families.) As a diplomatic carrot, the city used the granting of titles to lure powerful, land-owning lords from the surrounding countryside and wealthy merchants from lands far away into the city. In so doing, Ahghairon drew new wealth to the city and prevented the emergence of numerous tiny statelets in Waterdeep's backyard that might incessantly war among themselves and thus threaten the city's prosperity.

Since the Year of the Cockatrice, noble families have been granted the right to bear arms, including small private armies of up to seventy warriors. (Non-noble families, businesses, and individuals are restricted to sixteen warriors by edict of the Lords.) Nobles have also been granted the right to bear "arms of grace," a coat-of-arms borne by all warriors and low-ranking servants in their service. The noble families have always been required to contribute one percent of their annual earnings to the city coffers, payable each Midsummer, for the defense and maintenance of the city. Slave trading is forbidden, and all families were required to renounce it upon induction in the Year of the Cockatrice ( 1248 DR ). Several backsliding houses (includ-  
ing Anteos, Kormallis, and Thann) were required to renounce it again upon the restoration of the Lords' rule in the Year of the Wagon ( 1273 DR).

Over time, the rate at which new families are ennobled by the Lords of Waterdeep has greatly diminished. Effectively, Waterdeep's nobility is now a "closed shop," as no new family has been ennobled since the Year of the Snow Winds ( 1337 DR). As Waterdeep's power has grown, the need to lure minor nobles from the surrounding countryside into the city has diminished, and the current families have no interest in reducing the value of their pedigrees by "sharing the wealth," as it were. In recent years, there has been some talk of ennobling the Duke of Daggerford and thus drawing that town more formally into Waterdeep's orbit, but for now such discussions have gone nowhere.

All noble families are considered at least "minor organizations," once you include servants, retainers, and the like. Almost all noble families are "isolated" in racial make-up (at least among the blooded kin), with noble members almost exclusively human. (Rare exceptions include families with half-elves, half-dragons, tieflings, liches, mummies, werewolves, or yuan-ti among their living relatives.)

In the current era, the number of actual nobles per noble family varies between a dozen and six dozen, but such figures include all acknowledged relatives, sometimes as far as fourth cousins from the current patriarch. Typically, the number of blood relatives of the patriarch of each family resident in the city is about fifteen or so.

Titles, lands, and funds can be inherited by any child or heir of a noble patriarch or matriarch. The standard practice in the Waterdeep assumes the eldest child (regardless of sex) inherits the title and the majority holdings of a family, with younger siblings and other relations getting lesser legacies. Living rulers of a noble family can proclaim a different heir should they choose, but such a proclamation must take place in the Lord's Court and be confirmed by the Lords, keeping the city rulers appraised of who stands to inherit the lands and titles (and avoiding any problems with contesting the inheritance after a ruler's passing). The changing of an heir is rare, although a number of heirs have refused family lands and titles, dedicating their lives to religious orders or adventuring. In cases where leadership of the family is contested, the Lords of Waterdeep make the final determination.

Matriarchal families are not uncommon in Waterdeep. Established matriarchs wishing to marry a nobleman can choose to adopt his name and family holdings (at which time she would abdicate her title and legacy to her chosen heir), or her husband can become a matriarch's consort (at which time he would abdicate any former family inheritances and holdings in order to share in his wife's title and station). If either spouse (or both) is a solitary heir with no heirs to receive his or her title, the family portfolios can combine under one name and one titular head of house or create an entirely new dynasty.

Some noble families, such as the Houses Deepwinter and Maernos, do go extinct, but the Lords usually work behind the scenes to arrange a hasty marriage to prevent such occurrences. Aside from the Houses Gildeggh and Zoar, there have been four such extinctions over Waterdeep's history. Many wealthy,

---

would-be nobles have viewed such extinctions as an opportunity for their own elevation to the nobility, but in practice there is little tie between the two.

### Ascending to the Nobility

Although it is often easier to marry into an existing noble family, individuals of wealth and influence can petition the Lords of Waterdeep to ennoble them and their descendants. Although the Lords of Waterdeep have never spelled out strict criteria for granting such petitions, some informal strictures have been deduced by would-be nobles over the years:

An individual should have demonstrable personal wealth, in excess of $25,000 \mathrm{gp}$, that has been largely acquired through mercantile endeavors. (Adventurers who recover large amounts of treasure do not provide the same ongoing economic impact to Waterdeep as a wealthy merchant who employs hundreds of Waterdhavians.)

An individual should reside in Waterdeep except when wintering in the South or leading trade expeditions.

An individual should own several significant properties in the City of Waterdeep.

An individual should play a prominent role in one or more guilds.

An individual should be human. (Although some Lords might wish otherwise, the other families are unlikely to accept a nonhuman ennobled family any time soon.)

An individual should be "sponsored" by at least five other noble families.

The key criterion is, of course, the last one. It takes a staggering amount of wealth, connections, debts, charitable giving, bribes, and humility to get five noble families to agree that it is in their best interest to add a new family to the nobility.

### Adarbrent

House Adarbrent is one Waterdeep's leading shipping clans, with strong ties to the navy and the Master Mariners' Guild.  
'History: Lord Royus and his father came to Waterdeep from Cormyr in the Year of Storms (1310 DR). The Adarbrent Shipping Company was a success from the start and the family joined the nobility a mere seven years later. Lord Royus now has the third largest fleet of ships in Waterdeep (after the City Guard and Guild of Watermen).

Plots \& Intrigues: House Adarbrent initiated the Horizon Armada, a league of noble ship owners, and continues to play a key role in the command of the fleet and the creation of the resulting maps. Initially, the Adarbrent clan made a fortune on the trade with New Waterdeep, and several of Royus' brothers set up shop in the new world. Thanks to Beshaba's fickle hand, the Deepwater War and the assault on Evermeet hurt the Adarbrent fleet much more than its partners, leaving the house in dire financial straits. Now, Lord Royus is reluctantly entertaining offers of large amounts of money at very reasonable rates from his daughter's father-in-law, whose only condition is that the Adarbrents sign a contract with the Rundeen. Through an  
intermediary, Lord Royus is looking to hire a band of adventurers with no previous connection to House Adarbrent to investigate the business dealings of Fahd yn Sarsor al Nisr to see what he might be getting into if he accepts the offer.

House Adarbrent (Minor Noble): AL LG, NG; 15,000 gp resource limit; Membership 86; Isolated ( 73 human, 8 halfling, 3 . half-elf, 2 other); Salary 15 gp/month for house agents or stipend of 75 gp/month for clan members (no cost to join).

Authority Figure: Royus Adarbrent (see below).  
Important Characters: Alroy Adarbrent (see below); Ellis Adarbrent (see below); Syllia Adarbrent (see below).

Associated Classes: Aristocrat, expert, fighter, rogue.  
Associated Skills: Appraise, Diplomacy, Forgery, Knowledge (local), Knowledge (nobility and royalty), Profession (sailor).

Requirements: If you are an agent of the House, you must serve an average of 20 hours per tenday attending Adarbrent business. If you are a member of House Adarbrent, you must devote an average of 30 hours per tenday to dealing with House business.

Favored in Guild Fringe Benefit: Your connections with Waterdeep's merchant nobility give you a jump on finding the best market for a valuable item. Once per character level, you can sell a magic item for $100 \%$ of its market value (or an art object or gem for $120 \%$ of its normal value).

Special: You can only be a clan member if the DM approves.

Key members of House Adarbrent include:  
Alroy Adarbrent: Alroy (NG male Chondathan human aristocrat 1/expert 9) is a thin, weak man with a keen mind and perpetual cough. He is one of the best navigators in the city, having completed the arduous trip to New Waterdeep and back. This committed bachelor swore off women after being spurned by Galinda Raventree (who was barely aware of his interest) in favor of Regnet Amcathra, but he is now spending a great deal of time with Myrna Cassalanter.

Ellis Adarbrent: Born in the Year of the Moonfall (1344 DR), the third son of Royus, Ellis (LG male Illuskan aristocrat 3), is a very quiet man who stutters when he gets nervous. After completing an apprenticeship at Laran's Cartographers (S39), he is now a senior cartographer at Horizon's Sails (D62) and close friend of Winter Zalth (see page 76).

Royus Adarbrent: The aging patriarch of House Adarbrent, Royus (LG male human aristocrat 9) mourns the loss of his wife many years ago and is consumed with worry that the family is not in a strong enough financial position to weather his death.

Syllia Adarbrent: Syllia (CG female Illuskan aristocrat 1/fighter 5) is a spitfire with flaming red hair with temper and tenacity to match. A born seafarer, Syllia is captain of the Hippocampus, flagship of the Horizon Armada, and a member of Those Who Harp. This past spring, Syllia impulsively married her lover and fellow Harper, Farid yn Fahd al Nisr (CG male Calishite human wizard 5), to the dismay of her father and brothers. At the beginning of the season, the two set off for New Waterdeep and points beyond and have yet to return. Unfortunately (and unbeknownst to her), Farid's father, Fahd

---

yn Sarsor al Nisr (CE male Calishite human commoner 9), is a First Yrshelem of the Rundeen, with designs on the Adarbrent shipping fortunes.

### Amcathra

House Amcathra has a long and distinguished history in the service of Waterdeep, and a wide variety of trading interests. Scions of House Amcathra are active patrons of The Splendid Order of Armorers, Locksmiths, \& Finesmiths as well as The Vintners', Distillers', \& Brewers Guild. In addition, Lord Arilos just became Senior Master of the The Stablemasters' \& Farriers' Guild.

History: House Amcathra traces its lineage back to Rorgar Amcathra, a talented swordsmith who established a large horse-farm on the outskirts of Rowan Hold (now Amphail) in the wake of the First Trollwar, correctly perceiving a need to replenish the ranks of Waterdeep's much-depleted cavalry. The family grew wealthy in the years that followed, plowing its profits back into vineyard they built in the foothills of the Sword Mountains and nurturing the growth of a half dozen hamlets that fell within their lands. In the Year of the Cockatrice (1248 DR), Lord Hargrym Amcathra, great-grandfather of the current lord, accepted Waterdeep's offer of nobility and moved his family into the city, and House Amcathra has continued to prosper ever since.

Plots \& Intrigues: The blades of House Amcathra have long been acknowledged as the finest to be found in the City of Splendors, a reputation that has long been profitable for the family. Recently, however, House Gralhund has begun selling blades at cut-rate prices that seem far superior to those produced by House Amcathra.

Lord Arilos is gravely concerned of the effect on the family's finances should House Gralhund acquire a better reputation for blademaking. He suspects, but cannot prove, that the dramatic improvement in House Gralhund's blades results from a new alloy of metal unavailable to their competitors. The lord of House Amcathra is now looking for adventurers to determine the source of House Gralhund's recent ascendance. In particular, he hopes to either embarrass the rival house or, better yet, acquire a similar source for metal ingots for the forges of House Amcathra.

The newfound source of metal for House Gralhund's weapons is the duergar of Clan Xundorn. Specifically, House Gralhund has been trading with Thaglar's Foundry (LH11), shipping steel ingots laced with mithral to the surface and sending coins, food, and ale into the depths in exchange. If House Amcathra could obtain access to similar ingots, its superior craftsfolk could easily produce even better blades than those emerging from the smithies of House Gralhund.

Mourngrym Amcathra: The Lord of Shadowdale (NG male Chondathan human fighter 8) is a physically fit, neatly trimmed  
man with brown hair and beard. He has long been absent from the family affairs, but is now playing host to his aged parents, Challas (NG male Tethyrian human aristocrat 9) and Miri (LG female Tethyrian human aristocrat 9).

Galinda Raventree Amcathra: Galinda (CG female Tethyrian human aristocrat 5/expert 2), recently married to Regnet Amcathra, is one of Waterdeep's leading socialites and, until recently, one of its most desirable ladies. The younger sister of Lord Surakh Raventree is now the mother of two, but producing heirs for House Amcathra has not stopped her from hosting Waterdeep's annual costume ball or engaging in rumormongering. Galinda greatly dislikes Myrna Cassalanter and enjoys beating her at her own game. She can be contacted at the Amcathra villa (N34).

Regnet Amcathra: The younger brother of Arilos (NG male Chondathan fighter 5) is a tall man with curly brown hair and a fierce temper. Famed for his tastes in clothes and drink, he has friends and enemies in nearly every tavern in town. He considers Danilo Thann (see page 63), Civilar Emmer Jundhyl (see page 37), Mother Tathlorn, and Scirkhel Wands among his closest confidantes. He is also a founder of the Deep Delvers adventuring company. Regnet has settled down since marrying Galinda Raventree. Myrna Cassalanter continues to badmouth the pair whenever she can, but most folk ignore such sniping.

### MOONSTar

### Crest of

House Amcathra

House Moonstar is one of Waterdeep's oldest families, with strong ties to the Church of Selûne, the Master Mariners' Guild, and the Surveyors', Map \& Chart-makers' Guild.

History: The history of House Moonstar is largely recounted in the discussions of the Church of Selûne and the Church of Shar.

Plots \& Intrigues: The endless war between Lord Alathene and Lord Vanrak has long consumed the scions of House Moonstar. The current generation took it as a personal affront when Shar's avatar impersonated the Moonmaiden during the Time of Troubles, and it has redoubled its efforts to discover Lord Vanrak's hidden redoubt in the depths of Undermountain. In recent years, Lord Helve has sponsored no less than a dozen adventuring companies to delve the depths of Undermountain in hopes of finding his trail but so far to no avail. This has led to the despairing conclusion that there might simply be no physical link between the hidden temple of Shar and the rest of Undermountain.

The rise of the Shadow Thieves and their ability to slip between the shadows has given Lady Alathene a new idea: She intends to send a band of adventurers into the Plane of Shadow to establish a temporary base. From there, companies

---

of adventurers chartered by House Moonstar can search for Lord Vanrak's Undermountain in the shadow analog of Undermountain and then attack it from its point of greatest weakness. Of course, finding a band of adventurers able and willing to embark on a long sojourn on the Plane of Shadow is proving to be a challenge.

Alathene Moonstar: Lady Alathene (CG archlich ${ }^{\mathrm{MF}}$ [augmented Illuskan human] wizard 15/arcane devotee ${ }^{\mathrm{PE}} 5$ [Selûne]), long associated with Selûne's faith in the City of Splendors, is old and beautiful, with the regal air of a centuries-old aristocrat. She resides primarily at the Blushing Mermaid (D36), but she can frequently be found in her laboratory in the deepest cellars of the Vault of Stars (see page 120). Lady Alathene is consumed with the hunt for her brother, Lord Vanrak, and she will stop at nothing to make him pay for his crimes.

Feluna Moonstar: Feluna (NG female afflicted werecat ${ }^{\text {MF }}$ [augmented Illuskan human] cleric 5 [Selûne]) is the young, almost ethereally beautiful sister of Lord Rober. She evinces many of the personality traits commonly associated with felines, including a strong streak of independence, a nocturnal bent, and a hunter's mindset. Feluna first manifested her byanthropic abilities during the Time of Troubles after being kidnapped and left bound and gagged in the sewers for several days. The Moonmaiden answered her pleas for aid by transforming her into a cat. She now serves at the House of the Moon (\$56) as one of the Called, having grown comfortable with her newfound abilities.

Helve Moonstar: Helve (NG male Tethyrian aristocrat 9) is tall and of regal demeanor, with youthful muscles have that run to fat over the years. He was originally a captain in the Waterdhavian cavalry's Guard, but a vicious sword cut to his right leg cost him the long-term career he had been seeking and drove him into the family business, much to the delight of his father. While rebellious at first, Helve has matured and, with the guidance of his wife, successfully enlarged the Moonstar holdings. Helve secretly fears that his heir, Rober, does not have what it takes to be head of the clan, and he has taken to quietly testing his other nephews and nieces to see if one of them would make a better choice to succeed him.

Vanrak Moonstar: Lord Vanrak (NE male death knight ${ }^{\text {MM1 }}$ [augmented Tethyrian human] ranger 2/cleric 4/nightcloak ${ }^{\text {PF }}$ 10 [Shar]), the Dark Ranger, has long been the bogeyman of House Moonstar and the Church of Selûne, residing in the depths of Undermountain as the master of Vanrakdoom (UM SLM). Vanrak seeks nothing less than the destruction of the Moonmaiden, but is content to begin by destroying House Moonstar, the House of the Moon, and subjugating all of Waterdeep to the bitter comfort of the Dark Maiden.

Wylynd Moonstar: A quiet, dark-eyed woman, Wylynd (CG Illuskan human female aristocrat 7) is cautious and suspicious in her dealings with others. Her habit of planning and preparing for any contingency has allowed her husband to embark on several risky business ventures that have paid off handsomely, but this has made her few friends in the process. The younger sister of Naneatha Suaril (see page 75) is widely-and correctly-perceived as the true force behind the Moonstar fortunes.

House Thann is one of Waterdeep's leading vintners, with large land-holdings in the South and strong ties to Blackstaff Tower. They have strong ties with the Vintners', Distillers' \& Brewers' Guild.

History: House Thann traces its history back to a family of Velenese slave traders who built their fortune ferrying slaves from the Port of Shadow to southern lands, where slavery was legal. Over time, the family split into two branches, one based in Tethyr, now all-but-gone, and one based in Waterdeep. In the Year of Spilled Blood (1315 DR), Lord Rhammas Thann convinced his aging father, Lord Erktos I, to abandon the slave trade, and the family fortunes are now built on merchant shipping, fine wines, and land owning. The family maintains a hand in less reputable trade as well.

Plots \& Intrigues: The Thann clan is deeply engaged in the Reclamation of Tethyr and closely allied with Tethyr's royal house. The family's ties to the longdead Lhestyn Silmaeril Arunsun and involvement in Riatavin's joining with Tethyr have placed them in the midst of a burgeoning war with the Shadow Thieves. In the past years, this conflict has spilled into Waterdeep, with frequent attacks on Thann holdings by the resurgent thieves' guild.

Cassandra Thann: Cassandra (NG female Chondathan human aristocrat 12) is the indomitable, intellectual, longlived matriarch of the Thann clan, almost single-handedly responsible for resurrecting the family's fortunes after they abandoned the slave trade. Well versed in the cut-and-thrust of city politics, she has a nigh-encyclopedic knowledge of Waterdeep's history over the past century. Cassandra has nine children-Dartek, Eldaun, Randor, Zelphar, Harmon, Ildaera, Synthea, Danilo, and Judith-and thirteen grandchildren. She is the daughter of Zelphar Arunsun and his first wife, a half-elf, although she keeps this elven heritage a secret, pretending instead to rely on magic for her long years. Cassandra's half-brother is Khelben "Ravenscloak" Arunsun the Younger, whose identity Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun the Elder has assumed. Although Cassandra sometimes wonders, she does not suspect the deception.

---

Danilo Thann: Danilo (CG male Tethyrian human aristocrat 3/wizard 9/spellsinger ${ }^{\text {Bac }} 1$ ), sixth son of Rhammas and Cassandra, is a former apprentice of Khelben, a former Harper, and a former Lord of Waterdeep, instrumental in the founding New Olamn (C72). He is believed to be in Tethyr in the company of Arilyn Moonblade (CG female half-moon elf rogue 1/fighter 4/Harper agent ${ }^{\text {PG }} \boldsymbol{\gamma}$ ), but has largely dropped out of contact with his family.

Erktos Thann II: Erktos II (LG male Tethyrian human aristocrat 2/expert $\boldsymbol{\gamma}$ ), Royal Bailiff of Tethyr and second son of Dartek Thann, joined the Reclamation Army along with his uncle, Zelphar. Lord Erktos II's grasp of battle strategies, siege engineering, and castle construction made him crucial to the successful siege of Myratma.

Rhammas Thann: Rhammas (LN male Tethyrian human aristocrat $\boldsymbol{\gamma}$ ), the eldest son of Erktos I, is an honorable, hardworking man somewhat overshadowed by his wife Cassandra. The aging Thann patriarch has his failings, including siring an out-of-wedlock daughter named Lilly who was murdered by the Knights of the Shield, and in recent years he has largely retired from an active role in family affairs.

Zelphar Thann: Zelphar (LN male Tethyrian human aristocrat 8/cleric $\boldsymbol{\gamma}$ [Gond]), fourth son of Rhammas and Cassandra, is Tethyr's Count of Rivershire and Estate Chancellor, responsible for all public works. Zelphar has a knack for all things mechanical, which he put to good use maintaining the siege engines of the Reclamation Army, but his true love is wine, and he oversees most of the family's southern vineyards. He is also a member of the Merchant's Chosen of Riatavin, a role that has earned him the enmity of the Shadow Thieves and made him the target of frequent assassination attempts.

### Wands

House Wands is one of Waterdeep's leading magecraft clans, with strong ties to the Watchful Order of Magists \& Protectors and Blackstaff Tower. Members of the family are scattered across Faerûn, including Ellidis "Shadowink" Wands (CG halfmoon elf male rogue 3 /sorcerer 6/Arcane Trickster 1), making a name for himself as a thief in Calimshan, and Marcus "Marco Volo" Wands (CN male Tethyrian human bard 7), now off adventuring in the Heartlands.

History: House Wands is one of Waterdeep's oldest families, able to trace its ancestry back to a Magister of Mystra. The founder of the clan was Eldrus Sunstaff, a wizard from another world who came to Faerûn in the Year of the Narrow Escape ( $39 \boldsymbol{\gamma}$ DR), changed his surname to Wands, and then slew the reigning Magister in the Year of High Eyes ( 409 DR). Members of the family have always espoused a conservative approach to magic that many arcane spellcasters find incredibly restrictive. However, House Wands has played a critical role in ensuring that Waterdeep never fell victim to the magical excesses that consumed the once-proud city of Ascalhorn.

Plots \& Intrigues: Less than a decade ago, Marcus Wands stole an artifact known as the Dragonking's Eye from an evil wizard named Sabbar. After a series of adventures, Marcus  
ended up releasing the alien god bound within, known as the Dragonking. The Dragonking was defeated thanks to the intervention of Corellon Larethian, Sune, and Tyr, but its momentary liberation has had a strange effect. In the years since its release, creatures from the Far Realm have begun appearing the immediate vicinity of individual members of House Wands at random, but with distressing regularity. Maskar and Olanhar continue to seek a solution to this problem, but in the interim House Wands is in need of skilled adventurers to protect the less powerful members of House Wands whenever they venture forth from the heavily warded Wands villa.

House Wands (Standard Noble): AL LN, LG; 15,000 gp resource limit; Membership 99; Isolated ( 77 human, 9 halfling, 7 elf, 4 half-elf, 2 other); Salary $20 \mathrm{gp} /$ month for house agents or stipend of $100 \mathrm{gp} /$ month for clan members (no cost to join).

Authority Figure: Maskar Wands (see below).  
Important Characters: Scirkhel Wands (see below); Olanhar Wands (see below).

Associated Classes: Aristocrat, expert, fighter, rogue, sorcerer, wizard.

Associated Skills: Diplomacy, Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge (local), Knowledge (nobility and royalty), Spellcraft, Use Magic Device.

Requirements: If you are an agent of the House, you must serve an average of 20 hours per teriday attending Wands business. If you are a member of House Wands, you must devote an average of 30 hours per teriday to dealing with House business.

Favored in Guild Fringe Benefit: House Wands subsidizes the costs of any magic item you create, reducing the cost of raw material components by $20 \%$.

Special: You can only be a clan member if the DM approves.

Notable Wands nobles include:  
Maskar Wands: Maskar (LN male Tethyrian human wizard 20/Archmage 3) is the rarely seen, traditional, conservative patriarch of the Wands clan. He favors traditional wizard's robes, and he is gracious in manner and gestures. Maskar is known for his strict disapproval of the abuse of magic and its wasteful, unrestrained use, to the point of even chastising the Blackstaff from time to time. Although Maskar and his daughter Olanhar do take students, Maskar demands payment for such services in the form of difficult Art-related quests.

Olanhar Wands: Olanhar (LG female Tethyrian human wizard 14) is a tall, regal woman with long raven tresses and her father-Maskar's distinctive facial features. She is married to Challat Artoban (CG male Tethyrian human wizard 7) and is a close friend of Mhair Szeltune (see page 30) of the Watchful Order of Magists \& Protectors.

Scirkhel Wands: Scirkhel (CG male Tethyrian human ranger 6/bard 2) is a middle-aged, bearded member of the Wands clan, the handsome and well-respected great great nephew of Maskar Wands. Born in the Year of the Fallen Throne (1319 DR), he left at a young age to see the world. During his travels, he fell in with a ranger of the Heralds and learned heraldry and

---

woodcraft from him. After returning to Waterdeep, Scirkhel quietly assumed the duties of Falconfree. He recently took up study as a bard at New Olamn (C72), and he is a close friend of Regnet Amcathra.

### Myrna Cassalanter

Myrna (NE female Tethyrian human bard 1/rogue 7) has a sharp-angled, face-made possible by vigorous self-starvation and delineated by too much cosmetics-and a pale, perfect complexion, enhanced with judicious doses of belladonna. She favors elaborate, revealing gowns accented with gems (and made practical in a northern clime by means of her ring of warmth) and complicated, upswept hairstyles that dramatically show off her henna-colored hair. She has considerable personal wealth, including a small mansion ( $\$ 78$ ), vast wardrobe, a stable with riding and carriage horses, several hawks, and a considerable personal library with books detailing the heraldry, history, and scandals of generations of influential Waterdhavians.

Myrna showed an aptitude for gossip at an early age, falling naturally into the family business of information gathering and rumormongering. One of the best sources of information in upper class Waterdeep, Myrna prides herself on her accu-racy-except when she is paid to spread lies, of course. She is careful to only engage in character assassination when it cannot be traced back to her and damage her reputation. In recent years, Myrna has begun to look for a match that will improve her standings and fortune. Regnet Amcathra spurned her several years ago when he married Galinda Raventree, Myrna's longtime rival, and Myrna continues to exact her revenge in ways both petty and small.

### Rogues and Ruffians

Like all great cities, Waterdeep attracts its fair share of rogues who stalk the shadows and ruffians who prey on the weak. Waterdeep's only recognized thieves' guild, the Shadow Thieves, has been exiled for nearly a century, and the Lords have long sought to confine the city's inevitable illegal pursuits to the Port of Shadow. As a result, most Waterdhavian rogues are independent agents or members of organizations based outside the city. Since the Year of the Wave ( 1364 DR), those who practice bardcraft have been regaining their former prominence in the City of Splendors. Much of this ascendance can be ascribed to the founding of New Olamn (C72).

### Agents of the Eue

The Xanathar, also known as the Eye, is Waterdeep's most powerful and successful beholder. It eliminated every rival eye tyrant in the City of Splendors and the dungeons below, leaving it the unquestioned master of its kind in the City of Splendors. The Eye is served by a large group of agents, known in Undermountain as the Agents of the Eye and in Waterdeep as the Xanathar Thieves' Guild. By either name, the Xanathar's operation controls a large fraction of Waterdeep's slave trade and is rivaled only by the Shadow Thieves in its dominance of petty thieving operations in the City of Splendors.

Base of Operations: The Xanathar Thieves' Guild maintains scattered "safe houses" throughout the sewers of Waterdeep, small rooms hidden behind secret doors among the warrens of passages. In Undermountain, the Agents of the Eye maintain a base in Skullport, the former residence of Misker the Pirate Tyrant, and control much of the Sargauth Level (UM L3).

Agents of the Eye (Expansive Criminal): AL LE, NE, CE; 40,000 gp resource limit; Membership 360; Integrated (humans 133, half-orcs 72, halflings 64, dwarves 36, half-elves 25 , others 18, elves 7 , gnomes 4 , and beholder 1); Dues $60 \mathrm{gp} /$ month ( 300 gp to join).

Authority Figure: The Eye (see below).  
Important Characters: Ahmaergo the "Horned Dwarf" (LE male shield dwarf fighter 9); Avaereene (see below); Shindia Darkeyes (CE half-drow elf rogue 9); Orlpar Husteem (see page 50); Slink Monteskor (CE male Chondathan expert 12); Randulaith of Mirabar (see below); Colstan Rhuul (see below); Ott Steeltoes (NE male shield dwarf rogue 5/fighter 4); Slan Thurbel (CE male Tethyrian fighter 9).

Associated Classes: Expert, fighter, rogue, sorcerer, wizard.  
Associated Skills: Disable Device, Hide, Intimidate, Knowledge (dungeonæering), Knowledge (local), Search.

Requirements: Do not divulge guild secrets to outsiders. You must obtain the guild's consent before attempting any large (a score of $1,000 \mathrm{gp}$ or more) or high-profile crime, and the guild claims $15 \%$ of your profits for such crimes.

Favored in Guild Pringe Benefit: You know the best markets for valuable merchandise. Once per character level, you can sell a magic item for $100 \%$ of its market value, or an art object or gem for $120 \%$ of its normal value.

## Other Noble Houses

Waterdeep is home to over seventy noble families and clans, ranging from fantastically wealthy merchant princes to impoverished but well-bred gentry. Some of the city's more notable noble houses include:

---

Special: The Eye is extremely careful, to the point of paranoia, about bringing new members into its inner circle. You must demonstrate ruthlessness and obedience in a test of loyalty (usually, killing or selling into slavery a former associate or family member).

As the Xanathar Thieves' Guild grows in number, the Eye increasingly hides behind multiple layers of indirection, but even low-level agents of the Xanathar Thieves' Guild are secretly probed by the Eye before becoming members of the guild. Although no one has done so thus far, an agent of the Eye might become an ocular adept ${ }^{59}$, but the Eye would view such individuals as self-aggrandizing, deluded pawns.

Avaereene: Avaereene (LE female Tethyrian wizard 12) is a beautiful, cruel, and skilled mage and slaver who serves the Eye by picking up potential slaves in the seamier wards of Waterdeep by night. She leads the Eye's snatch-and-grab kidnapping agents, known as the Hand. She commands great loyalty from her forces, and they will do anything to prevent her harm or capture. In addition to her quarters in the stronghold of the Eye in Undermountain, she rents rooms in North Ward above the Bent Nail ( $\mathrm{N}^{77}$ ), where she keeps a workbook of spells beneath the floor. She hides an impressive cache of magic items and spellbooks in a cellar off the south end of Carter's Way. Avaereene enjoys creating darkenbeasts ${ }^{\mathrm{MF}}$ to serve her deadly whims, and she intends someday to supplant the Blackstaff as the most powerful mage of Waterdeep.

The Eye: The Eye (LE advanced 33 HD elder orb ${ }^{1,34}$ sorcerer 12), also known the Xanathar, is an ancient, wrinkled, and extremely paranoid beholder of the Graypeaks Hive. Its primary base is in the southern half of the third level of Undermountain near Skullport in a fortified complex, but it also maintains an extensive lair in the sewers of Waterdeep, linked to its other lair by a keyed portal. The elder orb never ventures out from its dual lairs, preferring to work exclusively through intermediaries. It is attended at all times by swarms of lurking stranglers ${ }^{M M 1}$ and eyeball beholderkin ${ }^{M P}$.

The Eye controls an extensive slaving operation in the Port of Shadow, rivaled only by Zatulkk Ssarmn's outfit (see Serpent Kingdoms pages 134 and 142), and the recently resurgent Shadow Thieves. It has also recently muscled in on Skullport's smuggling operations, at the expense of its beholder rival, Misker the Pirate Tyrant (LE advanced 22 HD beholder). In recent  
years, the Eye has extended its control over all the beholders of Undermountain, forcing those who refused to bow to its rule to flee into the Underdark or the surface. It sole remaining rival, Misker, was forced to flee into the depths and is now in hiding in the abandoned Trobriand's Graveyard (UM SLE). The Eye views all humanoids as slaves for the taking, but always interrogates captives to learn all that might be turned to its advantage, slaying only if it must.

Randulaith of Mirabar: Randulaith (NE male Illuskan human wizard 9) guards the Eye's lair in Undermountain, but is a frequent habitué of Skullport and Dock Ward. This quiet, elegant man has a taste for good wine, clever jokes, and mermaids. He favors a plain tunic and breeches. He is not cruel and makes friends easily among beings of all races and alignments, making him a valued spy of the Eye.  
Randulaith has long aspired to join the Lords of Waterdeep, and he has recently made progress toward that goal. He is now the engaged to be married to the widow Brianne Byndraeth (see page 54), having learned from Colstan Thuul of her membership in that august group and then determinedly courted her. In the course of his courtship, he has also caught the eye of Caladorn Cassalanter and Sammereza Sulphontis, both of whom see the charming Randulaith as a possible future Lord, although, thus far, Randulaith has not discovered their secret roles or interest.

Colstan Rhuul: Colstan (LE male Illuskan cleric 11 [Bane]) is a one-time adherent of Bane who briefly adopted Cyric as his god before returning to the Black Lord after his return. This haughty, cold man with thick black hair is a patient, calculating schemer who avoids personal danger whenever he can, preferring to work at a distance through hired knives and behind-thescenes manipulation. He makes a patient, careful, foe for those who injure or thwart him, tirelessly arranging opponent after opponent to bedevil his enemies.

Colstan is Avaereene's second-in-command in the Hand and is based in the Eye's lair in Undermountain. The Banite's favorite tactic is to send hireswords to start a brawl or similar incident with adventurers newly arrived in Waterdeep, while he waits in the wings to steal unguarded belongings in their rooms or

---

attack an isolated spellcaster. The Banite then takes what magic he can, and then calls in the Hand to capture the remaining adventurers. Colstan prides himself on knowing the faces of all important (not always prominent) Waterdhavians, and he has made a hobby of uncovering the identities of the Lords of Waterdeep. After several setbacks in his efforts to discover who is and is not a Lord, Colstan has identified the widow Brianne Byndraeth as a probable member of that group.

### Black Boar Tribe

Named for a barbaric tribe that attacked the City of Splendors nearly three centuries ago, the Black Boar "tribe" is one of two barbaric gangs that prowl Waterdeep's Dock Ward. The Black Boars were founded less than a decade ago by Myrnd Gundwynd, a noble raised by members of the Thunderbeast tribe before returning to Waterdeep as an adult.

The Black Boars provide genuine, reasonably priced security services for merchants and tavernkeepers in Dock Ward, serving as both bodyguards and bouncers for those with coin. The Black Bears are not above initiating the occasional tavern brawl on behalf of a wealthy patron, but they never deliberately target individuals during such altercations, so only those in need of a distraction typically use this "service." Members are fierce rivals of the Bull Elk "tribe."

Base of Operations: The Black Boar tribe has no chapterhouse, but its members can usually be found drinking at the Sleeping Snake (D41).

Black Boar Tribe (Minor Mercenary): AL CN, CG, N; 3,000 gp resource limit; Membership 62; Isolated (humans 59, shield dwarves 2, half-orcs 1); Dues 10 gp per month ( 100 gp to join).

Authority Figure: Myrnd Gundwynd (CN male Illuskan fighter 3/barbarian 9).

Important Characters: Janszobur (see below); Krelth Lionmane (CG male Illuskan human barbarian 3/ranger 3, far wandering member of the Black Lion tribe).

Associated Classes: Barbarian, fighter, rogue, warrior.  
'Associated Skills: Climb, Intimidate, Jump, Knowledge (local), Move Silently, Spot.

Requirements: Do not divulge secrets of the tribe to outsiders. Spend an average of 10 hours per tenday engaged in missions or jobs for the tribe.

Favored in Guild Fringe Benefit: You have learned to overcome pain and weakness in order to impress your fellows. Once per character level you can automatically shake off the effects of being sickened, stunned, or shaken.

Joining the Black Boar tribe usually requires a demonstration of great bravery, such as wrestling a deadly monster in one of the city's illegal fight pits.

Janzobur of the Snow Cats: Janzobur (NG male Illuskan human barbarian 6) is a tall, beardless man with long, braided red hair. He favors pants and a cloak cut from the pelt of a polar bear and a shirt, if worn, of simple linen. Janzobur first came to Waterdeep in the Year of the Prince ( 1357 DR ) in search of a  
warrior-princess for the Red Tiger Uthgardt tribe. His candidate, an Athkatlan mercenary, perished in battle with a remorhaz. By her failure to lead the tribe to glory, Janzobur was also judged a failure, and he returned in disgrace to Waterdeep in search of another candidate. Janzobur now concentrates his efforts on sampling the best brews South Ward's and Dock Ward's taverns have to offer. He has recently fallen in with the Black Boars at the gentle urging of his long-time friend, Myrnd Gundwynd. Janzobur still prefers to brawl rather than draw steel, and his drunken efforts to find his "princess" at the end of every evening (startling sleeping goodwives by peering in their windows and rattling doors down every street he passes) are well known to the City Watch.

### Bull Elk Tribe

Named for a barbaric tribe that set Nimoar's Hold ablaze in the Year of the Shining Shield ( 889 DR ), the Bull Elk "tribe" is one of two barbaric gangs that prowl Waterdeep's Dock Ward. The Bull Elks are composed primarily of outcast Uthgardt barbarians and brutish half-orcs, although a few former Illuskan reavers have joined the tribe as well.

Under the leadership of "Chief" Hagar Hlutwigsson, the Bull Elks offer lucrative "protection services" to most of the taverns along the harbor and many ships while they are unloaded. They are sometimes hired discretely by representatives of the various noble houses to incite tavern brawls in which a certain target is "accidentally" hurt or killed. The thuggish Bull Elks are savvy enough to stay just within the law, keeping one step ahead of the Magisters, the City Watch, and the Guild of Watermen. They are fierce rivals of the Black Bear "tribe."

Base of Operations: The Bull Elk tribe has no chapterhouse, but its members can usually be found drinking at the Bloody Fist (D17).

Bull Elk Tribe (Minor Criminal): AL CE, NE, CN; 3,000 gp resource limit; Membership 83; Mixed (humans 66, half-orcs 17); Dues $40 \mathrm{gp} /$ month ( 100 gp to join).

Authority Figure: "Chief" Hagar "Blue Bear" Hlutwigsson (see below).

Important Characters: "Wormguts" (NE male Illuskan human barbarian 7, banished for murder from the Great Worm tribe); Reskyn the Fanged (CE male half-orc werewolf barbarian 2/ranger 4, abandoned at birth by the Gray Wolf tribe); Ulmrin (see below).

Associated Classes: Barbarian, fighter, rogue, warrior.  
Associated Skills: Climb, Intimidate, Jump, Knowledge (local), Search, Spot.

Requirements: Do not divulge secrets of the tribe to outsiders.

Favored in Guild Fringe Benefit: You have learned exceptional savagery in battle from your bloodthirsty fellows. If you are within 30 feet of another Bull Elk tribesman, you gain a +1 morale bonus on damage rolls.

Special: Joining the Bull Elk tribe usually requires a demonstration of uncontrolled savagery, such as entering a rage or frenzy in combat. In the absence of pure savagery, demonstrable fighting skill (base attack bonus +3 or better) will suffice.

---

Notable Bull Elks include:  
Ulmrin: Ulmrin (LE male half-orc fighter 5) is a rare Waterdhavian half-orc, tolerated so long as his gold is good. This burly fighter can almost pass for human in appearance, and favors the longsword, battleaxe, dagger, and chainmail. He loves to fight, but his loyalty is only to himself. He used to hire on with adventuring bands, but in time his cruelty, self-centeredness, and cowardice became too well known to find steady work. Ulmrin eventually fell in with the Bull Elk tribe, where he has found a comfortable, if brutal, fellowship.

### Chief Hagar Hlutwigsson

The "Blue Bear" is the hagspawn ${ }^{\text {Ure }}$ son of Tanta Hagara, an annis who briefly ruled Hellgate Keep, and Hlutwig Long-throw, last chieftain of the Uthgardt Blue Bear tribe. Banished from the tribe at a young age by his mother, who was serving as shaman at the time, Hagar wandered south and west, surviving through luck, cunning, and his innate hagspawn traits. Over time, he assembled a small band of brutish Uthgardt outcasts and half-orcs, who took to calling him "chief." Eventually the group ended up in Waterdeep's Dock Ward, as much by happenstance as by design.

Although some think him a werebear, the "Blue Bear" became a traditional bear warrior ${ }^{\mathrm{CE}}$ after receiving a vision from Malar of his traditional tribal totem, for Hagar's temperament and methods pleased the Beastlord. Through cunning and brute force, Hagar has since transformed the thugs of the Bull Elk tribe into one of the most powerful gangs in Dock Ward.

Tall and powerfully built, Hagar resembles a brutish human with long arms, big hands, a distinctive hunched posture, and coarse, heavy features. His jet-black hair is long and lank, his red eyes gleam with malice, and his skin color is pallid blue, hinting at his annis ancestry. In bear form, Hagar's fur has a distinctly blue-ish hue, accounting for his moniker as the "Blue Bear."

Hagar Hlutwigsson: Male hagspawn ${ }^{\text {Ure }}$ barbarian 8/bear warrior ${ }^{\text {CE }}$ 9: CR 15; Medium monstrous humanoid; HD 13d12+39; hp 129; Init +1 ; Spd 30 ft . in hide armor (base 40 ft .); AC 20, touch 15, flat-footed 19; Base Atk +13 ; Grp +18 ; Atk +19 melee ( $1 \mathrm{~d} 12+7 / \times 3$, masterwork greataxe); Full Atk $+19 /+14 /+9$ melee ( $1 \mathrm{~d} 12+7 / \times 3$, masterwork greataxe); SA rage 3/day; SQ bear form 2/day, damage reduction $1 /-$, darkvision 60 ft ., fast movement, illiteracy, improved uncanny dodge, scent, spell resistance 24 , trap sense +2 , uncanny dodge; AL CE; SV Fort +13 , Ref +4 , Will +3 ; Str 20, Dex 12, Con 16, Int 8, Wis 10, Cha 11.

Skills and Feats: Climb +13 , Intimidate +16 , Jump +13 , Knowledge (local Waterdeep) +1 , Survival +6 ; Cleave, Extend Rage ${ }^{\mathrm{CE}}$, Instantaneous Rage ${ }^{\mathrm{CE}}$, Power Attack, Track.

Languages: Abyssal, Common, Giant, Illuskan.  
Bear Form (Su): Hagar can transform into a bear (similar to the polymorph spell) while in rage, limited by the number of times per day he enters a rage, and returns to his own form once the rage ends. Hagar retinas the normal +2 bonus on Will saves and -2 penalty to Armor Class while raging, but the ability score bonuses granted by rage are replaced by Strength, Dexterity, and

Constitution bonuses appropriate to the bear form taken (black bear: +8 Str, +2 Dex, +4 Con; brown bear: $+16 \mathrm{Str},+2$ Dex, +8 Con). As normal for polymorph, Hagar gains the bear form's physical qualities (including size, movement, natural armor bonus, natural weapons, space, and reach), as well as any extraordinary special attacks possessed by the form (such as improved grab in the brown bear form). The transformation lasts for the duration of the rage.

Unlike with the polymorph spell, Hagar doesn't gain the bear's Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores when he takes bear form, nor does he regain any hit points when he transforms. However, his current hit points increase due to his new Constitution, as normal for the rage ability.

Improved Uncanny Dodge  
(Ex): Cannot be flanked and can only be sneak attacked by

Chief Hagar Hlutwigsson, the "Blue Bear" a character who has at least 12 levels of rogue.  
Rage (Ex): Three times per day, Hagar can enter a state of fierce rage that lasts for 8 rounds. The following changes are in effect as long as he rages: hp 155; AC 18, touch 13, flat-footed 17; Grp +20 ; Atk +21 melee ( $1 \mathrm{~d} 12+10 / \times 3$, masterwork greataxe); Full Atk $+21 /+16 /+11$ melee ( $1 \mathrm{~d} 12+10 / \times 3$, masterwork greataxe); SV Fort +15 , Will +5 ; Str 24, Con 20; Climb +15 , Jump +15 . At the end of his rage, Hagar is fatigued for the duration of the encounter.

Scent (Ex): Hagar has the scent special ability while in bear or nonbear form.

Uncanny Dodge (Ex): Hagar retains his Dexterity bonus to Armor Class even when flat-footed or targeted by an unseen foe (he still loses his Dexterity bonus if paralyzed or otherwise immobile).

Possessions: Blue dragonhide armor, Ellatharion's ring (ring of protection +4 ), masterwork greataxe, heart of the beast ${ }^{\text {ring }}$, potion of protection from arrows ( $10 /$ magic).

### The Shadow Thieves

Founded over a century ago in the City of Splendors, the Shadow Thieves ${ }^{\mathrm{LD}}$ were eventually unmasked and nearly destroyed by the Lords of Waterdeep. After the guild was banished from the City of Splendors, the survivors regrouped in Amn. The guild has since grown to be the largest and most prosperous thieves' guild in all Faerûn, controlling the lion's share of all criminal operations along the Sword Coast (with the notable exception of Waterdeep), and elsewhere in the Realms as well.

The Shadow Thieves have long schemed to reestablish themselves in the City of Splendors. Constant vigilance by the Lords of Waterdeep and their agents kept the guild at bay until recently, but the dark times that have fallen on Waterdeep in the past two decades have given the Shadow Thieves an opening they have been quick to exploit. For more than five years, the guild has been funneling manpower and resources into the City of Splendors-and results are beginning to show. The guild has slowly come to dominate criminal activity in Dock, South, and Trades Ward, and its fingers are reaching into the northern wards of the city as well.

The Waterdeep sect is led by Silhouette of Shadows Alauneth "the Black Viper" Orrane. She reports to Marune "the Masked," Cloakmaster of the Dessarin, who is in the city often enough to be considered the true head of the sect. Marune, in turn, reports to the Shade of Baldur's Gate and thereby the entire Shadow Council.

Early in the Year of the Tankard ( 1370 DR), Marune finally unveiled his grand plan for giving the Shadow Thieves an unassailable edge over the Lords of Waterdeep. The necromancer began distributing slippers of shadowwalking ${ }^{6}$ to the guild's highest-ranking thieves. Agents of the Shadow Thieves can now effortlessly navigate Waterdeep's shadows, beyond the reach of the city's Lords. Marune intends to continue this work until the entire city falls under the sway of the guild..

Base of Operations: Before their banishment, the Shadow Thieves were based in the Citadel of Bloody Shadows in the heart of Mount Waterdeep. Today, the reborn guild is based in a half-dozen safe houses scattered through Dock Ward, Southern Ward, and Trades Ward. (A sample safe house is detailed in Lords of Darkness.)

The Shadow Thieves have struck a bargain with the Shadovar of the City of Shade, in which select members of the guild are transformed into shades. In exchange, the Shadow Thieves spy on Waterdeep and the Sword Coast on the behalf of the princes of Shade.

Shadow Thieves of Waterdeep (Standard Criminal): AL LE, NE, CE, CN; 40,000 gp resource limit; Membership 164 (local); Mixed (humans 130, halflings 15, elves 8, dwarves 5, gnomes 3, half-elves 2, half-orcs 1); Dues 70 gp/month ( 300 gp to join).

Authority Figures: The Shadow Council of Athkatla (specifically the Shade of Baldur's Gate); "The Masked" (Marune, Cloakmaster of the Dessarin; see below); Alauneth "the Black Viper" Orrane (see below).

Important Characters: Androm Kherr (NE male Illuskan human fighter 6, Ruathymite sea captain); Balthorr "the Bold"

Olaskos (see page 50); Maknis (LE male Illuskan human commoner 4, shipping agent); Ressic Ophal (LE male Tethyrian human rogue 5 /shadow thief of Amn ${ }^{\text {PG }} 4$, spice merchant of Amn); Reoke Segymn (CE male Illuskan human expert 3, merchant); Yladhra the Grim (CE female Calishite human diviner 12, exile from Myratma).

Associated Classes: Expert, fighter, rogue.  
Associated Skills: Bluff, Disguise, Gather Information, Hide, Knowledge (local), Sleight of Hand.

Requirements: You may not divulge secrets of the guild to outsiders. You must gain the consent of your superiors before attempting any particularly large ( $1,000 \mathrm{gp}$ or more) or highprofile crime, and the guild is entitled to a $20 \%$ cut of your profits for such jobs.

Favored in Guild Fringe Benefit: Mask favors thieves who are bold and quick. Once per character level, you can call upon Mask's blessing to gain a +4 dodge bonus to AC for a duration of 1 minute.

Special: Joining the Shadow Thieves requires a demonstration of cunning and effectiveness (usually the acquisition of a valuable trinket that is to be given to the guild in tribute, or the heart of an assassinated enemy of the guild) and a blood-oath to the Shadow Council's designated representative.

Members of the Shadow Thieves can take the Shadow Thief of Amn ${ }^{\mathrm{PG}}$ prestige class, if admitted to the guild and they meet all requirements.

Marune the Masked: The oldest living member of the Shadow Thieves is the necromancer Marune (NE male Tethyrian human necromancer 5/shadow adept ${ }^{\mathrm{PG}} 14 /$ archmage 5 ), who was born in the Year of the Black Buck (1226 DR). Marune achieved longevity through magic without resorting to liçhdom, thanks to the artifact known as Andrathath's mask, which he acquired early in his career while plundering a long-forgotten ruined tower in the Lost Peaks.

Marune helped found the Shadow Thieves in the Year of the Raging Flame ( 1255 DR), and served as Shadowmage of the Guild until their defeat and exile in the Year of the Pointed Bone (1298 DR). In the Year of the Behir (1342 DR), Marune sold his holdings in Luskan and Mirabar and vanished. Unbeknownst to his allies and foes alike, he had acquired the Book of Vauth and wanted to study it in isolation. Marune constructed a secret lair amid the roots of Mount Helimbrar and then vanished within.

In the Year of the Gauntlet (1369 DR), Marune emerged to reclaim his old position within the hierarchy of the Shadow Thieves. He is now the Cloakmaster of the Dessarin, nominally reporting to the Shade of Baldur's Gate. In truth, the Shade Council gives him almost complete autonomy. Marune accepts whatever changes occur within the guild with a shrug, determined only that the guild will survive.

Despite his reputation, Marune is rather nondescript in appearance. He is of middling height, with an average face, a mid-length gray beard, and a plump belly. Traditionally, Marune has favored the classic garb of a necromancer, including long black robes and a somewhat pointy hat. However, during visits to Waterdeep, the Cloakmaster of the Dessarin shields his identity with Andrathath's mask. Marune is consumed with his hatred

---

for the Lords of Waterdeep and the members of the Arunsun clan. He is cruel, ruthless, and vengeful to a fault.

Marune is attended by six will-o-wisps who serve him voluntarily.

### Alauneth "Black Viper" Orrane

Born in the village of Amphail in the Year of the Lion (1340 DR), the Black Viper of Undermountain is one of Waterdeep's most infamous thieves. Alauneth has short, hacked-off black hair, a fiery temper, and a deep, husky voice given to nigh-constant swearing. Her beautiful face is marred only by a ragged scar that runs down the left side of her chin and ends on her shoulder.

In the past, the Black Viper favored daring snatch-and-grab thefts accompanied by clouds of smoke (obscuring mist) from rich merchants and nobles, but in recent years, she has grown bored of such games. After allying herself with agents of the Shadow Thieves almost a decade ago, she quickly became enmeshed in guild activities and rose to a position of leadership within the Waterdeep sect of the guild, second only to the Masked (Marune). Her responsibilities as Silhouette of Shadows include recruiting new talent, surreptitiously establishing safe houses for the guild within the City of Splendors, and eliminating threats to the guild's activities. She employs her thieving prowess to acquire materials with which to blackmail rich merchants into being her purchasing agents.

The first set of statistics that follow describes Alauneth if she is encountered in darkness (when she is more formidable); the second set describes her if she is encountered in a location that has bright illumination.

Languages: Chondathan, Common, Illuskan.  
Death Attack (Ex): If Alauneth studies her victim for 3 rounds and then makes a sneak attack with a melee weapon that successfully deals damage, the sneak attack has the additional effect of possibly either paralyzing or killing the target

---

(Alauneth's choice). If the victim of such an attack fails a DC 16 Fortitude save, she is paralyzed for $1 \mathrm{~d} 6+5$ rounds or killed, as appropriate.

Poison Use: Alauneth is skilled in the use of poison and never risks accidentally poisoning herself when applying poison to a weapon.

Control Light (Sp): Alauneth can decrease the levels of light within a $100_{2}$ foot radius of herself by a factor of up to $100 \%$. This decreases the overall effective range of vision for characters and creatures dependent on light by the same percentage. Creatures within the affected area gain a +1 bonus on Hide checks for each $25 \%$ decrease in light. Alauneth cannot use this ability in bright light.

Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): Cannot be flanked and can only be sneak attacked by a character who has at least nineteen levels of rogue.

Invisibility (Sp): Alauneth can use this spell-like ability once per minute as a 15 th-level sorcerer. She cannot use this spell-like ability when in bright light.

Shadesight (Su): Alauneth has darkvision out to 60 feet. She can see normally through any darkness effects, but not through fog, invisibility, obscurement, and so forth. She cannot use this ability when in bright light.

Shadow Image (Sp): Three times per day, Alauneth can use this ability (similar to the mirror image spell) as a 15 th-level sorcerer. The ability creates $1 \mathrm{~d} 4+5$ figments. She cannot use this ability when in bright light.

Shadow Stride (Su): Alauneth can vanish from her current location and reappear in any shadowy area within 100 feet, as often as once every 2 rounds. Using this ability is a move action, so Alauneth can use another ability, cast a spell, or attack in the same round. She cannot use this ability when in bright light.

Shadow Travel (Sp): Once per day, Alauneth can use either greater teleport to reach a shadowy locale on the same world as the shade or plane shift to access the Plane of Shadow. Alauneth must be in shadows to use this ability.

Sneak Attack (Ex): Alauneth does an extra 9d6 points of damage on any successful attack against flat-footed or flanked targets, or against a target that has been denied its Dexterity bonus for any reason. This damage also applies to ranged attacks against targets up to 30 feet away. Creatures with concealment, creatures without discernible anatomies, and creatures immune to extra damage from critical hits are all immune to sneak attacks. Alauneth can choose to deliver nonlethal damage with her sneak attack, but only when using a weapon designed for that purpose, such as a sap (blackjack).

Trapfinding (Ex): Alauneth can find, disarm, or bypass traps with a DC of 20 or higher. She can use the Search skill to find, and the Disable Device skill to disarm, magic traps (DC $25+$ the level of the spell used to create it). If her Disable Device result exceeds the trap's DC by 10 or more, she discovers how to bypass the trap without triggering or disarming it.

*New item described in Chapter 7.

### Independent Agents

Since the exile of the Shadow Thieves, the Lords of Waterdeep have fought to keep organized thieves' guilds out of the City of Splendors. In their absence, individual agents have flourished, free to pursue their own aims and keep their ill-gotten gains for themselves. Some of the more notable independent agents include:

Thear Chessar: Thear (CN female shield dwarf rogue 5/thiefacrobat ${ }^{\mathrm{CA}} 3$, Dungeoneer's Intuition ${ }^{\circ}$ feat) is a short, bearded dwarf of Clan Stoneshaft who loves the fun and danger of stealing from rooftops. With her trusty battleaxe and old chain shirt, no one suspects she is a thief. She simply leaves them behind in the shadows of a rooftop when she's in the building beneath, leaving her free to practice her craft. If chased, Thear proves an elusive foe, doubling back over sewers and rooftops until she can don armor and axe and become a "typical" dwarf drinking in a busy tavern. Thear resists greedy impulses to over-indulge in thievery, usually picks on visitors to the city, and is quite talented. In recent years, Thear has become quite close with Paerro (see below), and the two have become firm drinking and thieving buddies.

Elaith "the Serpent" Craulnober: Elaith is fully detailed on page 182 of the Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting.

Duromil "the Fearless": Duromil (CN male Tethyrian human rogue 8) appears to be an average fighter, down on his luck, with stringy chestnut hair, wispy moustache and beard, and ill-kept equipment. In truth, Duromil is a quiet, close-mouthed thief who specializes in robbing visitors to the city of small precious items. He frequents Castle Ward's inns and taverns, posing as a fighter and even hiring on with Blazidon if times are particularly lean. He is not averse to accompanying an adventuring band as a hiresword and later stealing from them when opportunities arise, but he is always careful to hide the fact that he is a thief.

His favorite tricks are sneak attacks and picking pockets in the dark when an adventuring band is confused and split up by an engagement with another foe, and then "appearing" on the scene as a loyal, troubled comrade. Duromil never attempts this scam when there is even the slightest chance of failure, and no one in Waterdeep suspects his true nature, a tribute to his success.

Paerro: Paerro (CN male rock gnome rogue 6/thief-acrobat ${ }^{\mathrm{CA}}$ 2), whose real name is Taslythor Rocktapper, of the Rocktappers of the Earthfasts, emigrated from the backlands of Impiltur nearly two decades ago. When he first arrived in Waterdeep, he was at loss for what to do, but he eventually found he could make a reasonable living as a pickpocket in Waterdeep's busy

---

taverns. That lasted for several years, with Paerro making an increasing number of trips before Waterdeep's magisters, until Thear Chessar took pity on him and began teaching him the art of being a cat burglar. It has now been so long since Paerro has been caught that the Watch thinks he has left town, and Paerro and Thear have become fast friends, drinking and thieving together for fun and sport.

Juz'la: Juz'la (CE tainted one ${ }^{\text {MP }}$ (yuan-ti) rogue 3 /sorcerer 8) is a native of Skullport, born in the Port of Shadow. In her youth, she survived as a spy, selling secrets to the highest bidder. After crossing the slaver Zstulkk Ssarmn (see Serpent Kingdoms pages 134 and 142), she was captured, trained in sorcery, and transformed into a tainted one. Juz'la served Zstulkk as a spy among the followers of Cyric before undergoing a devout religious conversion to the Dark Sun's faith. She then became a double agent for a time before the slaver discovered her treachery. Juz'la fled to the surface, where she now makes a living as a minor spy lord in Waterdeep in the employ of various guilds and merchants.

### Zabbas Thuul

Zabbas Thuul wears his oily black hair pulled back in a ponytail, and his face always shines with sweat and oil. He keeps a low profile in Waterdeep, posing as a sycophantic wizard of minor powers willing to tutor, sell scrolls, or adventure for the right price. He is an unprincipled thief, willing to steal from anyone, including his own adventuring companions. He is adept at arranging alibis; his favorite is to get himself jailed by the Watch for "drunken" revelry, then slip out of his cell with magic to make a theft, stash the loot, and return before his absence is noted.

Zabbas is a frequent habitué of Skullport as well, earning lucrative fees running messages and acting as a slave-ship booking agent. He has long worked with the slavers of the Iron Ring, and he is quickly becoming a relatively trusted agent of Consul Orgin Ulmokina of the Thayan enclave in Skullport. Curiously, Elaith Craulnober's honorable streak has actually opened doors for Waterdeep's "other rogue elf," despite the fact he in no way deserves such a chance. Zabbas rents rooms at the Blushing Nymph (C81) festhall in Waterdeep and the Burning Troll inn in Skullport.

Zabbas Thuul: Male moon elf rogue 3/wizard 5/ Arcane Trickster 4: CR 12; Medium humanoid; HD 3d6 plus 9d4; hp 35; Init +4; Spd 30 ft.; AC 21, touch 14, flat-footed 17; Base Atk +6 ; Grp +7 ; Atk +11 melee ( $1 \mathrm{~d} 6+2 / 18-20,+1$ rapier) or +11 ranged ( $1 \mathrm{~d} 4+2 / 19-20,+1$ returning dagger); Full Atk $+9 /+4$ melee ( $1 \mathrm{~d} 6+2 / 18-20,+1$ rapier) and +9 melee ( $1 \mathrm{~d} 4+1 / 19-20$, +1 returning dagger); SA Impromptu sneak attack 1/day, sneak attack +4 d 6 ; SQ Evasion, ranged legerdemain 1/day, trapfinding, trap sense +1 ; AL NE; SV Fort +3 , Ref +12 , Will +9 ; Str 13, Dex 19, Con 10, Int 17, Wis 10, Cha 8.

Search +16 , Sense Motive +5 , Sleight of Hand +10 , Spellcraft +5 , Spot +4 , Survival +0 ( +2 following tracks), Tumble +7 , Use Rope +4 ( +6 bindings); Scribe Scroll ${ }^{8}$, Silent Spell ${ }^{8}$, Smooth Talk ${ }^{\mathrm{PLI}}$, Still Spell, Two Weapon Defense, Two Weapon Fighting, Weapon Finesse.

Languages: Chondathan, Common, Elven, Illuskan.  
Evasion (Ex): If Zabbas is exposed to any effect that normally allows him to attempt a Reflex saving throw for half damage, he takes no damage with a successful saving throw.

Impromptu Sneak Attack: Once per day, Zabbas can declare one melee or ranged attack he makes to be a sneak attack (the target can be no more than 30 feet distant if the impromptu sneak attack is a ranged attack). The target of an impromptu sneak attack loses any Dexterity bonus to AC, but only against that attack. The power can be used against any target, but creatures that are not subject to critical hits take no extra damage (though they still lose any Dexterity bonus to AC against the attack).

Ranged Legerdemain: Using his unique talents, Zabbas can perform one of the following skills at a range of 30 feet: Disable Device, Open Lock, or Sleight of Hand. Working at a distance increases the normal skill check DC by 5 , and Zabbas cannot take 10 on this check. Any object to be manipulated must weigh 5 pounds or less. Zabbas can make only one ranged legerdemain skill check each day.

Sneak Attack (Ex): Zabbas does 4 d 6 extra points of damage on any successful attack against flat-footed or flanked targets, or against a target that has been denied its Dexterity bonus for any reason. This damage also applies to ranged attacks against targets up to 30 feet away. Creatures with concealment, creatures without discernible anatomies, and creatures immune to extra damage from critical hits are all immune to sneak attacks. Zabbas can choose to deliver nonlethal damage with his sneak attack, but only when using a weapon designed for that purpose, such as a sap (blackjack).

Trapfinding (Ex): Zabbas can find, disarm, or bypass traps with a DC of 20 or higher. He can use the Search skill to find, and the Disable Device skill to disarm, magic traps (DC 25 + the level of the spell used to create it). If his Disable Device result exceeds the trap's DC by 10 or more, he discovers how to bypass the trap without triggering or disarming it.

Wizard Spells Prepared (caster level 9th): 0-detect magic, ghost sound (DC 13), prestidigitation, read magic; 1st-detect secret doors, disguise self, hold portal, true strike, ventriloquism (DC 14); 2nd-detect thoughts, knock, locate object, spider climb, web (DC 15); 3rd-arcane sight, dispel magic, nondetection, suggestion (DC 16); 4th-arcane eye, stoneskin; 5th-passwall.

Spellbook: Zabbas knows all of the abjuration, conjuration, divination, enchantment, illusion, and necromancy, wizard spells in the Player's Handbook and many of the permitted wizard spells in the Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting, Magic of Faerûn, and Player's Guide to Faerûn.

Possessions: +2 slick mithral shirt, +1 rapier, dagger of homing ( +1 returning dagger), headband of intellect +2 , goggles of minute seeing.

### Sages and Loremasters

As the gateway to the North and the center of trade along the northern Sword Coast, one of Waterdeep's most important markets is the sale and spread of information, knowledge, and lore (true or otherwise). However, unlike many other professions, Waterdeep does not have a guild of sages.

Irbryth Authamaun: Irbryth (CG male Chondathan expert 6) is a sage knowledgeable about such diverse areas as Knowledge (local Waterdeep), specializing in the minutiae of Waterdeep's broadsheets, and Knowledge (history), specializing in the history of Waterdeep. He can be contacted at his home (N62).

Ilighast Chamnabbar: Ilighast (NG male Illuskan wizard 5) is well-educated in Knowledge (arcana), specializing in magic traditions, Knowledge (the planes), specializing in the Astral Plane, the Ethereal Plane, and the Elemental Planes, and Knowledge (history), specializing in the histories of dwarves, elves, gnomes, and halflings along the Sword Coast and across the North. This short, bitter little man is a member of the Watchful Order, and he spends much of his time hoping to hear some useful information at the Tower of the Order (C15). He is incredibly terse, leading some to complain he charges by the word.

Narthund Delzhour: Narthund (LG male expert 5) studies the fields of Knowledge (arcana), specializing in astrology, astronomy, and numerology, and Knowledge (geography), specializing in geology and mineralogy. Always found in a tavern, Narthund is very cheap, charging half his fees in ale, but only coherent in the early hours of the evening. His favorite tavern is the Elfstone Tavern (C32).

Jasmal: Jasmal (N female shield dwarf cleric 5 [Dumathoin]) is known for her research in Knowledge (architecture and engineering), specializing in stonecraft and weaponry, Knowledge (history), specializing in dwarfkind, and Knowledge (nature), specializing in fauna of the Sword Coast and the North. She has a light beard and ready smile, unless lied to. She is only found in Waterdeep in the winter months; the rest of the year, she wanders the North looking for relics of Delzoün and observing the local wildlife. When in the city, she takes lodging in the Warrens under Dock Ward but is often found at Selüne's Smile (D6).

Vlorn Keenear: Vlorn (N male lightfoot halfling expert 10) is a sage known for his studies of Knowledge (history), specializing in the folklore, history, languages, legends, and politics of halflingkind, and the politics and history of humankind along the Sword Coast, and Knowledge (religion), specializing in the mythology of halflingkind. Vlorn's sarcastic, joking demeanor leaves many clients wondering just how accurate his information is, but he is invariably correct. Vlorn has a keen and discerning eye for the intrigues of Waterdeep's nobility, and his grasp of Waterdeep's intricate politics is near perfect. Vlorn lives amid the Warrens of Dock Ward, but he is often found at the Grinning Lion (N56).

Blackrabbas Khuulthund: Blackrabbas (CN male Tethyrian human expert 7) is a sage knowledgeable about such diverse areas as Knowledge (nature), specializing in the fauna (birds, insects) and flora (flowers, herbs) of the Sword Coast and the

North. Although quite knowledgeable, Blackrabbas is a pompous windbag given to touting his own horn, which has undermined his reputation in recent years and forced him to lower his fees. Blackrabbas is a habitual visitor to the Font of Knowledge (C4) and keeps a room in a nearby row house.

Javroun Lithkind: Javroun (NE male Chondathan human expert 9) is very knowledgeable of such fields as Knowledge (geography), Knowledge (history), specializing in the history and politics of humankind, and Knowledge (nobility and royalty), specializing in the genealogy of humankind. Javroun is a spiteful, bitter man who consults only to prove his superiority over his clients after making them wait through interminable pauses in which he stares silently through his client while twisting his moustache. Javroun is a regular at the Font of Knowledge (C4) and keeps a room in a nearby row house.

Haerun Mhammaster: Haerun (CN male Tethyrian human expert 12) is a scholar whose studies include Knowledge (history), specializing in the art, folklore, legends, and music of elves, dwarves, halflings, and gnomes, and Knowledge (architecture and engineering), specializing in dungeons and other underground construction. This shriveled, hunchbacked old man never leaves his library. He never solicits clients, but his friends at the Elfstone Tavern (C32) direct honest-looking clients to his row house (C82) nearby.

Kromnlor Sernar: Kromnlor (CN female Chondathan human expert 8) is knowledgeable about such diverse areas as Healing and Knowledge (nature), specializing in flora (fungi, herbs) of the Sword Coast, the North, and the Heartlands. Born in Sespech, Kromnlor is a wandering midwife who helps the indigent of Dock Ward with her folk remedies and often clashes with members of the Guild of Apothecaries \& Physicians, who disagree with her undoubtedly effective methods. Kromnlor rooms at Warm Beds (D15), but is rarely there except early in the morning and late at night.

Mirrormul Tszul: Mirrormul (CG male Tethyrian human expert 7) is well read in Knowledge (nature), specializing in the biology of humanoids and giantkind. He also speaks many humanoid and giant languages and can ably Decipher Script. This excitable, nervous man is prone to inappropriate giggling and quick speech. He is usually found at the Shrines of Nature (35), lending aid to the clergy of Silvanus.

Sulphon: Sulphon (N male Illuskan human expert 8) is a sage knowledgeable about Knowledge (arcana), specializing in the study of magical beasts, and Knowledge (dungeoneering), specializing in the study of aberrations. Sulphon is a quiet, studious man who would prefer to read one hundred books rather than talk to another individual. He can usually be found among the stacks at the Font of Knowledge (C4).

### Secret Societies

Waterdeep attracts the interest of various secret societies the same way honey attracts the interest of flies. As the chief bastion of civilization, commerce, and military power on the northern Sword Coast, Waterdeep's dealings affect people for a thousand miles around.

---

### The Harpers

Those Who Harp believe in the power of individuals, the balance between the wilderness and civilization, and the good of humankind and its allies. Harpers have played a powerful part in guiding Waterdeep's energies toward commerce, not conquest. Despite the group's longstanding ties to the City of Splendors, the recent formation of the Tel Teukiira has undercut Harper activities in Waterdeep and divided the loyalties of many Harper agents, friends, and allies.

Although the number of Harpers based in Waterdeep has always been small, each has a score of individual contacts, Harper friends, and secret allies. In addition, many Harpers regularly pass through the City of Splendors, effectively doubling or tripling the number of active Harpers in the city at any given time.

Base of Operations: Although individual Harpers and Harper friends have innumerable contact points, the group does not have a permanent home in Waterdeep itself, aside from Harpers' Hold. This secret section of the Citadel of the Bloody Hand (see page 116), hidden beneath the western flanks of Mount Waterdeep, is now warded against entry by Khelben or Laeral.

Harpers of Waterdeep (Minor Special): AL NG, CG, LG; 40,000 gp resource limit; Membership 121 (local, including allies); Integrated (humans 45, halflings 24, elves 22, dwarves 12, gnomes 9 , half-elves 6 , half-orcs 3 ); Dues none.

Authority Figure: Eather Heilean (see below). In addition, Khelben and Laeral still command a great deal of respect from many rank-and-file Harpers.

Important Characters: Alice Tinker (see below); Bensyl Iyrivvin (CN female half-moon elf wizard 4/rogue 1/Harper agent ${ }^{\text {PG }}$ 2, lady escort at the Blushing Mermaid [D36]); Bronwyn Caradoon (see below); Jhandess Millomyr (CG female Tethyrian human bard 7/Harper agent ${ }^{\text {PG }} 3$, harpmaker and owner of Millomyr Harps [N70]); Nleera Tarannath Tesper (CG female Illuskan human wizard 7/rogue 1/Harper agent ${ }^{\text {PG }}$ 5); Tantuss Shieldsun (see below); Vedellen Hawkhand (NG male half-sun elf ranger 11).

Important Harper Friends: Coril (see below); Tioch (LN male Tethyrian human fighter 4, "blind beggar" who can magically see Harper pins ${ }^{\text {M46 }}$ in full moonlight); and the "Defenders Three": Amstor "the Grim" (LG male lightfoot halfling cleric 7 [Arvoreen]), Asohs "the Daring" (CG male lightfoot halfling male rogue 6), and Pithar "the Bold" (CG male lightfoot halfling fighter 5), who run the Holyhands House (N16).

Associated Classes: Any.  
Associated Skills: Concentration, Diplomacy, Gather Information, Knowledge (arcana), Listen, Perform, Spellcraft.

Requirements: None.  
Pringe Benefits: The Harpers count many skilled magical artisans among their friends. Once per character level you can purchase a single magic item of $50,000 \mathrm{gp}$ or less for $75 \%$ of its normal market price.

Special: Joining the Harpers requires sponsorship by a member in good standing of Those Who Harp and approval from the High Harpers.

Members of the Harpers can take the Harper agent ${ }^{\text {PG }}$ or Harper paragon ${ }^{\text {PG }}$ prestige class, if approved by the High Harpers and they meet all requirements.

Coril of Baldur's Gate: Coril (CG fe-"male" Tethyrian human wizard 8) is always seen wearing heavy, black robes and carrying a heavy, metal-bound book under one arm. She seems to be a handsome, clean-shaven young man, with close-cropped, straight brown hair and eyes of sparkling lime green hue, but in truth, she is a woman. Quiet to a fault, Coril is often found in the corners of Waterdeep's taprooms, simply observing the goings-on and making copious notes and sketches. Her tome is a collection of loose papers on which she writes awful verse as well as coded bits of information for the Harpers.

Coril keeps her spellbooks hidden in a cavity behind a loose stone in a roof minaret atop Mariners' Hall (D44). Coril is the illegitimate daughter of the wealthy mercenary lord Sarraver of Baldur's Gate, who has recently rediscovered her whereabouts. She is loathe to move from Waterdeep to escape his unwanted attentions, so she is forced to reject the increasingly frequent efforts of Sarraver's servants to bring her back to Baldur's Gate and marry her off.

Eather Heilean: Born in the Year of the Wandering Maiden (1337 DR), Eather (LG female Illuskan human paladin 7/Harper paragon ${ }^{\text {PG }} 10$ of Milil, Poe Hunter ${ }^{\text {PG }}$ feat) wandered the North as a child until the age of twelve, when her parents placed her in fosterage at Evensong Tower in Berdusk. She joined the Harpers at a young age and recently achieved the rank of High Harper with the backing of Bran Skorlsun and Belhuar Thantarth.

In the Year of the Unstrung Harp (1371 DR), in a deliberate rebuke to Khelben, the leaders of Twilight Hall dispatched Eather to Waterdeep to restore "order" to the Harper ranks in Waterdeep. Since her arrival, Eather has begun purging the ranks of those who continue to aid and abet the Tel Teukiira or who challenge the directives of the High Harpers in Berdusk. Eather has also stepped up efforts to recruit new Harpers who are loyal first and foremost to Twilight Hall, many of them recent graduates of New Olamn (C72). Although the change is gradual, under Eather's direction the Harpers of Waterdeep have begun to work more openly and align themselves with the churches of Milil, Oghma, Sune, and Tymora, largely distancing themselves from Blackstaff Tower and the Tel Teukiira.

Tantuss Shieldsun: Tantuss (NG male Illuskan ranger 10 [Mielikki]) is tall, broad-shouldered, and barrel-chested, with a black hair and a bushy beard. Almost comically shy around women (particularly the priestesses of the Shrines of Nature), he is constantly bowing his head in devout prayer to prevent any from seeing him bluish. Tantuss makes his living as an adventurer, guiding and defending caravans across the North and hiring himself out to adventuring bands (although he will not enter tombs or private homes without just cause). As a Harper, he often carries messages from the Lady's Hands to other servants of the Lady of the Forest across the North. He also tutors rangers for small fees, donating that which he does not need to live to the church.

Alice Tinker: Alice (NG female rock gnome fighter 4/ rogue 1/Harper agent ${ }^{\text {PG }}$ 1) works in the Curious Past (C85) as

---

Bronwyn's assistant. Skilled at drawing and appraising, she is also an agent of the Harpers, active in aiding the adventures and aspirations of Waterdeep's halfling and gnome communities. Alice's presence has made the Curious Past a popular but clandestine meeting place for halflings and gnomes embroiled in the latest intrigues.

Bronwyn Caradoon: Born in the Year of Moonfall (1344 DR) to Hrogrulf and Gwenindale Caradoon, Bronwyn (NG female Illuskan human rogue 5/Harper agent ${ }^{20} 4$ ) is small and slim, with an athletic build, long-brown hair pulled back in a single braid, and large brown eyes. Captured by Zhentarim slavers as a child, she grew up in Amn and became an adept counterfeiter of jewelry and coins. After purchasing her freedom, she became an antiquities dealer. Recruited to the Harpers, she moved to Waterdeep, where she divides her time between tending her shop, the Curious Past (C85), and adventuring in search of new treasures.

Bronwyn can provide information and lore on little-known treasures, translation of ancient texts and inscriptions, or discrete introductions to "collectors" who operate somewhat left of the law. She also "hears things," so adventurers hired to locate lost or stolen objects would do well to check with her. Dandies, socialites, and others who possess an excess of coin will her find her shop a rich trove of unusual jewelry and curiosities. As a member of Those Who Harp, Bronwyn carries messages and gives aid to Harpers passing through Waterdeep.

As a descendant of the legendary Samular, Bronwyn has acquired several unusual familial legacies. She holds one of the three rings of Samular, and she has returned one to the Knights of Samular. She also holds title to the keep known as Thornhold. Her estranged brother is Dag Zoreth (born Brandon Caradoon) of Darkhold (CE male Illuskan human cleric 5/strifeleader ${ }^{29} 5$ [Cyric], Trickery domain), and she is raising his young daughter, Cara, who owns the third ring.

Bronwyn is not on good terms with the Knights of Samular, particularly Algorind of Tyr or Sir Gareth Cormaeril, or the Zhentarim, including her brother and his mentor, Malchior of Darkhold (see page 38). Through her friend Ebeneezer Stoneshaft (CN male shield dwarf fighter 7/rogue 7), Bronwyn is closely allied with the shield dwarves of Clan Stoneshaft and allows them to occupy Thornhold as their clanhold.

### The Knights of the Shield

The Knights of the Shield purport to be a consortium of merchants and nobles interested in manipulating political and mercantile activity for their own economic gain, but, in truth, their influence stems from their ability to acquire, manipulate, and wield information. Based primarily in Amn, Tethyr, and Baldur's Gate, their influence extends from Calimshan and the Shining Sea to Waterdeep. The Knights hold some notoriety in the North, for rumors place a disguised evil being from the lower planes at the head of this group.

The Knights have kept a low profile in Waterdeep for the past decade, after a disastrous attempt to overthrow the Lords resulted in the organization being largely driven from the City of Splendors.

Bly Ruldegost: The only Knight of any prominence to reside in the city is Lord Bly Ruldegost (LN male Illuskan human fighter 8), a proud and honorable man and the regent of House Ruldegost. Lord Bly has little interest in overthrowing the Lords or placing a Knight among their number, and he has blocked all suggestions to do one or the other. Lord Bly continues his efforts to recruit other Waterdhavian nobles to the knighthood, but so far without success, thanks to the quiet whispers of the various Lords of Waterdeep.

Mather Ukkhemn: Mather (CE male Tethyrian commoner 5) is a fat, egotistical Tethyrian merchant who moonlights as a slaver and visits Waterdeep on occasion for business. Having earned the ire of Durnan after staying at the Yawning Portal (C48) with a pair of slaves, Mather must now keep a very low profile on return visits. Mather is a strong advocate of placing a member of the order among the Lords of Waterdeep, and Lord Inselm Hhune of Tethyr recently entrusted to him the identity of a suspected Lord of Waterdeep. After being firmly rejected by Lord Bly Ruldegost in any attempt to replace Nindil Jalbuck with a member of the Knights, Mather revealed Nindil's identity as a Lord of Waterdeep to the Unseen for a tidy sum of money. (See page 54 for more information on Nindil Jalbuck, and page 57 for more details on the Unseen.) Mather is now terrified that Lord Hhune or Lord Bly will discover his treachery and hold him accountable.

### The Kraken Society

The Kraken Society is a shadowy group active in the North and the islands of the Trackless Sea. They have a well-deserved reputation in the North for kidnapping, assassination, torture, and thuggery, but their focus is on information gathering because the organization believes that information is power. Most Krakenar join the group in order to advance their own personal power and wealth, but few suspect that the leader of the organization, Slarkrethel (NE male kraken sorcerer 20, Serpah of Umberlee) seeks to build a kingdom encompassing the depths of the Trackless Sea and the western coast of Faerún.

Local agents of the Kraken Society include the Skum Lord (LE aboleth sorcerer 6/cleric 7) and Meritid Archneie (CE male Tethyrian human cleric 15 (Umberlee); see page 50 ).

### Red Sashes

The Red Sashes are a vigilante group active in Waterdeep's poorer neighborhoods, particularly Dock Ward. Answering only to "the One" (Durnan, see Lords of Waterdeep), the Red Sashes excel at intrigue, hiding people, and finding people who do not want to be found. The Red Sashes appear to work against the Lords of Waterdeep, but in truth, they often end up serving the Lords indirectly.

Unlike most vigilantes, the Red Sashes do not act impetuously or excessively. They keep a close eye on Waterdeep's seamy underbelly, carefully observing the abused and their abusers. If the Watch seems inclined to step in and actually serve the cause of justice, then the Red Sashes remain in the shadows. However,

---

if the Watch pursues an innocent person, the Red Sashes might surreptitiously assist his escape. Likewise, if the Watch seems disinclined to pursue someone who has committed a crime, the Red Sashes might apprehend the wrongdoer and deposit him on the Palace steps. Such public captures both embarrass the Watch and draw public attention to the case.

The Red Sashes are organized into cells, one per ward, each answerable only to "the One." The Castle, Trades, and Dock Ward cells are the strongest and most active. Most Red Sashes only know the identities of their fellow cell members, meaning that the arrest of the few cannot unravel the whole organization. Coordination among the various cells is rare or nonexistent, and sometimes multiple cells have pursued the same individual. As "the One" seems capable of eluding all detection, magical or otherwise, the unmasking of a single cell leader has not yet led to another cell being penetrated.

Among the Lords of Waterdeep, only Khelben, Kitten, Mirt, Nindil, and Sammereza are aware of Durnan's involvement with the Red Sashes. The more practical Lords keep this information away from the paladins of the group, who would never approve of the group's methods. Laeral Silverhand Arunsun and the Unseen (see page 57) are among the few others who know Durnan's secret.

Base of Operations: Various taverns in Dock Ward.

### Red Sashes (Standard Criminal)

AL CG, CN, NG; 15,000 gp resource limit; Membership 137; Mixed (humans 87, shield dwarves 14, elves 14 , lightfoot halflings 7 , half-elves 7 , gnomes 4 , half-orcs 3 , others 1); Dues 5 gp/month (none to join).

Authority Figure: "The One" (Durnan; see Lords of Waterdeep).

Important Characters: Baklin (see below); Naneatha Lhaurilstar (see below); Jurisk Ulhammond (see below).

Associated Classes: Bard, expert, fighter, ranger, rogue, warrior.

Associated Skills: Bluff, Climb, Disguise, Gather Information, Knowledge (local), Sense Motive, Use Rope.

Requirements: You may not divulge secrets of the society to outsiders. You should be present in Waterdeep for an average of 10 hours per tenday, available to participate when summoned to action.

Favored in Guild Fringe Benefit: You are intimately familiar with one of Waterdeep's wards, and know many of its people and secrets. Choose one ward; while in that ward, you gain a  
+2 bonus on Gather Information, Search, Spot, Listen, and Sense Motive checks.

Joining the Red Sashes requires only an oath of loyalty to the One, but this is an organization that approaches potential members, not the other way around. Invitations to join the group are only made after a period of extended observation and a series of casual conversations crafted to draw out the potential candidate's views. Many members of the group take the vigilante ${ }^{\mathrm{C} A}$ prestige class.

Baklin: Baklin of Clan Stoneshaft (LN male shield dwarf fighter 7) is a stout, bearded dwarf, largely unremarkable among his kind. He tends bar at the Quaffing Quaggoth (C53), keeping an eye on goings-on for the Red Sashes.

Surrolph Hlakken: Surrolph (CG male commoner 16/vigilante ${ }^{\mathrm{CA}} 1$ ) is a fat, balding man with thick fingers who wears fine robes that have long since lost their original sheen. Surrolph is a horse dealer at the Hlakken stables (S17) and the chief information gatherer for the Red Sashes.

Naneatha Lharilstar: Naneatha (NG female Chondathan rogue 6/ vigilante ${ }^{\mathrm{CA}} 5$ ) is an olive-skinned beauty with raven black hair and striking green eyes. She works as a courtesan at the Palace and owns her own domicile (C45). Naneatha is the leader of the Castle Ward cell and one of two ward leaders who know that "the One" is Durnan.

Jurisk Ulhammond: Jurisk (CG male human rogue 5/fighter 8 /vigilante ${ }^{\mathrm{CA}} 1$ ) is a mousy-looking man with a thin, prematurely gray hair who looks much older than his age. He favors ink-stained robes and endless cups of boiling hot tea. Jurisk is a moneylender and the leader of a Trades Ward cell. As one of the most trusted lieutenants of "the One," Jurisk is only one of two Red Sashes who knows that Durnan is "the One."

By chance, Jurisk fell afoul of a greater doppelganger ${ }^{\mathrm{MF}}$ of the Unseen one month ago during while indulging in a visit with his favorite courtesan. Jurisk's identity is now a façade for Ptola (see page 58), one of Hlaavin's lieutenants. The Unseen are only beginning to decide what to do with these newly verified suspicions, but it will almost certainly play into Hlaavin's efforts to manipulate the Lords of Waterdeep.

### The Tel Teuküra

The Tel Teuküra (an Elven word that translates as "Moonstars" or "Silverstars") are a group of renegade Harpers and allies of the Blackstaff who seek to bring together humans, elves, and

---

other races against the many dangers lurking in the shadows of Faerûn. The members of the Tel Teukiira seek to learn from the lessons of history, preserving and learning from the lore of lost civilizations. Although the Lord and Lady Arunsun still believe that the goals of Those Who Harp are right and true, the Blackstaff formed the Tel Teukiira to address goals that range far beyond the scope of Harper activities. In the Year of the Laughing Swan ( 816 DR), Khelben, in the guise of a cloistered monk of Candlekeep, discovered dire threats within Alaundo's Prophecies that no one else had ever perceived. At first Khelben hoped to counter these threats through his shepherding of the Harpers, but over time the group slipped from his control.

In the Year of the Prince ( 1357 DR), Khelben stole the Scepter of the Sorcerer Kings from the Harper vault known as the Catacombs of Ordulin and replaced it with an illusory duplicate. Over a decade later, he made sure the Scepter fell into the hands of Fzoul Chembryl, head of the Zhentarim. Fzoul used the Scepter to destroy the banelich ${ }^{\mathrm{MF}}$ Faram Khaldan. When Khelben's action was discovered in the Year of the Tankard (1370 DR), the Harpers of Twilight Hall in Berdusk put Khelben on trial, and the Blackstaff admitted his guilt and resigned from Those Who Harp. Khelben then founded the Tel Teukiira, putting in motion his long-brewing plan.

Organizationally, the Tel Teukiira shares much in common with the Harpers, except that the group is under the firm direction of the Blackstaff. Laeral has no official standing within the group, but she speaks with authority second only to Khelben. Reporting directly to the Blackstaff are twelve senior agents, who meet in conclave every eight tendays and have the individual authority to shepherd regional and active agents. Thirty regional agents serve as the eyes and ears of the group, monitoring events and news within a broad region. Finally, twelve active field agents are in the forefront of the group's activities, implementing the decisions of the senior agents.

Base of Operations: The Tel Teukiira is headquartered at Blackstaff Tower (C6), but most members live elsewhere in the Realms and rarely, if ever, physically visit. The group's true base of operation is the Silver Safehold, an extraplanar stronghold built by the Sword Heralds of Cormyr and accessible to members of the group by means of their Teukiir badges". The Safehold acts as a central meeting hall for all members, a private meeting chamber for senior agents, a small dormitory for agents hiding out from other forces, and a library for the lore to be collected and shared by the members.

Tel Teukiira (Minor Special): AL NG, LG, LN; 100,000 gp resource limit; Membership 56; Integrated (humans 21, elves 11, half-elves 10 , gnomes 3 , tiefling 1 , vampire 1 , others 9 )

Authority Figures: Khelben "Blackstaff Arunsun (LN male human [Chosen of Mystra] wizard 24/archmage 3; see page 53); Laeral Silverhand Arunsun (see page 25 ).

Important Characters: Kiirma Blackmane (LE female halfwood elf rogue 5 /sorcerer 6/shadow thief of Amn ${ }^{\text {PG }} 2 /$ arcane trickster 3, shadowmaster of Riatavin); Calhyar of the Winds (LN female Rashemi human wizard 7/hathran ${ }^{\text {PG }} 10$, third-senior Witch of Mulsantir); Zandess Danthiir (LG female Calishite  
human paladin 6/martyred champion of Ilmater ${ }^{\mathrm{PG}} 4$ [Ilmater], Tethyrian noble active in Impiltur); Janxar "Sharpaxe" Dhoarn (LN male half-moon elf fighter 14, Alaghön's richest mercenary captain); Malchor Harpell (NG male Illuskan human wizard 20/archmage 5, Khelben's greatest apprentice after Laeral and most skeptical member); Phaerl Hawksong (CG female moon elf cleric 15 [Sehanine], senior priestess at the Tower of Moon's Magic in Evereska); Jhuvik of the Seven Gems ( N male wood elf rogue 5 /cleric 10 [Mystra]); Myrmeen Lhal (NG female Chondathan human ranger 12 [Tymora], lord of Arabel); The Mistmaster (CN male Illuskan human cleric 9/illusionist 16 [Deneir], mysterious resident of the Citadel of the Mists); Mintiper Moonsilver (CN male Tethyrian human bard 19, famed bard of the North); Lord of Mystery Telornym (NG male Chondathan human cleric 5/sorcerer 4/dweomerkeeper ${ }^{\text {PP }}$ 6 [Mystra], second-ranking priest at the Tower of Mysteries in Saerloon); Fourth Reader Shaynara Tullastar ( N female Tethyrian human cleric 11 [Oghma], one of Candlekeep's most valuable researchers).

Associated Classes: Any.  
Associated Skills: Concentration, Decipher Script, Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge (history), Perform, Spellcraft.

Requirements: None.  
Favored in Guild Fringe Benefit: The Moonstars count many skilled magical artisans among their friends. Once per character level you can purchase a single magic item of $50,000 \mathrm{gp}$ or less for $75 \%$ of its normal market price.

Special: Joining the Tel Teukiira requires the personal invitation of the Blackstaff or Lady Arunsun.

Members of the Tel Teukiira can take the Moonstar agent* prestige class, if they meet the requirements. Former members of the Harpers with levels in the various Harper prestige classes (Harper agent ${ }^{\mathrm{PG}}$ and Harper paragon ${ }^{\mathrm{PG}}$ ) are not considered "ExHarpers" and do not lose any of their current abilities when they leave the Harpers for the Moonstars, but they cannot continue to advance in such classes, reflecting the ambivalent relationship between the two groups. All Moonstars can acquire the Blessed of the Seven Sisters ${ }^{\mathrm{PG}}$ feat, assuming they meet the prerequisites.

Kylia: Although Kylia (CG female rock gnome illusionist 12/Moonstar agent ${ }^{\star} 1$ ) looks like a fragile doll of unassuming demeanor. With immaculate auburn hair and red robes, she is one of the Lords' most effective agents, having proved her skill by deducing the identities of nearly all the Lords simply through observation and then confronting Khelben with the fact. Her penchant for dramatics when using magic and need for attention have led her to work far more closely with Laeral than with Khelben. Kylia plays the role of "Liak," a male half-elf apprentice of "Irusyl Eraneth," during forays into the Port of Shadow. The gnome illusionist rooms at Madam Garah's boarding house (S30) and The Deepfires (LH7) in Skullport.

Winter Zulth: Winter (LN male half-moon-elf wizard 16) works in The Horizon's Sails (D62) as a mapmaker, creating the magic logbooks and maps for which the shop is famed. Winter has been actively involved in advocating a broad expansion of overseas trade for the city.

![img-14.jpeg](assets/City%20of%20Splendors,%20Waterdeep_img-14.jpeg)

Ihe City of Splendors is home to secret societies, elite orders, masters of the Art, and shadowy organizations. Many such groups have unique prestige classes associated with them.

Of the prestige classes described in the Dungeon Master's Guide, Waterdeep has a higher than average population of arcane tricksters, archmages, dragon disciples, eldritch knights, and thaumaturgists, reflecting its strong magical traditions. Assassins and shadowdancers are thankfully rare, but both have been steadily increasing in numbers since the Time of Troubles. Blackguards are here and there in positions of power and influence. Duelists, particularly those skilled in the Twin Sword Style ${ }^{\mathrm{PG}}$, are common among younger nobles. Hierophants and mystic theurges are uncommon, but not unknown, reflecting the lesser role played by the clergy in Waterdeep compared to guilds and arcane spellcasters. Loremasters are fairly common, particularly since the founding of New Olamn (C72).

Most of the prestige classes presented in the Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting and Player's Guide to Faerûn can be found in the City of Splendors. (All of the classes mentioned in the next two paragraphs are from Player's Guide to Faerûn.)

The return of the Shadow Thieves to Waterdeep has resulted in a sharp spike in the number of shadow thieves of Amn. Harper agents are not unknown, while Harper paragons are quite rare in Khelben's hometown. Red wizards, once absent, are now found in Waterdeep's Thayan enclave.

Divine champions, divine disciples, and divine seekers of any faith are relatively rare, more likely to be passing through Waterdeep than residents of the City of Splendors. The Church of Lathander includes many morninglords of Lathander among its ranks. The Church of Mystra includes many arcane devotees. Increasing numbers of shadow adepts have found a home in the Church of Shar, reflecting the growth in the number of spellcasters tapping into the Shadow Weave. The Church of Tyr and the ranks of Waterdeep's magisters count many justicars of Tyr among their ranks. The Cult of Ghaunadaur is led by a handful of slime lords.

Other prestige classes found in the City of Splendors include cognition thief ${ }^{\mathrm{PG}}$, dweomerkeeper ${ }^{\mathrm{PP}}$, goldeye ${ }^{\mathrm{PP}}$, guild mage of

Waterdeep ${ }^{\mathrm{Ma}}$, heartwarder ${ }^{\mathrm{PP}}$, mage-killer ${ }^{\mathrm{Ma}}$, master alchemist ${ }^{\mathrm{Ma}}$, martyred champion of Ilmater ${ }^{\mathrm{PG}}$, maiden of pain ${ }^{\mathrm{PG}}$, nightcloak ${ }^{\mathrm{PP}}$, silverstar ${ }^{\mathrm{PP}}$, Thayan knight ${ }^{\mathrm{LD}}$, Thayan slaver ${ }^{\mathrm{La}}$, techsmith ${ }^{\mathrm{PP}}$, and warrior skald ${ }^{\text {Res }}$.

This chapter presents a number of prestige classes common to the City of Splendors: the Gray Hand enforcer, the Knight of the Blue Moon, the Moonstar agent, and the Sun Soul monk.

### Gray Hand Enforcer

"Come here, little demon, and stop tormenting the nice townsfolk … I will squash you like a bug."  
-Harshnag the Grim  
Gray Hand enforcers are highly trained members of the Gray Hands, Waterdeep's elite, high-powered fighting force. They answer only to the Lords of Waterdeep and are selected for their ability to deal quickly with enemies of unusual personal power. Through rigorous training, Gray Hand enforcers gain the ability to shrug off physical damage and magical attacks alike.

### Becoming a Gray Hand Enforcer

Barbarians, fighters, and rangers most commonly become Gray Hand enforcers, although members of all classes and many races (particularly monstrous humanoids and giants) have served among the ranks of the Gray Hands.

The most important requirement of a Gray Hand enforcer is the ability to deal damage, followed closely by the ability to take large amounts of damage. Melee-oriented characters should emphasize Strength and Constitution, while those specializing in ranged or sneak attacks should focus on Dexterity and

---

Constitution, and then Strength. Spellcasters are best served by emphasizing their primary mental attribute to maximize the number of bonus spells they can cast. Spellcasters should also focus on Constitution to improve their hit points as well as Dexterity and Wisdom to improve their saving throws.

### Entry Requirements

Alignment: Any nonevil.  
Skills: Intimidate 5 ranks.  
Feats: Endurance, Toughness, and either Power Attack or Empower Spell.  
Special: Base attack bonus +7 or ability to cast 4 th-level spells. Special: Must be a member of the Gray Hands (see page 37).

### Class Features

All of the following are class features of the Gray Hand enforcer prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Gray Hand enforcers gain no proficiency with any weapons, armor, or shields.

Spellcasting: A Gray Hand enforcer continues training in magic. At every Gray Hand enforcer level beyond 1st, you gain new spells per day and an increase in caster level (and spells known, if applicable) as if you had also gained a level in a spellcasting class you belonged to before adding the prestige class. You do not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. If you had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a Gray Hand enforcer, you must decide to which class you add the new level for purposes of determining spells per day, caster level, and spells known.

Damage Reduction (Ex): At 1st level, a Gray Hand enforcer gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage you take each time you are dealt damage from a weapon or natural attack. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0 . This ability improves to damage reduction $2 /-$ at 3 rd level, and damage reduction $3 /-$ at 5 th level.

Gray Hand Token: All Gray Hand enforcers are given a small token, usually a clasp, ring, or brooch in the shape of a human hand, fingers together and palm out. Civic officials of Waterdeep (including Lords, magistrates, and Watch and Guard officers) know the token by sight. You gain a +5 bonus on any Charisma-based skill checks made against an officer or official  
of Waterdeep if you show the token. A bearer of the token may not be arrested or hindered in Waterdeep unless the arresting official is a Lord, magistrate, or civilar of the Guard or Watch.

Dragonward Strike (Su): By calling upon the power of Alghairon's dragonward, the Gray Hand enforcer can launch a mighty attack. Beginning at 2nd level, you can make a single melee attack with a +4 bonus on the attack roll and a bonus on the damage roll equal to your Gray Hand enforcer level. You must declare the strike before making the attack.

Instead of using the dragonward strike to make a melee attack, you can empower a single spell as if you had applied the Empower Spell feat. You do not have to prepare the spell as an empowered spell ahead of time, and this does not increase the level of the spell. You can use a dragonward strike once per day, or two times per day beginning at 4 th level.

In either case, the dragonward strike is only usable within 10 miles of Waterdeep, since it relies on proximity to Ahghairon's spell.

Spell Resistance (Ex): At 4th level, you gain spell resistance equal to $5+$ your character level. For exämple, as a fighter 10/Gray Hand enforcer 4, you would have spell resistance 19.

Lords' Boon (Su): At 5th level, you gain the ability to heal your own wounds. You can heal 20 hit points each day. You can use the healing all at once, or spread it out among several uses.

### Playing a Gray Hand Enforcer

You are tough as nails and every bit as dangerous as your reputation suggests. You have earned the trust of Waterdeep's leaders at great personal risk, and you have little fear of death. You have no time for moral niceties or negotiation; you trust the Lords to call you in only when right is on your side and complete annihilation of the enemy is the only remaining resort. You are fiercely loyal to the City of Splendors, allowing no one to besmirch the name or reputation of your great city.

### COMBAT

Gray Hand enforcers must deal out large amounts of damage quickly, regardless of the consequences to the surrounding area. Gray Hand enforcers are also incredibly tough, able to withstand large numbers of dangerous attacks without finching or falling. For spellcasters, evocation and summoning spells are two quick ways to take out a foe. Abjuration spells are also important, as

Table 3-1: The Gray Hand Enforcer

|  | Base Attack | Fort | Ref | Will | Special | Spellcasting |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Level | Bonus | Save | Save | Save |  |  |
| 1st | $+1$ | $+2$ | $+0$ | $+0$ | Damage reduction 1/-, Gray Hand token | $+1$ level of existing spellcasting class |

Class Skills ( $2+$ Int modifier per level): Climb, Concentration, Escape Artist, Heal, Intimidate, Jump, Knowledge (local), Listen, Ride, Spellcraft, Spot, Swim, Tumble, Use Magic Device, and Use Rope.

---

they allow members of your team to fight longer. Avoid divination spells (if it moves, kill it-nothing else matters), illusions (if your reputation doesn't scare your foe, nothing will), and enchantments (if it was susceptible to reason, you wouldn't be needed). For melee combatants, make sure you can always get to your foe (missile weapons or the ability to run, climb, jump, or fly) and when you do, deal large amounts of damage (big, powerful weapons with large threat ranges or critical multipliers).

## ADVANCEMENT

You want to acquire spells and magic items that enable you to survive the sorts of fights for which the Gray Hands are famous. Anything else is secondary. If you survive, you will inevitably advance.

### RESOURCES

The Gray Hands are an elite organization, fully backed by Waterdeep's treasury. Don't worry about collateral damage in service to the Lords; destruction of private property is never your concern. If you need a weapon or suit of armor, the Watchful Order of Magists \& Protectors would be happy to fabricate such for you as quickly as they can. You must still pay for personal armaments, but simply having the ear of the city's most powerful spellcasters is helpful enough.

### Gray Hand Enforcers in the World

The Gray Hands are the elite strike force in the employ of the Lords of Waterdeep. When called upon, they battle fearlessly against any threat to the City of Splendors. The Gray Hands organization is described in detail on page 37.

### NPC REACTIONS

Gray Hand enforcers are an unknown quantity outside the City of Splendors. In Waterdeep, the Gray Hands have acquired a fearsome reputation. Word that the members of the Gray Hands have been spotted is enough to send most Waterdhavians fleeing, as any battle involving Gray Hand enforcers is likely to result in a lot of collateral damage and civilian casualties.

### Gray Hand Enforcer Lore

The Gray Hands are well known in the City of Splendors, although their exact role in service to the Lords is the subject of some confusion. Characters who succeed on a Knowledge (local Waterdeep) check can learn the following information, including the information from lower DCs.

DC 10: The Lords of Waterdeep are served by an elite team of adventurers, known as the Gray Hands.

DC 11: The Gray Hands are dispatched only when the City Watch or City Guard cannot handle a problem. If you see a large frost giant heading your way, get out of the area as fast as you can.

### Hartburg the Grim, a Gray Hand Enforcer

DC 20: The leader of the Gray Hands is the ranger Jardwim. He's tough as nails and as inflexible as the Blackstaff. He figures if the Lords need his merry little band, then things are long past the discussion stage. Your only hope if you cross the Gray Hands is to surrender or die.

---

### Gray Hand Enforcers in the Game

Any powerful adventurer resident in Waterdeep and loyal to the Lords could be a member of the Gray Hands. The team is a glorified adventuring band with a low survival rate and a steady influx of new recruits.

This prestige class appeals to gamers who like to battle powerful foes using every resource at their disposal. It's especially appropriate for a Waterdeep-based campaign where the City of Splendors is under continual threat.

NPC Gray Hand enforcers are always based in Waterdeep, available to defend the City of Splendors in a moment's notice.

### Adaptation

While the Gray Hands are presented as unique to Waterdeep, there is no reason you could not create similar organizations in other wealthy cities such as Baldur's Gate, Suzail, Tantras, or Telflamm.

### EnCOUNTERS

The Gray Hand enforcers are most commonly encountered by renegade adventuring companies who believe themselves powerful enough to mess with anyone without consequence. The Gray Hands can also be brought in if the PCs take on a foe too powerful for them in or around the streets of Waterdeep, but the Gray Hands aren't really in the business of rescuing adventurers who can't take care of themselves.

EL 14: Harshnag the Grim is a typically beefy-frost giant with snow-white skin, light blue braided hair and beard, and light blue eyes. Exiled from his clan in the Spine of the World for his "soft" nature, Harshnag wandered south to see the world, eventually entering the City of Splendors. Jardwim (see page 38 ) was impressed by Harshnag's polite response after the Gray Hands were dispatched to stop Hárshnag's expected  
rampage, and he invited the frost giant to join the group. Today, Harshnag lives in a cave atop Mount Sar, linked to Blackstaff Tower (C6) by a large-sized two-way keyed portal. Maliantor, a Gray Hand wizard, alerts Harshnag by means of a sending spell whenever the giant is needed in the City of Splendors.

Harshnag the Grim: Male frost giant Gray Hand enforcer 5; CR 14; Large giant (cold); HD 14d8+98 plus 5d10+37 plus 3; hp 228; Init +4; Spd 30 ft. in +4 full plate armor (base 40 ft .); AC 30 , touch 9 , flat-footed 30 ; Base Atk +15 ; Grp +31 ; Atk +28 melee ( $3 \mathrm{~d} 6+19 / \times 3,+1$ buman bane thundering greataxe) or +26 melee ( $1 \mathrm{~d} 4+12$, slam) or +15 ranged ( $2 \mathrm{~d} 6+12$, rock); Full Atk $+28 /+23 /+18$ melee ( $3 \mathrm{~d} 6+19 / \times 3,+1$ buman bane thundering greataxe) or $+26 /+26$ melee ( $1 \mathrm{~d} 4+12,2$ slams) or +15 ranged ( $2 \mathrm{~d} 6+12$, rock); Space/Reach $10 \mathrm{ft} . / 10 \mathrm{ft}$.; SA dragonward strike 2/day, rock throwing; SQ damage reduction 3/-, immunity to cold, Lords' boon, low-light vision, rock catching, spell resistance 24 , vulnerability to fire; AL CG; SV Fort +20 , Ref +5 , Will +6 ; Str 34, Dèx 11, Con 24, Int 10, Wis 12, Cha 12.

Skills and Feats: Climb +14 , Craft (weaponsmithing) +6 , Intimidate +13 , Jump +14 , Spot +13 ; Cleave, Endurance, Great Cleave, Improved Initiative, Power Attack, Toughness, Weapon Focus (greataxe).

Languages: Common, Giant.  
Rock Throwing (Ex): Range increment 120 feet.  
Dragonward Strike (Su): Harshnag can use a dragonward strike two times per day, as long as he is within 10 miles of Waterdeep. He makes a single melee attack with a +4 bonus on the attack roll and a +5 bonus on the damage roll.

Rock Catching (Ex): See Monster Manual page 120.  
Lords' Boon (Su): Harshnag can heal himself up to 20 hit points per day. He can use the healing all at once, or spread it out among several uses.

## Swift and Immediate Actions

The Miniatures Handbook introduced the concept of a new action type: the swift action. Likewise, the Expanded Psionics Handbook introduced another new action type: the immediate action. Some of the prestige class features, spells, and magic items in City of Splendors use these concepts. A description of how they work follows.

Swift Action: A swift action consumes a very small amount of time, but represents a larger expenditure of effort and energy than a free action. You can perform one swift action per turn without affecting your ability to perform other actions. In that regard, a swift action is like a free action. However, you can perform only a single swift action per turn, regardless of what other actions you take. You can take a swift action any time you would normally be allowed to take a free action. Swift actions usually involve magic or psionics, or the activation of magic or psionic items; many characters (especially those who don't use magic or psionics) never have an opportunity to take a swift action.

Casting a quickened spell is a swift action. In addition, casting any spell with a casting time of 1 swift action is a swift action.

Casting a spell or with a casting time of 1 swift action does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

Immediate Action: Much like a swift action, an immediate action consumes a very small amount of time, but represents a larger expenditure of effort and energy than a free action. Unlike a swift action, an immediate action can be performed at any time-even if it's not your turn. Using an immediate action on your turn is the same as using a swift action, and counts as your swift action for that turn. You cannot use another immediate action or a swift action until after your next turn if you have used an immediate action when it is not currently your turn (effectively, using an immediate action before your turn is equivalent to using your swift action for the conling turn). You also cannot use an immediate action if you are currently flat-footed.

### Knight of the Blue Moon

"Observe the waxing and waning of the moon, and watch how the Weave ebbs and flows in response. 'Tis the Daughter of the Moonmaiden responding to the tug of her mother's bosom."  
-Xale of the Starry Glen  
Knights of the Blue Moon are elite soldiers in the endless battle against the Mistress of the Night. Their tactics are strictly governed by the phase of the moon, for they are strongest when the moon is full and weakest when the moon is new. Drawing on Selûne's tidal influence over the Weave, they attack when the moon is waxing and their offensive powers grow strong, and they defend when the moon is waning and their defensive powers move to the fore.

### Becoming a

### Knight of the Blue Moon

Cleric/sorcerers and paladin/sorcerers make good Knights of the Blue Moon, for they combine a diverse array of spontaneously cast spells with the ability to channel the divine power of their deity. Cleric/bards and even ex-bard/paladins can also become Knights of the Blue Moon, although they are far less common.

Depending on your base spellcasting class or classes, you'll find that Wisdom or Charisma remains your most valuable ability score. If you choose to emphasize your capabilities as a sorcerer, you might wish to emphasize your Dexterity as well, allowing you to become a ranged combatant. Otherwise, the usual mix of Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution are likely to be as important to you as they are to all melee combatants.

### Entry Requirements

Alignment: Any good.  
Base Attack Bonus: +4 .  
Skills: Concentration 8 ranks, Knowledge (arcana) 4 ranks, Knowledge (religion) 4 ranks.  
Feats: Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Lunar Magic", and either Weapon Focus (heavy mace) or Exotic Weapon Proficiency (shuriken).  
Spells: Ability to cast arcane spells spontaneously.  
Patron Deity: Selûne or Mystra.  
Special: Ability to turn undead, membership in the Order of the Blue Moon (see page 44).

### Class Features

All of the following are class features of the Knight of the Blue Moon prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Knights of the Blue Moon gain no proficiency with any weapons, armor, or shields. Selûne's favored weapon is the heavy mace, which Knights of the Blue Moon refer to as the moon's hand. Mystra's favored weapon is the shuriken, which Knights of the Blue Moon refer to as whirlstars.

Spellcasting: A Knight of the Blue Moon continues training in magic. When you gain a level in this class, you gain new spells per day and an increase in caster level (and spells known, if applicable) as if you had also gained a level in a spellcasting class you belonged to before adding the prestige class. You do not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. If you had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a Knight of the Blue Moon, you must decide to which class you add the new level for purposes of determining spells per day, caster level, and spells known.

Moon Blessing (Su): During days and nights of the waning or new moon, you can channel the influence of Selûne over the Weave to reduce the impact of magic directed at you. At the cost of a single attempt to turn undead, you receive a sacred bonus equal to +1 per class level on a single saving throw against a spell or spell-like ability. Using this ability is an immediate action (see the sidebar on page 80 ).

During days and nights of the waxing or full moon, you can channel the influehce of Selûne over the Weave to increase the impact of magic cast by you. At the cost of a single attempt to turn undead, you increase the saving throw DC of a single use of a spell or spell-like ability by an amount equal to your class level. Using this ability is a swift action (see the sidebar on page 80 ).

Special Mount: At 1st level, you can call a special mount. This ability is identical to the paladin ability of the same name, except the mount will always match your alignment. Levels of paladin and Knight of the Blue Moon stack for purposes of determining the special mount's abilities. In addition, if you do not have a familiar, levels of sorcerer or wizard also stack for purposes of determining the special mount's abilities.

Faerie Fire (Sp): At 2nd level, you can use faerie fire, as the spell, three times per day.

Lunar Sight (Ex): Knights of the Blue Moon of 2nd level and above have low-light vision. If you already have low-light vision, you instead gain improved low-light vision, which means that you see four times as far as a human in conditions of poor illumination.

Divine Moonlight (Su): At 3rd level, any spell with the light descriptor is heightened by one level, as if you had the Heighten Spell feat. The spell does not require a spell slot of higher level or require you to prepare such spells in advance.

Selûne's Foresight (Su): At 3rd level, you can tap into the prophetic powers associated with the moon, giving you a +2 insight bonus on initiative rolls.

Weavesight (Sp): At 4th level, you can use arcane sight, as the spell, three times per day.

Moon Kiss (Su): At 5th level, you can channel the silver light of Selûne into weapons or armor you use. When the moon is waxing or full, at the cost of a single attempt to turn undead, a magic weapon you wield receives the property of brilliant

---

energy for 1 round. This use of the ability is a swift action (see the sidebar on page 80 ).

When the moon is waning or new, at the cost of a single attempt to turn undead, armor you wear receives the property of spell resistance (SR 10 + character level) for 1 round. Using this ability is an immediate action (see the sidebar on page 80 ).

### Playing a Knight of the Blue Moon

Although the Lady of Loss can never be defeated, you are a dedicated foe of the forces of darkness, bitterness, and loss, battling the followers of Shar wherever they appear. Where others see weakness in the endless waning and waxing of the Moonmaiden, you see a way to control the ebb and flow of combat. Where others are tempted by the dark power of the Shadow Weave, you see hidden power in the tidal fluctuations of the Weave.

You excel at tactics, always seeking to maximize your advantage over your foes. You see the glass as it is, both half empty and half full, untroubled by temporary setbacks or inclined to rash behavior thanks to unexpected victory. You live your life in accordance with the heavens, advancing when the signs are favorable and retreating when dire portents beckon.

### COMBAT

You live for the chance to battle the followers of Shar, but are careful to pick your time and your battlefield. You prefer to find a small redoubt and then sally forth for brief periods before retreating and concentrating on defense.

### ADVANCEMENT

Qualifying for the Knight of the Blue Moon class requires a significant number of feats and skill points. Moreover, many multiclass combinations that work well with the class are relatively weak, specializing in neither combat nor spellcasting. Regardless of how you met the entry requirements, consider the Extra Turning feat and then focus on either spellcasting or combat. You should choose your spells to give you a good variety of offensive and defensive options at every level.

If you want to multiclass while advancing as a Knight of the Blue Moon, pick one of your base classes and concentrate on it. Paladins, sorcerers, and wizards are particularly appropriate  
second classes if you intend to employ your special mount ability to great effect.

### RESOURCES

The Order of the Blue Moon is relatively new (less than two decades old) and is concentrated in lands where the church of Shar is powerful. Although it has little in the way of finances, the churches of Selûne and Mystra do all they can to support the Order in such lands.

In general, a Knight of the Blue Moon can obtain healing (or other spellcasting services) from a cleric of Selûne or Mystra at $25 \%$ of the normal cost, and his or her companions can obtain healing at $75 \%$ the normal cost.

### Knights of the Blue Moon in the World

The Order of the Blue Moon is a religious organization dedicated to Selûne and Mystra. Based north of Waterdeep, they are a growing presence in the City of Splendors despite tensions with the Mystran clergy in the House of Wonder (\$21). The Order of the Blue Moon is described in detail on page 44.

### NPC REACTIONS

The Order of the Blue Moon is a relatively new knightly order in a world that has large numbers of such religious organizations. Outside the city of Waterdeep, the Order's existence is largely unknown, and thus most NPCs treat it like any other crusading order-with wary regard. Those that do learn something of the Order in their roles as part of the church hierarchy of Selûne or Mystra are often put off by its perceived heresy of venerating both Selûne and Mystra. Displays of lunar magic engender great interest among students of the Art, for lunar magic is relatively unknown among those who study the many ways to manipulate the Weave.

### Knights of the Blue Moon Lore

The Order of the Blue Moon is known in the City of Splendors, but most folks think it a knightly order that serves a specific church, like the Order of the Aster. Characters who succeed on a Knowledge (local Waterdeep) or Knowledge (religion) check

can learn the following information, including the information from lower DCs.

DC 10: The Moonmaiden's temple is defended by the Knights of the Blue Moon, a newly founded religious order.

DC 15: While the Order of the Blue Moon is backed by both the Moonmaiden and the Lady of Mysteries, it has much stronger support from the church of Selune than it does from the church of Mystra.

DC 20: The Order of the Blue Moon has an isolated chapterhouse on one of the Red Rocks.

### Knights of the Blue Moon in the Game

Given their limited number, the Knights of the Blue Moon rarely act in concert. They often have to hire adventurers, particularly those with ties to the church of Selune or the church of Mystra, to complete various missions on behalf of the Order. Sometimes, a single Knight of the Blue Moon joins with a small company of adventurers to accomplish a goal of the order. The Knights can even be used as a new weapon against the church of Shar.

The Knight of the Blue Moon prestige class appeals to a player who likes a variety of capabilities and the challenge of making tactical decisions. The prestige class is appropriate for those who like their characters to fight on the side of right against an endless tide of darkness. Your adventures don't all need to be consumed with the battle against the Church of Shar. Just make sure that a variety of tactics will be required over the course of your adventures. Some should demand aggressive action and others a stout defense.

### ADAPTATION

While the Knights of the Blue Moon are dedicated to Selune and Mystra, deities worshiped chiefly by humans, you can easily change the patrons of the order to Corellon Larethian and Sehanine Moonbow. Simply change the fast feat requirement to Weapon Focus (longsword) or Weapon Focus (quarterstaff).

### ENCOUNTERS

Knights of the Blue Moon are most commonly encountered as potential allies for player characters, particularly when the PCs are taking on the minions of Shar. The Knights are a particularly useful ally for characters who have begun to run afoul of the Shadow Weave and need to counter its pernicious influence.

EL 16: High Moonknight Xale of the Starry Glen stands well over 6 feet tall. He has jet-black hair streaked with silver, piercing blue eyes, and fair skin that gleams with a silvery radiance. Xale favors deep blue cloaks, silken shirts, and tailored breeches, all cut in the style of ancient Netheril.

The High Moonknight is a native of Selúnarra, a floating city that escaped the Fall of Netheril when the Moonmaiden transferred the city and all its inhabitants to the Gates of the Moon. Over time, the Netherese interbred with other inhabitants of Selune's domain, resulting in a race of extraplanar aasimar that still reside there today. Xale was unusual among his fellows in that he chose to worship Mystryl (as Mystra is still known to the Selúnarrans), although he continued to honor Selune.

Some years ago (at the end of the Time of Troubles), Xale found himself beneath a starry sky he did not recognize amid the trees of an elven woodland (Ardeep Forest). In the sky, he saw a vision of a full moon surrounded by a ring of seven stars that seemed to be leading him north and west. In time, Xale came to the City of Splendors and made his way to the House of Wonder. He continued to experience visions of the moon, however, which led him to the House of the Moon as well. Once he learned of a vision shared by the two churches of a knightly order dedicated to opposing the machinations of Shar, Xale immediately volunteered to lead the new order, seeing it as the realization of his calling.

### MOONSTAC AgGENT

"Despite the self-aggrandizing puffery of those windbags at Twilight Hall, the Blackstaff stands, as ever, unbowed. But then again, that's what makes bim so much fun to tease."  
—Kyriani Agrivar  
Moonstar agents, also known as Teukiir, are members of the Tel Teukira, a group founded in the Year of the Tankard ( 1370 DR) by Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun when he broke from the Harpers. Similar in many ways to Those Who Harp, Moonstar agents combine a keen understanding of history with a knack for spying on chosen targets and acquiring powerful artifacts. The group receives the blessings of three deities long favored by the Blackstaff: Mystra, Oghma, and Sehanine Moonbow. In addition, Khelben and his consort, Laeral Silverhand Arunsun, perform arcane rituals reminiscent of elven high magic on members of the group, giving them special magical abilities.

### Becoming a Moonstar Agent

Bards, bard/rangers, bard/rogues, rogue/sorcerers, and rogue/wizards all make good Moonstar agents, for they combine a wide array of skills with arcane spellcasting ability. Single-classed sorcerers and wizards, ranger/sorcerers, ranger/wizards, and other bard multiclass options can also become Moonstar agents, although they are less common.

---

Depending on your base arcane spellcasting class, you will find that Intelligence or Charisma remains your most valuable ability score. You will also find that the art of gathering information, dodging surprise attacks, and manipulating others requires equal parts Dexterity and Charisma.

### Entry Requirements

Skills: Decipher Script 4 ranks, Gather Information 4 ranks, Knowledge (history) 8 ranks.  
Feats: Investigator, Stealthy.  
Spells: Ability to cast disguise self and identify.  
Special: Bardic knowledge, lore (loremaster class feature or any similar ability), Harper knowledge, or ability to cast legend lore. Special: Member of the Tel Teukiira (see page 75).

### Class Features

All of the following are class features of the Moonstar agent prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Moonstar agents gain no proficiency with any weapons, armor, or shields.

Spellcasting: When a new Moonstar agent level is gained, you gain new spells per day and an increase in caster level (and spells known, if applicable) as if you had also gained a level in a spellcasting class you belonged to before adding the prestige class. You do not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained, except for an increased effective level of spellcasting. This essentially means that you add the level of Moonstar agent to the level of some other spellcasting class you have, then determine spells per day, caster level, and spells known accordingly.

Lore (Ex): Like a bard, a Moonstar agent has a knack for picking up odd bits of knowledge. This ability works exactly like the bardic knowledge ability of the bard class. If you have bard levels (or levels in another class with the same ability, such as loremaster or Harper agent), your Moonstar agent levels and bard levels (or levels in the other appropriate class) stack for the purpose of using Moonstar agent knowledge.

Oghma's Insight: As masters of obscure lore, Moonstar agents develop a keen interest in many fields. You gain Skill Focus in any one Knowledge skill as a bonus feat.

Laeral's Intuition (Sp): At 2nd level, you can use detect thoughts, as the spell, three times per day.

Mystra's Boon (Su): At 3rd level, you gain a +2 sacred bonus on all saving throws against spells.

Khelben's Call (Sp): At 4th level, you can use sending, as the spell, as a standard action once per day.

Uncanny Dodge (Ex): When you reach 5th level, you retain your Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) regardless of being caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. (You still lose any Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized.)

If you gain uncanny dodge from a second class, you automatically gain improved uncanny dodge (see Player's Handbook page 50).

### Ex-Moonstar Agents

Any Moonstar agent who violates the code of the Tel Teukiira, endangers other Telkiir through negligence or deliberate action, or intentionally turns away from the Tel Teukiira quickly gains a reputation in the organization. Such an individual can no longer progress in the Moonstar agent prestige class. Furthermore, he can no longer use the supernatural or spell-like abilities of the class. A petition to Khelben Arunsun, fulfillment of a suitable quest set by the Blackstaff, and an atonement spell from a cleric of a deity chosen by Khelben brings the former Moonstar agent back into good standing. Thereafter, she regains the use of all class abilities and can once again gain levels in the prestige class.

### Moonstars and Harper Agents

Characters with levels in the Harper agent ${ }^{50}$ prestige class can take levels in the Moonstar agent prestige class without losing any of their Harper agent abilities, and vice versa.

### Playing a Moonstar Agent

Faerún is endlessly awash in the sweep of history, and once again the tides of change are rushing forward. You see the broad strokes of historical experience, placing the complications of today in the context of yesteryear. While time might march inexorably forward, the actions of a few can change the course of history, for weal or woe. Seek understanding of the context of what you do and the inexorable chain of events your actions precipitate. Do not worry overmuch regarding the immediate concerns of today, or tomorrow might not dawn.

---

### Combat

Your greatest weapons are knowledge of the past and understanding of the present; your skill is in knowing how to use that understanding to your advantage. Master the Art, but use it wisely, for the ostentatious use of magic will only draw attention to your activities. Spells of divination and illusion serve to both reveal the actions of your foes and shield your own activities in turn. Do not attack directly if another hand can be directed to serve the purpose. Watch from the shadows, emerging only to whisper in the right car or subtly manipulate a situation.

### ADVANCEMENT

You want to acquire spells and magic items that help you gather information and shield your activities from the prying eyes of others. Spells such as arcane eye, clairaudience/clairvoyance, detect thoughts, and scrýing enable you to spy on your foes from afar. Spells such as comprehend languages, disguise self, invisibility, pass without trace, silence, and tongues enable surreptitious information gathering. Spells such as analyze dweomer, identify, and legend lore allow you to investigate artifacts, and spells such as message, sending, and whispering wind allow you to communicate with your fellows over long distances.

Skills such as Hide, Gather Information, and Move Silently facilitate your ability to gather information, while Knowledge (arcana) and Knowledge (history) allow you to understand the lost magical lore of ancient civilizations. Bluff, Diplomacy, and Sense Motive allow you to manipulate others for the long-term ends of the Tel Teukiira.

### RESOURCES

Although the Tel Teukiira is a young group, it can call upon all the resources of the Blackstaff, not to mention their powerful colleagues. In practice, this means Moonstar agents have access to the vast magical resources of Blackstaff Tower (C6), albeit only in cases of demonstrable need, and indirect access to the resources of Those Who Harp (primarily through Harpers who are inclined favorably to the Tel Teukiira) and the Lords of Waterdeep (of which Khelben and Kyriani Agrivar are members). Moonstar agents can employ either Blackstaff Tower or (assuming they have a Teukiir badge) the Silver Safehold as a refuge when needed.

### Moonstar Agents in the World

The Tel Teukiira, which translates to "Moonstars" in the common tongue, is a shadowy group of ex-Harpers who broke from Those Who Harp to pursue the mysterious objectives of the Blackstaff. The Tel Teukiira is described in detail on page 75.

### NPC ReACTIONS

The Tel Teukiira is a secretive group that few have even heard of. If a hero is revealed to be a member of the Tel Teukiira, most NPCs would mistake them for Harpers in the service of the ever-meddling Blackstaff. Most Harpers of the North and the Dalelands remain favorably inclined toward Khelben and any agents who serve in his employ. In contrast, Harpers closely affiliated with Twilight Hall in Berdusk are likely to view members of the Tel Teukiira as traitors (if they are ex-

Harpers) or untrustworthy (if they are revealed to serve the traitorous Blackstaff).

### Moonstar Agents Lore

The Tel Teukiira are well hidden in the City of Splendors because the group works hard to hide its existence, and the bulk of the group's activities and agents are located in cities across Faerûn. Characters who succeed on a Gather Information check can learn the following information, including the information from lower DCs.

DC 15: Ever since he resigned from the Lords, the Blackstaff has been assembling a private army of meddlers even worse than Those Who Harp.

DC 25: The Tel Teukiira are behind the fall-off in Zhentarim activity in western Faerûn. The Blackstaff and his agents made some deal with the tyrant of the Moonsea to divide control of the Realms.

Characters who learn the name "Tel Teukiira" and succeed on a Knowledge (history) check can learn the following information.

DC 25: Amagal's Tome, an ancient Elven text of early Cormanthor, notes that the Tel Teukiira "will come hidden and in many guises and faces. They dwell in shadow and speak in omens, yet they shall bring about waking dreams and save us from the Three Threats Who Wait in Darkness, the Prefects, and ourselves."

Even members of the Tel Teukiira are uncertain as to what this means, although most suspect that Khelben knows and does not say.

### Moonstar Agents in the Game

Most high-ranking Teukiir are not (yet) members of the Moonstar agent prestige class, although new recruits usually take at least one level of the class. NPC Moonstar agents can be found in small numbers in cities and kingdoms across Faerûn, although the largest concentration of such characters is found in Waterdeep and the North.

The Tel Teukiira works best as a mysterious organization operating behinds the scenes. The Moonstars might be engaged in a silent war in the shadows with an evil group, leaving the PCs to untangle what is going on when they chance upon such activity. The Tel Teukiira can also act as patrons (or manipulators) of the characters, overtly or indirectly guiding them into new adventures that ultimately serve the Blackstaff's aims. The Tel Teukiira can also be used as foes (at least initially) if the PCs are dispatched by the Harpers of Twilight Hall to uncover the plots of the Blackstaff.

### Adaptation

While the Tel Teukiira is presented as an offshoot of the Harpers founded and run by the Blackstaff, they can easily be adapted to serve the role of a private army of infiltrators and spies. By dint of their personal power, many mages across Faerûn believe themselves entitled to manipulate the affairs of their neighbors. An archmage who succeeds in establishing such a group might

---

assemble a coterie of followers with powers similar to that of the Moonstars.

### EnCOUNTERS

Moonstar agents are most commonly encountered individually. They can act as patrons for the PCs, commissioning or suggesting the recovery of lost lore from an ancient ruin. They can act as manipulators, subtly or not, who attempt to use the characters to accomplish a particular goal. They can also act as spies, watching and observing the PCs or their foes. In the latter case, the characters might blunder into an ongoing Moonstar operation, forcing the Moonstar agent to adapt to the new situation.

EL 14: Kyriani Agrivar is the stunningly attractive, gray-eyed daughter of the late wizard Ostus Agrivar and a drow sorceress of Shadowdale. The lascivious and mischievous Kyriani has come to grips with her dual nature after twice separating into twin aspects of good and evil. When adventuring, Kyriani tucks up her shimmering silverwhite hair away from her face and favors high boots, form-fitting leather armor, and a cape. She prefers expensive, off-theshoulder floor-length gowns when attending parties or services at the House of the Moon (\$56), or some compromise between these extremes when  
![img-15.jpeg](assets/City%20of%20Splendors,%20Waterdeep_img-15.jpeg)

Kyriani Agriver, a Moonstar agent  
tending bar at Selûne's Smile (D6), a tavern she inherited from Luna (an avatar of Selûne) and now lives above.

Since the departure of Luna, Kyriani has begun an apprenticeship under Lady Alathene Moonstar (see page 62) and made rapid progress with her command of the Art. Although most of Kyriani's former adventuring companions are in Tethyr, having marched south with Haedrak and fought in the Reclamation Army, Kyriani still sees them and her half-brother, Priam Agrivar (LG male Illuskan human paladin 10), from time to time. Kyriani chose to remain in Waterdeep, where she has a veritable army of lovers and a lingering loyalty to the city in which Luna chose to reside.

After her companions departed, Kyriani rose quickly among the ranks of worshipers at the House of the Moon to become the most influential layperson in Waterdeep's church of the Moonmaiden. Now that Luna has returned to the outer planes, Kyriani has taken over her former tavern. Kyriani was invited to become a Lord of Waterdeep in the Year of the Banner ( 1368 DR), after Danilo Thann (see page 63) resigned. Danilo requested that his replacement represent the Fair Folk of Waterdeep, and Piergeiron  
chose Kyriani for her ability to span both worlds. Kyriani is also an agent of the Tel Teukiira, and she works closely with the Blackstaff on a variety of covert activities in that capacity.

### Sun Soul Monk

"Look within for the dawning light of the Morninglord, the twinkling diamonds of the Moonmaiden's raiment, and the shimmering corona of Lady Firehair's beauty. Let it shine forth from your soul, and the Yellow God shall be reborn through you."  
—Kadila adh Vitendi  
Monks of the Sun Soul Order believe that they each harbor a small fragment of the sun's divine essence, long absent from the Realms. Brothers and sisters of the Order of the Sun Soul are trained to tap into the "spiritual light" within-a tradition that developed during Amaunator's slow decline-and manifest it externally. The monks are loosely affiliated with the faiths of Lathander, Selúne, and Sune, and they share many common concerns with those churches. Staunch opponents of darkness, evil, and chaos, the Sun Soul-monks serve as crusaders against churches of evil deities, defenders of the common folk, and protectors of sites sacred to deities of light and good.

### Becoming a Sun Soul Monk

Monks and monk/paladins make the best Sun Soul monks. They are uniquely suited to the asceticism and discipline of the order. Cleric/monks are not uncommon among the followers of the Morninglord, but are exceedingly rare among the followers of Selúne and Sune because one-step alignment restrictions require such a character to be either an ex-monk or an ex-cleric. Clerics, fighters, paladins, rogues, and multiclass combinations thereof occasionally join the order, but their total collective numbers are small.

As with any combat-oriented character, you will find that a high Strength, Constitution, and Dexterity will serve you well. You will also want a high Wisdom to maximize the use of your "inner fire" combat abilities.

### Entry Requirements

Alignment: Lawful good or lawful neutral.  
Base Save Bonuses: Will +4 .  
Skills: Concentration 8 ranks, Knowledge (arcana) 4 ranks, Knowledge (religion) 4 ranks.  
Languages: Ignan, Loross.  
Feats: Athletic, Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning Fist.  
Patron Deity: Lathander, Selúne, or Sune.  
Special: Member of the Order of the Sun Soul (see page 41).

### Class Features

All of the following are class features of the Sun Soul monk prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Sun Soul monks are proficient with all simple weapons, but gain no new proficiency with  
any armor. You can treat a light mace as a special monk weapon for the purpose of your flurry of blows ability.

Monk Abilities: Sun Soul monk levels stack with monk levels for purposes of determining flurry of blows, unarmed damage, AC bonus, and unarmored speed bonus (see Table 3-10, page 40 of the Player's Handbook).

Sun Soul (Sp): You gain the ability to radiate magical light, equivalent in effect to a daylight spell with a duration of 1 minute per caster level, once per day per Sun Soul monk level. You and your clothing are the "object" from which the light emanates. Your caster level is equal to your combined monk, paladin, and Sun Soul monk levels.

Low-Light Vision (Ex): At 2nd level, you gain low-light vision if you don't already have it.

Sun Soulray (Sp): At 2nd level, you gain the ability to radiate and project a blast of light from an open palm, equivalent in effect to a searing light spell. Treat the caster level as equivalent to your combined monk, paladin, and Sun Soul monk levels. At 4th level, you can use this ability two times per day; at 6th level, three times per day; and at 8th level, four times per day.

Flaming Fists (Su): At 3rd level and beyond, you can channel your inner light into your unarmed attacks as a swift action (see page 80 ), giving them the flaming weapon special ability for a number of rounds equal to your Wisdom bonus (minimum 1). See the Dungeon Master's Guide, page 224.

At 6th level, you can use this ability two times per day, and you bestow the flaming burst weapon special ability on your unarmed attacks.

At 9th level, you can use this ability three times per day. You can choose to bestow either the flaming burst or brilliant energy weapon special ability on your unarmed attacks.

Abundant Step (Su): At 5th level or higher, you can slip magically between spaces, as if using the spell dimension door,

Hit Die: d 8 .  
Class Skills (4 + Int modifier per level): Balance, Climb, Concentration, Craft, Diplomacy, Escape Artist, Hide, Jump, Knowledge (arcana, history, and religion), Listen, Move Silently, Perform, Profession, Sense Motive, Spot, Swim, and Tumble.

---

once per day. Your caster level for this effect is one-half your combined monk and Sun Soul monk levels (rounded down).

Greater Sun Soul (Sp): At 7th level, you gain the ability to wreathe yourself in flames, equivalent in effect to a fire shield spell (warm version), once per day. Treat your caster level as equivalent to your combined monk, paladin, and Sun Soul monk levels.

Darkvision (Ex): At 8th level, you gain darkvision out to 60 feet if you don't already have it.

Sun Soulbeam (Sp): At 10th level, you gain the ability to emit dazzling beams of light, equivalent in effect to a sunbeam spell, once per day. Treat your caster level as equivalent to your combined monk, paladin, and Sun Soul monk levels.

Tongue of the Sun and Moon (Ex): At 10th level, you can speak with any living creature.

### Ex-Sun Soul Monks

A Sun Soul monk who becomes nonlawful cannot gain new levels as a Sun Soul monk, but retains all Sun Soul monk abilities.

Like a member of any other class, a Sun Soul monk can be a multiclass character, but multiclass Sun Soul monks face a special restriction. A Sun Soul monk can gain levels in one other class (other than monk) and still progress as a monk or as a Sun Soul monk, as long as long as his combined monk and Sun Soul monk levels exceed all other class levels.

### Playing a Sun Soul Monk

You are a dedicated servant of the common man, eschewing ostentatious consumptions of wealth, food, or libation. You almost never despair, no matter how dark things seem, for you have discovered your spiritual light within. You see yourself as a custodian of the sun's divinity and the inheritor of an ancient tradition, awaiting the day the sun returns to its proper glory and banishes the spiritual shadow from the world.

### Combat

You relish unarmed combat, particularly against foes vulnerable to fire, for in such battles you can truly unleash your inner fire. Thanks to your training, you can also use spell-like abilities that burn your enemies, a potent combination unexpected by most foes.

### ADVANCEMENT

Qualifying for the Sun Soul monk class requires a significant commitment of skill points. As you gain levels, you probably want to catch up in some of the more physical skills, including Balance, Climb, Jump, and Tumble. Moreover, you might find you have missed out on some combat feats as well. The order is known for its employment of the Sun School ${ }^{\mathrm{CW}}$ tactical feat; it is suggested that you acquire it as soon as you qualify.

If you want to multiclass as you advance, consider taking levels in monk or paladin. Many of your abilities stack with levels in these classes, so doing so maximizes your potential.

### RESOURCES

Although scattered and somewhat disorganized, the Order of the Sun Soul is known to most regions of Faerûn. As a result, it should be available to you no matter where you go. In general, a

Sun Soul monk can obtain healing from a cleric of Lathander at $25 \%$ of the normal cost, and from a cleric of Selûne or Sune at $50 \%$ of the normal cost. Her companions can obtain healing at $75 \%$ of the normal cost. A Sun Soul monk can obtain free room and board for herself (for any length of stay) and her companions (for one night) at any of the order's monasteries across Faerûn.

### Sun Soul Monks in the World

The Order of the Sun Soul is a monastic order spread across Faerûn. A monk with controversial beliefs about Amaunator, Lathander, Selûne, and Sune leads the chapter in Waterdeep. The Order of the Sun Soul is described in detail on page 41.

### NPC Reactions

The monks who join the Order of the Sun Soul are only one of many monastic and knightly orders found across Faerûn. Few commoners know much about the differences between these organizations, so Sun Soul monks are treated much as any other nonevil monks; most people admire their singlemindedness of purpose and dedication, but think that they are somewhat aloof.

Members of the church of Lathander welcome Sun Soul monks as allies because the two organizations have fought side by side in many battles against the undead and other forces of evil. Members of the churches of Selûne and Sune also view the Sun Soul monks as allies, but see the monks' ways as inscrutable and overly rigid. In Waterdeep, all three churches view the Order of the Sun Soul with suspicion because the local leader of the order has been preaching heresy, although the gods have yet to strike him down for doing so.

### Sun Soul Monk Lore

The Order of the Sun Soul is closely affiliated with the church of Lathander and loosely affiliated with the churches of Selûne and Sune. Characters who succeed on a Knowledge (religion) check can learn the following information, including the information from lower DCs:

DC 10: The Order of the Sun Soul is a widely scattered sect encompassing worshipers of the Morninglord, the Moonmaiden, and Lady Firehair.

DC 13: Monks of the Sun Soul Order are dedicated servants of the common folk, a tradition stretching back many generations.

DC 20: Monks of the Sun Soul Order can visibly manifest their spirits in the form of light or fire. According to their teachings, everyone harbors a tiny piece of the golden, life-giving sun in his or her soul.

DC 30: The Order of the Sun Soul dates back to the time of Netheril. The order, once known as the Brotherhood of the Sun, evolved into its current form after the death of Amaunator.

The Order of the Sun Soul is not particularly secretive, but a great deal of confusion surrounds its teachings because of its division into three sects, each venerating a different deity. Even members of the order are often unaware that the order once served the church of Amaunator.

---

### Sun Soul Monks in the Game

The Order of the Sun Soul is well suited for PC monks and monk/paladins. Even if none of the PCs belong to the brotherhood, the order is always seeking out lost Netherese religious lore and individual sects regularly hire adventurers to recover lost texts believed to date back to the order's earliest days.

The Sun Soul monk appeals to players who like to roleplay virtuous, athletic characters with a dash of magic, flash, and mystery. Make sure you provide ample opportunity for the Sun Soul monk to shine in unarmed combat, perhaps by pitting her against a monk of a rival order.

NPC Sun Soul monks typically inhabit monasteries hidden in far-flung wilderness areas but spend much of their time wandering the Realms while serving the common folk. Some members of the order are assigned to prominent temples of Lathander, Selime, or Sune, and thus they make their home within the major cities of Faerûn.

### Adaptation

While the Sun Soul monk is presented as loosely affiliated with three churches concerned with the heavens, you could easily adapt the class to other gods. For example, if the order were affiliated with Auril, you could change the allowed alignments to LN and LE, replace the flaming and flaming burst abilities with frost and icy burst, change fire shield to the chill version, and replace the searing ray ability with shivering touch ${ }^{\mathrm{P} 8}$.

### Encounters

Sun Soul monks are most likely encountered as allies of the PCs, particularly when the characters are searching for the legacies of ancient Netheril. On occasion, Sun Soul monks might clash with the PCs over possession of a religious text dating back to the order's earliest days.

EL 10: Righteous Sister Kadila adh Vitendi was born in Teshburl, the illegitimate daughter of Mond el Vitendi, now the Sultan of Teshburl, and a jhasina (harem slave). She was raised in the harem and trained as a jhasina before her father sold her to a distant cousin in Memnon. While crossing the Calim Desert, bandits attacked the caravan she was in, and Kadila fled in the confusion. Working as a courtesan in taverns and inns along the way, Kadila made it to Waterdeep, the legendary city of the North she remembered from her mother's tales.

Initially, Kadila sought refuge in the House of Sune, the fairhaired goddess venerated by her mother. There she encountered Hanor Kichavo, Monastic Abbot of the Sun Soul Order. Naturally slim, graceful, and athletic and in search of something in which  
to believe, Kadila found herself drawn to the disciplined life of a Sun Soul monk. Given a chance to thrive, she rapidly ascended in rank, and she is now second only to Hanor himself in authority.

Kadila adh Vitendi: Female Calishite human expert 2/monk 4/Sun Soul monk 5; CR 10; Medium humanoid; HD 2d6+2 plus 9d8+9; hp 62; Init +3 ; Spd 60 ft ; AC 20, touch 17, flat-footed 17; Base Atk +7 ; Grp +9 ; Atk +11 melee ( $1 \mathrm{~d} 10+3$, unarmed strike) or +10 melee ( $1 \mathrm{~d} 6+2$, masterwork silver light mace); Full Atk $+11 /+11 /+6$ melee ( $1 \mathrm{~d} 10+3$, unarmed strike with flurry of blows) or $+10 /+10 /+5$ melee ( $1 \mathrm{~d} 6+2$, masterwork silver light mace); SA flaming fists 1/day, ki strike (magic), sun soulray 2/day; SQ abundant step 1/day, evasion, low-light vision, slow fall 20 ft ., still mind, sun soul 5/day; AL LG; SV Fort +6 , Ref +11 , Will +14 ; Str 14, Dex 16, Con 12, Int 8, Wis 16, Cha 10.

Abundant Step (Su): Once per day Kadila can magically slip between spaces as if using the spell dimension door (caster level 4th).

Evasion (Ex): No damage on successful Reflex saving throw.  
Flaming Fists (Su): Once per day as a swift action (see page 80), Kadila can give her unarmed strike the flaming weapon special ability for 3 rounds.

Slow Fall (Ex): A monk within arm's reach of a wall can use it to slow her descent while falling. Kadila takes damage as if the fall were 20 feet shorter than it actually is.

Still Mind (Ex): +2 bonus on saves against spells and effects of the enchantment school.

Sun Soul (Sp): Kadila can use daylight five times per day (caster level 9th, duration 9 minutes). She must choose herself as the object from which the light emanates.

Sun Soulray (Sp): Kadila can use searing light two times per day (caster level 9th).

Possessions: bracers of armor +3 , amulet of mighty fists +1 , masterwork light mace, gloves of Dexterity +2 , potion of barkskin, potion of cat's grace, 2 potions of cure light wounds.

![img-16.jpeg](assets/City%20of%20Splendors,%20Waterdeep_img-16.jpeg)

Ihe City of Splendors is sprawling, bustling metropolis. Although some fixtures remain unchanged for centuries, others last for less than a tenday. The following is a brief overview of the more permanent locations in Waterdeep. While hundreds of locations are noted below, most are left for the Dungeon Master to define, as best befits the campaign.

### System of Wards

Since the Year of Falling Stars (1037 DR), Waterdeep has been divided for the purposes of governance and security into a system of wards or civic districts. Although no formal boundaries mark their borders, the six recognized wards of Waterdeep are Castle Ward, Dock Ward, North Ward, Sea Ward, Southern Ward, and Trades Ward. The City of the Dead is nearly a seventh ward unto itself, and Deepwater Harbor and the surrounding islands form an informal eighth ward.

The map on page 93 shows the wards of the city and the boundaries between them. Other maps in this chapter are enlargements of sections of the ward map.

### Waterdeep Structures

Buildings in the city are detailed in the following format:  
Map Key: Name (usage, building class, \# of floors)

### Building Class

Building class is an artificial categorization of structures into one of four groups (described below), sufficient to allow the DM to describe the building on the fly.

Class A Buildings: Class A buildings are always unique and distinctive landmarks of any scale. Most, however, are of a large and grandiose nature, almost built as much for show as for use. Examples include the city's public structures, major temples, and the nobles' villas.

Class B Buildings: Class B buildings cover the larger, more successful and elaborate single buildings within the city. They have up to six stories, and might have extensive cellars (usually connected to the sewers at some point). Most inns and guildhalls fall into this class. Examples include grand houses and mansions, prosperous businesses, large warehouses, and the guildhalls.

Class C Buildings: The great majority of buildings in Waterdeep are Class C-the tall row houses that line the streets to heights up to five stories. Row houses usually have shops on the ground floor, with zzffices or apartments above that. While not always multi-story row houses, this class includes many of the better-kept taverns and rooming houses in the city as well.

Class D Buildings: Class D buildings are lesser buildings, usually one-story wooden buildings used as small warehouses, individual homes, and storage sheds for Waterdeep's lower classes. Such buildings are mainly found in Dock Ward, southernmost Castle Ward, and, in smaller numbers, in Southern Ward and Trades Ward.

### Sea Ward

Waterdeep's wealthiest ward is notable for the many-spired, grand homes of the nobility, the gleaming edifices of the city's leading temples, and the imposing towers of the city's premier wizards. Other notable landmarks include the Field of Triumph (\$77), the lush Heroes' Garden (\$70), and the Sea's Edge Beach.

### Sea's Edge Beach

Originally just an area of mud flats on the city's western seaside, the area south of the West Gate (\$72) has been covered with sand and turned into a beachfront. While only used as such at the height of summer when water temperatures rise to near-tolerable

---

levels, Sea's Edge Beach is also used for reflection, solitude, and as the terminus of Auril's Blesstide Cliffs Run.

### Heroes' Garden (\$70)

Waterdeep's only public park outside the City of the Dead is a large, lush area of grass, trees, and ponds once covered by the sprawling school of wizardry known as the Tower of Yintros. A number of, statues decorate the area, including large marble statues to the Open Lords Baeron and Lhestyn (in her guise as the Masked Lady). It is often the scene of adventurers retelling tales of their exploits to others and attendant local children. The watch and the local citizenry tend to the park, which means they keep the park free of debris and prevent would-be heroes from carving their names into the trees. (The Company of Crazed Venturers did so anyway several decades back.)

The Catacombs of Yintros (see page 115) lie beneath Heroes' Garden.

### Field of Triumph (\$77)

This huge open-air stadium is the site of many spectacles staged for the populace of Waterdeep. From late spring to late autumn, thousands of people flood through the awe-inspiring Lion Gate to witness shows of magic, martial skills, horse races, and monstrous exhibitions of creatures big and small. The Field also acts as a public forum for such important public events as the Open Lord's proclamations to the city and special gatherings for foreign dignitaries.

### North Ward

Waterdeep's quietest ward is also one of its wealthiest. North Ward is home to most of the middle class and lesser noble families. This ward has few notable landmarks other than the Cliffwatch, and it all but shuts down at dusk. This placid reputation belies the intrigues and scheming that goes on behind closed

## Ward Map

doors, and the volumes of smuggled goods that lie in cellars beneath the city streets.

### CliffWatch

This sheer 100 -foot cliff presents a beautiful view of the countryside east and south of Waterdeep, and it provides a valuable defense against invading orcs and trolls. Guards in Endcliff Tower (N80) and the Watchway Tower (CD11) carefully watch the cliff's edge, which is unobstructed by walls or rails.

### The Grinning Lion (N\$6)

Tucked away inside a block of homes and businesses, this place, adorned with (faked) battle trophies from all over Faerûn, is as raucous as taverns get in North Ward. An old joke claims the Riven Shield Shop (T4) sends all shields beyond repair to hang on the walls here.

The music is loud, with male and female dancers in fantastically styled and revealing mock armor swaying and pirouetting among the tables. Real, if broken, weapons hang on the walls everywhere, so bouncers swiftly discourage any disputes. Folk come here to drink zzar and wine and eat fried onions and eels.

The proprietor is Unger Farshal (NE male Tethyrian human fighter 8), and regulars in attendance include Hala Myrt (an agent of Lord Orlpar Husteem; see page 90) and Vlorn Keenear (see page 72 ).

### Castle Ward

Castle Ward lies in the heart of Waterdeep, wrapping around the eastern slopes of Mount Waterdeep. This ward is home to the city's administrative buildings and buildings of state. The ward's most prominent landmarks include Ahghairon's Tower (C79), Blackstaff Tower (C6), Castle Waterdeep (C76), Piergeiron's Palace (C7Y), the Market, and Mirt's Mansion (CY2).

### Fetlock Court

This large paved courtyard adjoining the Palace paddocks and stables is the staging area for any mounted contingent of the guard before they head out of the city for outlying patrols. It has also become an impromptu concert area for practicing bards, who prefer it to their chilly quarters at New Olamn (C72).

### The Market

The largest open space in the city is an open marketplace surrounded by stone buildings (many moneylenders and pawnshops among them) that enclose the maze of temporary stalls and carts that appear here day and night. The Market is the best place to haggle for the lowest prices on almost any trade good imaginable, though there's no guarantee of finding anything.

### Mount Waterdeep

The mountain on which the city is built is a bald, rough crag with a peak some 1,500 feet above sea level. A lookout tower and griffon-steed eyrie sit atop this mountain. On its seaward flanks are emplaced eleven gigantic triple-catapults for hurling loads of rock and burning material out to sea against attacking ships. Several sea caves pierce the base of its western flank, connecting it to Undermountain and various points under the city by tunnels of great antiquity (once used for smuggling). The City Guard now watches these sea caves, allowing the Lords to use them for secretive operations. The South Seacave is connected by a set of hoists down into the mountain to the River Sargauth and Skullport.

### The Cynosure (C7)

In the immediate aftermath of Myrkul's defeat and the ascension of Midnight and Cyric, many Waterdhavians heard the voice of Ao over Mount Waterdeep. Within a month, a marble temple known as the "Temple of the Overgod" was built upon the ruins of Trader's Way (the site of Myrkul's death) with the enthusiastic support of Waterdeep's guilds and noble houses. Many worshipers flocked to the temple, including many nobles intent on following what seemed the latest fashion. Yet, after six months, the temple's flock was reduced by both mortal and divine disinterest. Soon, the temple was empty save for a few sporadic services. In the Year of the Serpent ( 1359 DR), the Lords of Waterdeep annexed the temple building and put it to use as a public hall, available for rent by nobles and wealthy merchants for parties, balls, weddings, and other events. Now carved into the frieze is "The Cynosure," a name both apt and ironic given the existence of the plane of the same name and the purpose it serves as the meeting place for the gods.

The ground on which the Cynosure was built falls within Myrkul's Ruins, so named for the brown murk that settled on the area after Myrkul's disintegration during the Time of Troubles. Although the Watchful Order of Magists \& Protectors cleaned up much of the fall-out of the destruction of the Lord of Bones, Myrkul's Ruins remain the site of a seemingly permanent planar breach, linking Faerûn to the Fugue Plane. The minor planar breach has allowed the Fugue Plane's impeded magic trait (all spells are impeded; Spellcraft DC $20+$ level to cast) to leech into this area. As word of this phenomenon has spread, many powerful spellcasters have chosen to hold negotiations in the, as it is seen as relatively "neutral ground" by those skilled in the Art.

### New Olamn (C72)

In just a few short years, New Olamn has become a prominent center of education and bardcraft in Waterdeep and up and down the Sword Coast. It can be reached by means of the Cliffride, a steep, treacherous gravel track that runs along the western edge of Mount Waterdeep's northern spur and is constantly exposed to the sea winds and spray of the ocean below. A more pleasant path passes through Mount Melody Walk, a continual flame-lit tunnel dug through Mount.Waterdeep's northern spur and staffed by a four-person contingent of the Guard at all times.

### Piergeiron's Palace (C75)

Built in the Year of the Smoky Moon ( 1287 DR), the white marble Palace of Waterdeep, now commonly known as Piergeiron's Palace, still stands as a shining symbol of the Lords' Rule, unblemished by corruption. The Palace is the main office location for many city officials, the majority of which are dedicated to the administration of city services, such as the Watch, the Guard, city clerks, and the Loyal Order of Street Laborers. The Lords' Court meets in a large chamber on the second floor, just up the grand staircase from the echoing, open entry hall.

There are also embassies here from many other countries and cities, although such embassies need not be located in the Palace. The most elaborate embassy in the Palace is the Silverymoon Embassy, with a portal to Alüstriel's Court.

Piergeiron's lodgings occupy the two northern towers of the northern wing of the Palace. Also in the northern wing are various guest quarters for visiting dignitaries without a separate embassy in the city. Secret tunnels run from Piergeiron's chambers to all the private meeting places of the Lords, including Blackstaff Tower (C6).

### Castle Waterdeep (C76)

Waterdeep's great fortress is a thick-walled stronghold that broods over Castle Ward from the flanks of Mount Waterdeep. Pennants and banners are often hung and flown from its battlements to signal the arrival of diplomats or the commencement of ceremonies. The great height of the castle walls makes such signs readily visible in the southern half of the city. The castle's walls average sixty feet thick, with rooms and passages tunneled out of their great bulk.

The castle can house approximately three thousand Mediumsize creatures in comfort, and three times that number if every

corner is used for accommodation and storage. The normal garrison is fourteen hundred city guards. Dungeon levels beneath the city hold ninety cells in total, each capable of holding up to six prisoners. By edict of the Lords, the castle's larder must contain an emergency food supply large enough to feed fifty thousand people for a tenday. The castle courtyard is used for training members of the Guard and the Watch. The main stables, containing seyenty or so fully trained and equipped warhorses, are located in the ground-level interior of the castle's south wall.

Signal beacons, horns, and mighty catapults capable of commanding the entire harbor of Waterdeep as far as Deepwater Isle and the Torchtowers are kept ready on the battlements. A garrison unit of at least thirty armed soldiers of the Guard always stands watch. The castle gates and all stations of the walls are always guarded, and just within the gates is a duty guardroom where a strike squad of twenty crossbowmen and two wizards can reinforce the guards at the gate in seconds, and anywhere else in or under the castle in minutes.

Castle Waterdeep is linked to extensive dungeons beneath the castle and in the mountain to the west, used as armories, food-stores, and to hold Waterdeep's secrets. Beneath the castle's dungeons lies the Citadel of the Bloody Hand (see page 116), now a dangerous, festering sore on the castle's integrity.

### Trades Ward

Trades Ward lies in the eastern half of Waterdeep, encircling the western and southern walls of the City of the Dead. Given over almost entirely to commerce, Trades Ward lacks the feeling of community found in the more residential wards, but retains the hustle and bustle of a marketplace throughout the day and night. Notable landmarks of Trades Ward include the Court of the White Bull, the Plinth (T38), and Virgin's Square.

### Court of the White Bull

This place is a packed-dirt plaza named for the birth of an albino calf on this site when it lay outside the city walls. The calf's owner eventually built the White Bull tavern, which thrived for years until destroyed by Thongalar the Mighty and Shile Rauretilar in a great spell battle that tore a rapidly widening planar breach to the Astral Plane. Azuth, god of mages, repaired the breach, but this area intermittently acquires the planar trait of wild magic. As a result, no one has ever dared build on the location, making it a natural meeting place and market for caravan owners to peddle their wares from wagons.

### The Plinth (T38)

Once a wizard's tower and the center of Selünite worship in Waterdeep, the Plinth is now a temple open to any faith and employed by worshipers of gods who lack sizable congregations in the City of Splendors. This mighty, needlelike tower resembles a tall, thin, pyramid with the top cut off. Small balconies spiral around the tower in slow descent. City laws forbid the sacrifice of intelligent beings to any god, but a lot of folk leap (or are "helped" to fall) from these heights each year. The flat roof is often used as a landing place for aerial steeds by the city's wealthy and powerful.

### Virgin's Square

This market and traditional hiring place for warriors is named for a local legend that virgins were sacrificed to dragons on this spot, long before the founding of Waterdeep. Whenever Cult of the Dragon agents visit the city, this is their traditional meeting place.

### City of the Dead

This walled enclosure on the eastern edge of Trades Ward is the general cemetery for the City of Splendors, and its size nearly makes it a ward in and of itself. Many citizens visit the City of the Dead's parklike green lawns and white marble tombs during the day, for it is one of the few places dominated by greenery that the citizens of Waterdeep can share within the city walls. A Watch contingent keeps the cemetery peaceful, and various members of the Guild of Chandlers and Lamplighters keep torches lit around and inside a number of the tombs. The grounds are off-limits after dusk, and the gates are locked. Nevertheless, many individuals still hold clandestine meetings at night in the City of the Dead, despite the slight risk of undead escaping from a warded tomb to prowl the sprawling cemetery.

Although it has only been in its current form since the Year of the Riven Skull ( 1250 DR), the area has served as the city burial ground for centuries. The cemetery ran out of room in the Year of the Stranger ( 1064 DR), prompting the city to build a low wall around it and replace the individual graves with magic tombs linked by portals (constructed primarily by the mage Anacaster) to infinite demiplanes. Two years later, the high number of undead prompted the Lords to erect higher, defensible walls around the cemetery and to lock and ward the magic tombs. There have been few incidents since.

### Roads' End (CD1)

This small tomb is the final resting place for travelers who die while in the city. Any unclaimed possessions are interred with  
their remains (minus any outstanding debts, including their burial costs). This tomb has always been a frequent target for thieves, usually following rumors of rich adventurers being buried with great magic and gold.

### The House of the Homeless (CD2)

This is a vast mausoleum with a row of low steps leading up to its high metal gates. Anacaster's portal (an opaque energy-filled arch at the end of the echoing, empty entry hall) leads to an apparently endless labyrinth of underground caverns. The city pays the Guild of Chandlers \& Lamplighters to light these caverns. Here lie all the dead of Waterdeep who do not merit, or do not own, a place in any other tomb. If their names are known, such are always cut into the rock above the hole where their cremated ashes are interred.

### Ahghairon's Statue (CD3)

This tall, marble sculpture is an incredibly lifelike depiction of the bearded, robed mage as he appeared at age seventy (his prime). Ahghairon stands atop concentric steps, facing west with his hands outstretched to indicate the City of Waterdeep around him, with a smile on his face. The steps are lit by night with rows of torches and are a favorite meeting spot by day.

### Merchants' Rest (CD4)

Also known as "the Coinscoffin," this resting place is reserved for those who prepay for the honor of burial here. The tomb contains one of Anacaster's portals, which leads to a lightly wooded region with inset plaques on the ground, marking burial plots.

### Warriors' Monument (CD5)

This is a 60 -foot-high impressive stone sculpture depicting a circle of three men and two women striking down trolls, goblinoids, orcs, and barbarians, all of whom are falling backward-outward-all around them. After the Time of Troubles, the statue was renovated and magically altered to add a griffon-rider flying above the other warriors and spearing a minion of Myrkul.

### Lords' Respite (CD6)

This small, black marble tomb is the final resting place of those Lords who wish to be buried in state. It is fronted on three sides by statues of the Open Lords-Ahghairon (north), Baeron (east), and Lhestyn (south). There is no statue on the western face, but there is a door apparently made of the same smoky material as the Lords' belms, which prevents any from seeing or entering the inside of the tomb. Only one Lord has been buried here in the past three decades, and the identities of all buried Lords remain secret even in death, as bodies interned herein are buried in full Lords' regalia.

### The Hall of the Sages (CD7)

This is a special tomb for sages-a small, dusty tomb with only about eighty sages interred inside. What makes it interesting to some illicit treasure hunters is the rumor that many of the sages' rarest tomes and books were interred with their cremated remains (a false rumor maintained by Laeral and others to flush out dealers of forbidden lore).

### The Hall of Heroes (CD8)

This is the official warriors' tomb of Waterdeep, for fighters and all who fall in battle. Its blue marble walls enclose a trophy hall with many remembrances of the fallen, including the sword hilt of Raurlor (its blade long since turned to the skeleton of an asp). At the far end of the hall is one of Anacaster's portals, leading to pleasant rolling fields on an "empty," grassy plane, where the warriors are buried, row upon row.

### Deepwinter Vault (CD10)

Deepwinter Vault is the long-neglected tomb of the nowvanished Deepwinter family. It also contains the primary entrance to the Dungeon of the Crypt (see page 118).

### SULTLUE VAULT (CD14)

In the depths of this heavily warded tomb slumbers Sylsinssath Sultlue (CE male yuan-ti pureblood sorcerer 9/ancient master ${ }^{2 k}$ 3) of House Eselemas. Driven from Lushpool by his cousin and greatest rival, he settled in Waterdeep over a century ago and quickly rebuilt his fortunes. Members of House Sultlue make regular visits to this tomb to attend to his needs, and a small band of tainted ones ${ }^{2 k}$ actually dwell within the tomb.

### Dock Ward

Waterdeep's most notorious and colorful ward is also the oldest. Traveler's tales portray it as a lawless, brawling place of drunks, smugglers, roaming monsters, and fell magic, which is not all that far from the truth. The bustling harbor scene and its attendant activities dominate this ward.

### The WarRens

Beneath the heart of Dock Ward lies one of Waterdeep's lesserknown neighborhoods. Reachable through narrow winding tunnels leading off various dark alleys, the Warrens have been centuries in the making, starting with ancient stone houses built along hilly streets. From time to time a higher floor has been added to a building, or a walkway built to add living space or to connect houses, even those across a street from each other. Over time, parts of streets have been completely hidden from  
the sun, and the lowest floors of many buildings have become cellars. Subsequent rebuildings have shored up the lowest inhabited floors and worked from there. The slow result of Waterdeep's reach for the grander and larger and taller is the forgotten layer known as the Warrens, home to many of Waterdeep's small folk. Many gnomes, halflings, and even the occasional dwarves have found congenial and discreet housing amid the dark cellars and narrow tunnels, for stout halfling warriors guard most entrances, keeping the Warrens free of humans and their ilk.

### The Keelhauled Dwarf

In the cavernous cellar beneath the warehouse known as the House of Tarmagus (D30) lies The Keelhauled Dwarf, a subterranean tavern favored by duergar and their ilk, as well as many of the city's half-orcs, thugs, and ruffians.

### The Monster Pit

Beneath the Fishscale Smithy (D60) building and the neighboring Thirsty Sailor (D12) lies an abandoned gladiatorial arena once owned (indirectly) by Elaith Craulnober. Various Dock Ward gangs sometimes use the place for settling their differences.

### The Old Xoblob Shop (D71)

This curiosity shop is filled with lots of battle trophies and souvenirs from Undermountain. The shop is untidy and ill-organized but worth a look, if only to see the stuffed beholder for which the shop is named (hanging by the main counter). The proprietor, Dundalus Ruell, loves to tell the tale of his victory over Old Xoblob.

### South Ward

Once known as Temple Ward, Southern Ward lies in the southeastern corner of Waterdeep, bounded by Trades Ward to the north and Dock Ward to the west. Caravan City, as this oft-forgotten ward is sometimes known, is a homely, friendly, busy, and largely poor area of Waterdeep. Notable landmarks of Southern Ward include Caravan Court and Waymoot.

### Caravan Court

This place is usually a dust-shrouded melee of cursing, whipwielding drovers, bawling beasts of burden, and creaking wagons and carts. Most caravans entering or leaving through the Southern Gate muster or disband in Caravan Court, making it a scene of nonstop activity and chaos.

### Waymoot

At the southern intersection of the High Road and the Way of the Dragon, the Waymoot is a high signpost mounted in the middle of the crossroads with hanging arrows pointing toward the harbor and city gates. Created by the Watchful Order and funded by local merchants, the signpost magically directs travelers to locations spoken into a crystal on the post. Once a site is spoken, the Waymoot writes the destination onto the relevant arrow and indicates is distance from Waterdeep; therefore folk are sent out the appropriate gate leading north, east, or south, depending on their destinations.

### Deepwater Harbor

The naturally sheltered, deepwater basin that gives Waterdeep both its name and its wealth is a bustling place. Its chill waters are kept fairly clean by the diligent work of the Guild of Watermen and the merfolk of Tharqualnaar. The mariners of the

Guard control access to the harbor above the waves, using the retractable chain-nets and walls of the defensible harbor to bar entrance or exit by particular ships.

Deepwater Harbor is divided into two smaller harbors-the Great Harbor, through which commerce and transportation flows, and the Naval Harbor, restricted for the use of the navy. Two major islands, Stormhaven and Deepwater, enclose the harbor. Notable landmarks include Boatscrape Cove, where ships are beached to be cleaned of barnacles and worse; Deepwater Beach, where mermaids often come to sun and flirt with the guards; the Sea Stacks, sharp rocks that deter the close approach of sailing ships; and Umberlee's Cache, the subsea depression that leads to flooded caverns in the depths. (See page 120 for more information on Umberlee's Cache.)

Waterdeep's sewers empty into the harbor at places covered with extremely large and strong gratings, regulárly patrolled by bands of merfolk. The merfolk use catch-nets on poles to scoop and gather the debris into large tow-globes for transport far out to sea. The harbor's rocky, sloping bottom is thinly covered with mud, especially at the southern end of the harbor. It is kept free of plants and litter by the merfolk. Due to the cleanliness of the harbor and the undersea lighthouse known as

---

Deepwater Beacon (H7), there are no penalties to Spot checks beneath the harbor's surface.

### Underwater Residents

The Great Harbor is home to two communities-the merfolk village of Tharqualnaar and the sea elf hamlet of T'Quession. Both communities suffered horribly during the Deepwater War, but their numbers have rebounded thanks to an influx of refugees from other communities devastated by the Army of Iakhovas. Locathah sometimes come to the harbor to trade, as do other merfolk, but lizardfolk and sahuagin are slain on sight.

### Deepwater Beacon (H7)

This underwater lighthouse stands at the edge of Umberlee's Cache (see page 120), lit by a magical light which guides the merfolk patrols and keeps the sea wraiths confined within the caverns below. The light is actually the terminus of a one-way portal from a point high above the atmosphere through which sunlight pours twenty-four hours a day. The lighthouse serves the merfolk as a tethering spot for giant seahorse steeds, as an armory, and as a storage facility. It also serves ships above by acting as a subsurface beacon.

### Communities within

Although Waterdeep is a city in its own right, it contains three settlements within its borders sufficiently distinct to be considered communities of their own.

### Skullport

Skullport is a subterranean community on the banks of the River Sargauth in the depths of Undermountain's third level. Built atop the ruins of the Sargauth Enclave, the Port of Shadow has long been the dark mirror of Waterdeep's fair face. The Lords of Waterdeep have long tolerated Skullport's existence, reasoning correctly that if they were to destroy the Port of Shadow, the sinister commerce of the place would inevitably migrate upward to the city proper, despoiling the City of Splendors. However, the Lords do keep a close eye on activities within Skullport, predominantly through the efforts of Laeral and "Kitten" (see page 54).

Skullport serves as a smuggling and trading base for stolen and illegal cargo in the City of Splendors. Body parts, cadavers, drugs, ask-no-questions mercenaries, slaves, evil and vile magic, poisons, and almost anything else can be found for sale in its dark ways. Aside from the community's location and Skull Isle,  
the most notable feature of the Port of Shadow are its inhabitants-beholders, gargoyles, illithids, drow, vampires, and all manner of terrible monsters.

Skullport has no government per se, although the various competing power groups form a fluid oligarchy of sorts, with disputes resolved outside the town through proxies. The Skulls of Skullport, remnants of the Netherese wizards who once ruled the Sargauth Enclave, keep what peace exists. Shradin Mulophor is the nominal lord of Skullport, harkening back to an ancient agreement with Halaster, but since his transformation during Halaster's Higharvestide, he has exercised little actual authority. His clone has largely retreated within his manse, ignoring all else.

Other important power groups in Skullport include the Agents of the Eye, the Arcane Brotherhood, the Chosen of Eilistrace (from the nearby Promenade of Eilistrace, UM L3), the Dark Dagger, the drow of House Tanor'Thal, duergar from Gracklstugh, the Harpers, the illithids of Ch'Chitl, the Iron Ring, the Keepers, the Kraken Society, the Lords of Waterdeep, various Skulker gangs, and the Unseen.

### The Skulls of Skullport

The Skulls for which the Port of Shadow is named are the sentinels of order in an otherwise dangerous community. The true nature of the Skulls has been a mystery since the port's founding, but their authority has never been successfully challenged since the arrival of Shradin Mulophor in the Year of the Angry Sea ( 1148 DR ). The Skulls are possessed of a strange, alien intellect and are known to speak in cryptic phrases and ancient tongues long since vanished from the Realms. The Skulls often make bizarre demands of those who cross their paths or otherwise attract their attention, and their reaction to events is unpredictable.

The true history of the Skulls is known only to Halaster and a few of his apprentices. At the exact moment that the Weave faltered in the Year of Sundered Webs ( -339 DR ), the Netherese arcanists of the Sargauth Enclave were experimenting with the

---

great mythal that encompassed their subterranean city. As surges of wild magic wracked the mythal, the arcanists were drawn into the magical mantle that enveloped their city. The thirteen most powerful arcanists were transformed into the Skulls of Skullport and trapped within the ruined city, while their apprentices were trapped within the twisted remnants of the mythal in the form of spellshades (treat each as CN flameskull ${ }^{1,2}$ sorcerer 9 with a rainbow hued, vaguely humanoid-shaped body).

In the centuries that followed, the thirteen Skulls lurked within the ruins of their shattered enclave, unable to move more than 300 feet beyond the cavern that now houses the Port of Shadow. The mythal that held the Skulls in thrall allowed their thoughts to mingle, and over time the thirteen Skulls lost their individual identities and developed a collective consciousness that retained only fragments of its constituent personalities. While each Skull still exhibited odd habits, pet peeves, and even the occasional bit of skill or wisdom reminiscent of its original personality, for all intents and purposes the Skulls became a single entity. The spellshades found themselves incapable of manifesting at all except when summoned by the Skulls.

Shortly after his arrival in Undermountain in the Year of Scattered Stars ( 168 DR), Halaster Blackcloak discovered the ruins of the Sargauth Enclave, but he wisely retreated, correctly perceiving the threat posed by the Skulls. Halaster has never set foot within the ruined enclave, and he has always barred his apprentices from doing the same. Shradin Mulophor ignored Halaster's vague  
warnings and received the Mad Mage's permission to claim the ruins for his own. The Lord of Bones forged a pact with the Skulls that enabled him to establish a small trading settlement in the cavern. The Skulls agreed to Shradin's request not out of boredom or whimsy, as the necromancer suspected, but because his plans dovetailed with their own plans to escape their ancient prison. As Skullport grew, the Skulls learned to absorb and empower wizards they killed, transforming them into flameskulls ${ }^{1,2}$. Not every arcane spellcaster was susceptible to absorption into the mantle, but enough were to create a great number of vassal skulls.

During the Time of Troubles ( 1358 DR), Halaster's control of Undermountain's wards wavered for the first time, and the Skulls were briefly able to tap into a portion of his power. The unlucky victim of their newfound prowess was a visiting drow archmage. The Rag Mage, as he came to be known, was transformed into his current form (insane CN male drow sorcerer 15/archmage 4 attended by a closet of common raggamoffyns ${ }^{M M 3}$ ), capable of feeding Skullport's mantle by slowly bleeding magical and life energies of victims of his servitor raggamoffyns. The wards of Undermountain faltered again on Halaster's Higharvestide ( 1369 DR) when the Mad Mage was abducted from his halls by the Twisted Rune. The Skulls struck almost immediately, transforming Shradin into his current form (NE nishruu ${ }^{\mathrm{ME}}$ [augmented male human] necromancer 22/archmage 5), capable of feeding Skullport's mantle  
![img-26.jpeg](assets/City%20of%20Splendors,%20Waterdeep_img-26.jpeg)

the magic he absorbs. In the wake of these two successes, any two of the fifteen entities linked to the mythal (the thirteen Skulls, the Rag Mage, and Shradin) were able to escape the Port of Shadow. The Skulls became convinced that they only need link eleven other powerful arcane spellcasters to the mythal and they could escape once and for all.

Such ambitions were shattered just a few years later, when a powerful extraplanar entity named Vhostym tapped into Skullport's mythal with an artifact known as a Weave Tap. The ensuing destruction destroyed four of the Skulls, wreaked havoc in the Port of Shadow, and transformed the remaining Skulls into true undead. Once again the Skulls were trapped within the mythal, unable to depart (as were the Rag Mage and the Lord of Bones), but now they could send their spellshades and vassal flameskulls beyond the mythal into the halls of Undermountain. It is unclear how, if at all, the damage to Skullport's mythal has affected the balance of power within the Port of Shadow and between the Skulls and Halaster, but it is clear that the status quo on which Skullport was built has come to a rapid and unclear end.

The Skulls themselves can now be considered CN advanced 8 HD flameskulls. Collectively, they can tap into the spells of a sorcerer 26/archmage 5/Netherese arcanist ${ }^{50} 5$ (effectively a shared spell pool). Individually, they can cause spellshades and vassal flameskulls to manifest for 1 d 4 rounds or 1 d 4 hours, respectively. Skullport's mythal, in addition to functioning as a prison, acts like a lich's phylactery. As long as it survives unscathed, none of the Skulls can be truly destroyed.

### T'quession

The hamlet of T'Quesion is less than a decade old, having been formed by sea elf refugees from warmer southern waters in the Year of the Shield ( 1367 DR). The Fair Folk were driven from their homes by a huge horde of undersea predators, the vanguard of the Army of Iakhovas. The survivors settled in Waterdeep's harbor alongside the merfolk of Tharqualnaar and petitioned Waterdeep's Lords to join the Guard. Like the merfolk, the sea elves fought long and hard in defense of Waterdeep during the Deepwater War and paid a high toll for their efforts. In the years since that battle, many additional sea elves have migrated to the relative safety of Waterdeep's harbor, and the community is beginning to grow.

Like the merfolk of Tharqualnaar, sea elves who join the Guard receive a healthy stipend from the Lords. However, most of the Fair Folk seem to prefer the role of merchants, selling the fruits of the seas to surface dwellers at the Sea Elf Trading Outpost (H6), just outside Waterdeep's walls.

T'Quesion (Hamlet, Conventional): AL CG; Spending limit 100 gp; Assets 1,200 gp; Population 240; Races isolated (sea elves 230 , merfolk 5 , half-sea elves 2 , others 3 ).

Authority Figure: Ni'saheensa Elanar (CG female sea elf ranger 14 [Deep Sashelas]).

Important Characters: Rellindaer of Lantan (CG male halfsea elf expert 9), many others (too numerous to list here).

Notable Exports: All manner of undersea trade goods, most of them produced by other undersea races.

### Tharqualnaar

The village of Tharqualnaar is a community of merfolk older than Waterdeep itself, dating back to the Year of Sea Monsters $(-458 \mathrm{DR})$. For centuries, detachments of male merfolk have been sent north from warmer southern waters to the flooded sea caves beneath what is now known as Deepwater Isle. Members of the merfolk garrison kept watch over the tithes to Umberlee that littered the cavern floor, hoping to keep thieves from provoking the Bitch Queen's ire and the inevitable ensuing destruction above and below the surface all along the Sword Coast. Since the Year of Three Seas' Rage ( -334 DR ), that duty has necessitated keeping watch over Umberlee's Cache (see page 120) and the burgeoning number of sea wraiths and other monsters of the depths that dwell within.

In the Year of the Harp ( 1355 DR), merfolk fleeing the destruction of Laakos' Reef, a community in the Shining Sea forty miles east of Calimport, arrived in Deepwater Harbor seeking sanctuary from the looming threat of Iakhovas and offering their tralents in service to the Lords of Waterdeep. As they were accompanied by female and young merfolk, Tharqualnaar was transformed almost overnight from a remote military garrison into a thriving village. In the Year of the Gauntlet ( 1369 DR), the village was nearly destroyed by the Army of Iakhovas, and the merfolk bore the brunt of the Deepwater War's undersea casualties. However, in the war's aftermath, refugees from up and down the Sword Coast migrated to Tharqualnaar and made it their home. Coupled with a generous donation of material and magic support from the Lords of Waterdeep, the merfolk village of Tharqualnaar has once again begun to thrive. The merfolk have even cultivated an undersea garden in a "hot rift" on the harbor floor near the eastern tip of Deepwater Isle.

All adult merfolk of Tharqualnaar are considered members of the City Guard if they contribute to the defense of Waterdeep, though their weaponry and equipment is their own. The Lords pay a stipend of food, medical supplies, and trade-bars (the equivalent of 25 gp per head per month) to all who loyally patrol the harbor depths against invaders, predators, and shipping hazards. The merfolk are expected to aid in the recovery of corpses, spilled cargo, sunken vessels, and the like. They are free to travel outside the harbor, but rarely patrol more than a quarter-mile from the western shore of Deepwater Isle or a half-mile north of Stormhaven Island.

Tharqualnaar (Village, Magical): AL LG, NG, LN, N; Spending limit 200 gp ; Assets 5,120 gp; Population 517; Races isolated (merfolk 492, sea elves 10, half-sea elves 10, others 5 ).

## ADVERTURES in WATERDEEP

Although Waterdeep makes a convenient sanctuary where player characters can lick their wounds, count their coins, and outfit themselves anew, it offers much more to those willing to seek adventure. Waterdeep can even be the basis of an entire campaign, spanning the entire range of adventuring possibilities and taking PCs from their first adventure to their last.

Waterdeep works well as a home base for a dungeon-delving campaign that ranges up and down the Sword Coast. Many neophyte adventurers make their way to the City of Splendors in search of companions of similar ilk. Almost anything can be bought or sold in Waterdeep or Skullport, making it easy to keep player characters comfortably equipped as they rise in power. In fact, it is not uncommon for characters based elsewhere in Faerûn to teleport into Waterdeep for supplies before returning to their home regions.

Waterdeep also works well as a "dungeon" in its own right. The City of Splendors sits atop the greatest dungeon of Faerûn (Undermountain), as well as hosting lesser sites such as the Citadel of the Bloody Hand and the Dungeon of the Crypt. Many monsters live in and among the people of Waterdeep-aboleth and skum lurk in the sewers, illithids and vampires prey on the populace, and beholders with legions of charmed servitors, shape-shifting dragons, and all manner of undead each pursue their own schemes. Player characters can find more than enough monsters to battle simply by exploring Waterdeep's scamy underside.

Finally, Waterdeep is the perfect setting for a campaign based on political intrigue. Strife between guilds, nobles, politicians, religious figures, rogues, and outside power groups can provide an endless font of roleplaying possibilities for players who prefer to focus on character interaction over dungeon exploration.

### Urban Dangers

Although Waterdeep is largely civilized and its population comprised primarily of allied humanoids (humans, dwarves, elves, halflings, gnomes, and others), its dangers are not confined to the dungeons and sewer's beneath the streets. Many sentient monstrous races uniquely adapted for urban hunting dwell in and among the citizenry of Waterdeep, including doppelgangers, ghaunadans ${ }^{\mathrm{M}}$, greater doppelgangers ${ }^{\mathrm{M}}$, malaugryms ${ }^{\mathrm{M}}$, wererats, and vampires. Lesser predators and pests such as dweomervores ${ }^{\circ}$, changesteed leucrottas ${ }^{\circ}$, fihyrs ${ }^{\mathrm{MM}}$, splinterwaifs ${ }^{\mathrm{MM}}$, and even wiloras ${ }^{\circ}$ are sometimes found in the city as well. (Dweomervores and wiloras are described in Chapter 6.)

Other urban dangers are more localized, dealt with by the locals through avoidance rather than confrontation. Of course, if foolhardy PCs blunder into such a place and manage to dispatch the persistent threat, everyone benefits. If not, the attitude of the local citizenry and Watch contingent is usually "well at least it wasn't a neighbor who vanished."

### Black Wagon Alley (el 3)

Running east of Book Street to the north of Candle Lane, this narrow way leads to a warren of houses inhabited by the poor (including some thieves). City Watch patrols are often busy cutting away trip-wires and strangle-wires from its more easterly stretches. It is named for the ghostly apparition of a black plaguewagon, which sometimes meanders through the alley, slowly and silently, without horses or a driver. Anyone who encounters this haunting must make a DC 16 Fortitude save or catch cackle fever (see page 292 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).

### Black well Court ( $\epsilon \mathrm{L}$ ?)

Opening west off Book Street, across from the end of Drakiir Street, this cramped courtyard is known for its long-polluted well of black water. It serves as the meeting place for many gangs of street ruffians, thugs, and cultists. As such, it is regularly patrolled by the Guard and the Watch, who often find thugs, Dragon

Cultists, or worshipers of Loviatar whipping an unfortunate victim kidnapped from somewhere nearby.

Rumors persist of something living in the well, coming out at night to snatch and feed on passersby. The rumors are true.

Qikna: Meazel ${ }^{\text {MF }}$ rogue $1 /$ assassin 2; CR 7; Medium monstrous humanoid; HD $4 \mathrm{~d} 8+4$ plus $1 \mathrm{~d} 6+1$ plus $2 \mathrm{~d} 6+1$; hp 38 ; Init +7 ; Spd 30 ft.; AC 17, touch 13, flat-footed 14; Base Atk $+5 ;$ Grp +7 ; Atk +9 melee ( $1 \mathrm{~d} 6+3 / 19-20,+1$ short sword) or +8 melee ( $1 \mathrm{~d} 4+2$ and disease, claw) or +8 ranged ( $1 \mathrm{~d} 8 / 19-20$, light crossbow); Full Atk +9 melee (1d6+3/19-20, +1 short sword) and +6 melee ( $1 \mathrm{~d} 4+1$ and disease, claw) or $+8 /+8$ melee ( $1 \mathrm{~d} 4+2$ and disease, 2 claws) or +8 ranged ( $1 \mathrm{~d} 8 / 19-20$, light crossbow); SA death attack, disease, poison use, sneak attack +5 d 6 ; SQ darkvision 60 ft ., evasion, trapfinding, uncanny dodge; AL CE; SV Fort +4 , Ref +12 , Will +4 ; Str 15 , Dex 16, Con 13, Int 10, Wis 10, Cha 4.

Skills and Feats: Disguise +1 , Hide +13 , Move Silently +13 , Spot +2 , Swim +6 , Tumble +7 ; Great Fortitude, Improved Initiative, Weapon Finesse.  
-Death Attack (Ex): If Qikna studies a victim for 3 rounds and then makes a sneak attack with a melee weapon that successfully deals damage, the sneak attack has the additional effect of possibly either paralyzing or killing the target (Qikna's choice). If the victim of such an attack fails a DC 12 Fortitude save, he is paralyzed for $1 \mathrm{~d} 6+2$ rounds or killed, as appropriate.

Disease (Su): Claw attack, Fort DC 13, incubation time 1d6 days, damage 1d2 Dex and 1d2 Con per day. Any victim that takes ability damage must succeed on a DC 13 Fortitude save or take 1 point of Dexterity drain and 1 point of Constitution drain instead of the normal damage for the disease.

Evasion (Ex): If Qikna is exposed to any effect that normally allows him to attempt a Reflex saving throw for half damage, he takes no damage with a successful saving throw.

Sneak Attack (Ex): Qikna does 5 d 6 extra points of damage on any successful attack against flat-footed or flanked targets, or against a target that has been denied its Dexterity bonus for any reason. This damage also applies to ranged attacks against targets up to 30 feet away. Creatures with concealment, creatures without discernible anatomies, and creatures immune to extra damage from critical hits are all immune to sneak attacks.

Trapfinding (Ex): Qikna can find, disarm, or bypass traps with a DC of 20 or higher. He can use the Search skill to find,  
and the Disable Device skill to disarm, magic traps (DC $25+$ the level of the spell used to create it). If his Disable Device result exceeds the trap's DC by 10 or more, he discovers how to bypass the trap without triggering or disarming it.

Uncanny Dodge (Ex): Qikna retains his Dexterity bonus to AC even when flat-footed or targeted by an unseen foe. He still loses his Dexterity bonus if paralyzed or otherwise immobile.  
'Possessions: +1 studded leather armor, +1 short sword, light crossbow, 20 bolts, greenblood oil ( 3 doses).

## Brindul Alley (EL 6)

This crescent-shaped alley lies between Sorn Street and River Street. It is a frequent haunt of a dangerous apparition, known as The Hand That Sings, which was seen more often near the docks in older days but has been in this new location for nearly two decades. The Hand appears to be an animated, severed human hand with a mouth in its palm-a strange apparition all too similar to the sign of cursed Moander, the ancient and evil god who never sleeps quite soundly enough. The Hand is said to snatch valuables it fancies-especially magic-when it encounters them, and to occasionally attack folk in the darkness, strangling them or tripping them into fatal falls. Most often, though, it seems to take no notice of those who do not bother or follow it, merely drifting along, eerily singing old and fragmentary Sword Coast ballads and love songs as it wanders through the night.

Unbeknownst to all, the Hand is actually a living combination of two spells: bandfang ${ }^{\text {bw }}$ and magic mouth. Fashioned by one of Halaster's apprentices long ago, it now wanders about Waterdeep, following the barely remembered dictates of its mad creator.

The Hand That Sings, Living Spell ${ }^{\text {MM }}$ : CR 6; Medium ooze; HD 5d10; hp 32; Init +1 ; Spd 20 ft.; AC 14, touch 11, flat-footed 13; Base Atk +3 ; Grp +5 ; Atk +5 melee ( $1 \mathrm{~d} 4+3$, slam); Full Atk +5 melee ( $1 \mathrm{~d} 4+3$, slam); Space/Reach 5 ft./5 ft.; SA engulf, spell effect; SQ damage reduction 10/magic, ooze traits, spell resistance 15 ; AL NE; SV Fort +3 , Ref +2 , Will +2 ; Str 15, Dex 12, Con 15, Int -, Wis 12, Cha 15.

Engulf (Ex): The Hand That Sings can flow around creatures that fit within its space as a standard action. It cannot make a slam attack during a round in which it engulfs. The living spell merely has to move over the opponents, affecting as many as it

---

can cover. Opponents can make attacks of opportunity against the Hand that Sings, but if they do so they are not entitled to a saving throw. Those who do not attempt attacks of opportunity must succeed on a DC 15 Reflex save or be engulfed; on a success, they are pushed back or aside (opponent's choice) as the spell moves forward. Engulfed creatures are subject to the full normal effect of the spell(s) each round on the living spell's turn, and are considered to be grappled.

Spell Effect (Su): A creature hit by the slam attack of the Hand that Sings is subjected to the normal effect of the spell or spells making up the creature, as if it were within the area or effect of the spell itself. Saves apply as normal for the spell (DC 15). The fanged, biting mouth deals 1d6 points of damage. With a successful DC 15 Reflex save, the victim takes only half damage, but if the target fails the Reflex save, the Hand that Sings automatically establishes a hold. Its teeth sink into the target's flesh and continue to bite for an extra 1d6 points of damage each round until the hold is broken or the spell ends. In addition, the fanged mouth delivers venom to a held foe, dealing 1d6 points of Constitution damage (initial and secondary) unless the target makes a successful DC 15 Fortitude save.

### Deloun Alley

Reached from Chelor's Alley, this back-of-the-shops delivery route is always crowded with crates, barrels, and the like. By night, rats of both the human and rodent sort lurk here-where crates can easily be thrown or used to block the escape of surprised victims. This alley serves as the informal headquarters of the Plague Rats (see page 57) in the City of Splendors.

### Lhestyn's Court (el 13)

Lhestyn's Court lies on the interior of the block of taverns and businesses bound on the south by Chasso's Trot and the High Road on the east. The main entrance to the Jhansczil Villa (\$14) faces the northern side of the barely visible entrance to the dark court. Many wrongly assume this was the spot upon which the Masked Lady (Lhestyn Silmaeril) died, but those aware of their city history know this is the area where one of the battles against the Shadow Thieves occurred in the Year of the Pointed Bone (1298 DR). Lhestyn led more than four dozen Shadow Thieves into ambushes within this court and she and her hidden allies killed all of them over seven encounters spread across a tenday. While the Shadow Thieves were physically removed from the city after that tenday, the spirits of the slain remained here. They did not manifest fully for more than two decades, but they have been infrequently active since that time as greater shadows. The spirits never manifest within 2 hours of highsun or if a light source is present. The touch of these greater shadows leaves slash marks on a victim's body, the first of which always occurs on the right ankle. If a victim is slain by one of these shadows, the right foot falls off as if severed, a well-known calling card of the Shadow Thieves.

This is a quiet place in which ruthless nobles dispose of "problems," and the PCs might just earn themselves an escort here if they displease the more amoral nobles in their activi-  
ties, whatever they might be. Over the decades, many political enemies of the local noble clans-especially the Jhansczils and Rosznars-have found themselves trapped in Lhestyn's Court after a disarming party at the nearby villa; such victims are often hemmed in the haunted locale until dead.

Greater Shadows (7): hp 58 each; Monster Manual page 221.

### Pharra's Alley (el io)

This alleyway is named for the first magistress of The House of Wonder (\$21), who died more than one hundred twenty years ago. It is a busy shortcut route used by merchants and their delivery carts, and is often crowded with would-be wizards coming to The House of Wonder hoping to hire on as an apprentice to a wizard. Some are anxious to impress everyone with their magic, or are just very, very nervous-and they have been known to let fly wildly with magic, endangering passersby.

They vanish hurriedly, though, when the Circle of Skulls appears. This spellhaunt (as wizards call it) is all that is left of some early priests of Mystra who tried to devise their own means of immortality and achieved only a lichlike state. These eerie skulls are always seen floating in a circle, arguing among themselves in hollow, echoing voices. They spit spells from their empty mouths or hurl beams of fire from their empty eye sockets when angered by those they encounter, but they are unpredictable and might help someone with information instead of attacking. They seem tied to Pharra's Alley, and they never appear anywhere else in the city (though the information they pass on indicates that they must be able to see and hear things in other parts of Waterdeep).

Flameskulls (9): hp 26 each; Lost Empires of Faerûn page 171.

### "The prowl" (EL 4)

This short alley loops eastward off Alnethar Street, and through a side-spur, links up with Cymbril's Walk to the south. It provides rear access to a row of shops and a row of apartments in the center of the block. Named for the acts of an eccentric nobleman who used to loose his pet panthers to stalk the alley, terrorizing the neighborhood (until one of the cats grew exasperated-or just hungry-one day and ate him), this otherwise unimportant alleyway is the favorite hunting-ground of a pair of skeletal hands that strangle folk from behind, leaving wither-scars where each finger presses deep into victims' throats. Some folk who have glanced into the alley at night but not entered have reported seeing two points of light, close together in the air, that resemble floating, glowing eyes.

This frightening killer doesn't strike often-four times a year, at most-and seems adept at evading detection whenever powerful wizards and priests come looking for it. No one is yet sure what it is-let alone how to destroy it. It seems to be active only in the hours of darkness, striking only in the alleyway, never at folk in buildings.

In truth, the killer is a dread, left behind with carefully crafted instructions by a long-departed evil wizard to torment his hated ex-neighbors.

### Dungeons of Waterdeep

Although many young Waterdhavians believe one must brave the wilds of the Savage Frontier or the depths of Undermountain when seeking monster-infested ruins, in truth plenty of dangerous locales can be found much closer to home. The City of Splendors contains quite a few dungeons, including the Citadel of the Bloody Hand, the Dungeon of the Crypt, the sewers that run beneath the entire city, the aquatic chasm known as Umberlee's Cache, and the granddaddy of them all, the playground of the Mad Mage Halaster, the vast Undermountain. In addition, a wide variety of smaller sites might challenge the intrepid explorer, including dark, haunted alleys, various crypts in the City of the Dead, the treasure vaults of Waterdeep's merchant elite, and the towers of city-dwelling wizards.

### Ahghairon's Tower

Born in the Year of Great Riches ( 920 DR), Ahghairon of Waterdeep arrived in Silverymoon in the Year of the Red Rain ( 927 DR ), yearning to learn magic. He was taken in and taught by numerous tutors. In the Year of Sudden Sorrows ( 941 DR), Ahghairon single-handedly destroyed a pair of young green dragons intent on attacking Silverymoon. Soon thereafter, Ahghairon left the city to learn more-about Toril, but little is known of his travels. He had returned to Waterdeep and built his tower by the Year of the Blazing Call ( 947 DR), for that is where Magister Taline Telgara, "The Flame of the North", found him after receiving visions from Mystra. By the Year of the Rings Royal ( 992 DR), Ahghairon was the official advisor to the War Lords of Waterdeep, and his history is thereafter wholly intertwined with that of the City of Splendors.

Ahghairon's Tower (C79) rises as a slim stone pinnacle with few windows and a conical roof four stories above the street. It is always quiet, never visibly changed by the passage of years nor disturbed by passersby. No one is thought to have entered it since Ahghairon's death, thanks to a series of wards erected through the cooperative effort of Ahghairon's apprentices (a mythal created with epic spellcasting), although in truth Lhoril Delhiirnyn stole the dragonstaff of Ahghairon before the wards were laid.

The tower is enclosed in a permanent forcecage (caster level 25), with a gap of 10 feet between the cage and the tower proper. If successfully disintegrated or otherwise destroyed, the forcecage reforms 10 minutes later. Within the forcecage, the tower is enclosed in an invisible prismatic sphere, within the prismatic sphere is a time stop field, within the time stop field is a spell turning field, and within that ward is variant of the alarm spell that sounds a loud, audible alarm in Piergeiron's Palace (C79), Blackstaff Tower (C6), and Herald's Holdfast (far to the north; see Silver Marches). If the alarm is triggered, a walking statue (see page 139) is teleported from Mount Waterdeep to the tower and set to attack the intruder. Some have speculated that it might be possible to bypass the wards with secret tokens of recognition or pass-phrases, but if such things exist, no one has admitted knowledge of them.

The contents of Ahghairon's Tower are largely unknown, although certain legendary items, such as Ahghairon's great cloak,  
are said to lie within. Iron and stone golems, as well as lurking spell traps, are also said to guard the wizard's treasures.

### Blue Alley

In the Year of the Blue Flame ( 1327 DR), a mad, reclusive mage named Keilier Twistbeard (CE male Chondathan wizard 20/planeshifter ${ }^{302} 4$ ) constructed the Blue Alley as a way to afford himself endless amusement. Although Keilier now wanders other planes, he still returns periodically to watch visitors encounter the alley's perils, making bets with old friends like Maaril on the victims' probability of success. The Blue Alley is a deathtrap, filled with cruel traps and illusions, and its only real treasure is the sword Magebane (see page 148).

Whenever PCs boast of their adventures in Waterdeep's shops and taverns, invariably the proprietor or one of the regulars will inquire, "Ah, have ye tried the Blue Alley yet, then?" Nearly all Waterdhavians have heard of the Blue Alley and know that it lies in Sea Ward. Residents of that ward usually know that its entrance opens on Ivory Street. Anyone who goes looking on Ivory Street can find the Blue Alley with a DC 10 Search check. The alley's blue paving stones glow faintly underfoot, leading to a T-shaped intersection adorned with a carved stone image of a man's face twisted' in fear.

### Catacombs of Rintros

The Tower of Yintros was once one of Waterdeep's preeminent schools of wizardry, standing beyond the walls at the northern end of the plateau where the Heroes' Garden ( $\$ 70$ ) stands today. Built by the archmage Yintros in the Year of Spreading Spring (1038 DR), it passed to his apprentice, Ulthorn, in the Year of the Lord's Dilemma (1066 DR). Ulthorn dwelt in the Tower of Yintros for over two centuries, educating generation after generation of Waterdhavian wizards.

In the Year of Thunder ( 1306 DR), Ulthorn died in a sorcerous duel with a vastly more powerful foe, the Archmage Ahrabose. In defeat, he slew his enemy by bringing the Tower of Yintros down upon them both with a great shout. Many of Ulthorn's young apprentices and prestidigitators of Waterdeep searched the wreckage of the tower that night, seeking items of power and written spells. The blasted corpse of Ulthorn was found with his shattered staff and emerald sigil ring, but many other treasures, including the Spellbook of Daimos, were never found. In the wake of the tower's destruction, the Lords of Waterdeep purchased the land on which it stood from Ulthorn's apprentice and heir, the wizard Rendergallis. The ruins of the tower were cleared and the land was transformed into a public park, known today as Heroes' Garden.

Unknown to all but a few, part of the Tower of Yintros still exists. The catacombs beneath the tower, used for spell research and magical experimentation, still exist, sealed from prying eyes by wards set in place by the Watchful Order. One entrance to the catacombs lies beneath the statue of Lhestyn, which can be pushed aside with a DC 24 Strength check if one first speaks the password, "Ulthorn." The other entrance lies in the sewers, through a secret door halfway down passage SF9. This secret door requires the same passphrase to bypass its wards. The

---

existence of the catacombs and the passphrase needed to bypass the wards are recorded in the Diaries of Rendergallis, of which several copies exist in various libraries around the city. A handful of adventurers have explored the Catacombs of Yintros over the years, but reports as to what they have found vary widely. From these contradictory accounts, sage Ilighast Chamnabbar (see page 72) has deduced that a powerful summoning ooze ${ }^{\text {MM } 3}$ must lie within, but that is just a guess.

### Citadel of the Bloody Hand

The shield dwarves of Clan Melairkyn built the subterranean citadel of Melairgate in the early days of their settlement in the eastern spur of Mount Waterdeep. The citadel served as the primary entrance into Melairbode and as a trading station for the Stout Folk to meet with the Fair Folk of Aelinthaldaar. After the elves abandoned their capital, the shield dwarves buried the doors to the citadel and turned it into a warren thick with traps, guardians, secret passages, and peepholes reachable only from below.

During the reign of Ulbaerag, the inhabitants of Bloodhand Hold rediscovered the dwarf citadel and claimed it for their own. They sealed the passage leading down to the depths of Undermountain, and transformed the subterranean fortress into a defensive redoubt to which they could withdraw if necessary. The citadel saw infrequent use over the years when the settlement was threatened, but it was otherwise ignored. Knowledge of its existence was lost in the Year of the Splendid Stag ( 754 DR) when Raulbaera Bloodhand led her followers inland and the village of Bloodhand Hold all but died.

In the Year of the Black Wind ( 1262 DR), a contingent of Waterdeep's small Thieves' Guild (now the Shadow Thieves) found the citadel while exploring a stairway leading up from the first level of Undermountain (now known as the Falling Stair because of the spectacular collapse it undergoes whenever anyone approaches before it reverts to its unblocked state). Word of this discovery was passed back to the guildmaster, known professionally as the Bloody Hand, who cheekily decided to make the citadel his stronghold, despite the fact that it lay directly under Castle Waterdeep.  
'After securing the citadel from the roving monsters set loose by Halaster, the guild renamed it the Citadel of the Bloody Hand, and constructed two links to the city sewers, a secret passage into the castle above (through which they could send spies to observe goings-on), and an escape route exiting on the western face of Mount Waterdeep, just above the ocean. The Shadow Thieves operated from this fortified base for over three decades before being driven from the citadel in the Year of the Pointed Bone ( 1298 DR) after Lhestyn Silmaeril infiltrated the guild and revealed the existence of the Citadel of the Bloody Hand to the Watch.

After the Shadow Thieves were driven from the city, the Lords of Waterdeep garrisoned the citadel and sealed the passage leading down the Falling Stair. The two passages to the sewers were left intact, garrisoned by the Guard and employed by high-ranking occupants of Castle Waterdeep when they needed a discreet exit. The seaward section of the Citadel was given over to the Harpers, who transformed it into the fortified refuge known as Harpers' Hold, and knowledge of its existence is now  
the exclusive province of Those Who Harp and a handful of the Lords of Waterdeep.

In the Year of the Gauntlet ( 1369 DR), during Halaster's Higharvestide, a horde of goblins, orcs, and ogres rushed up the Falling Stair and broke into the citadel. Although the Guard contingent prevailed, what seemed at first to be an easy victory has proven anything but such. In the wake of the goblinoid horde came a flood of living spells ${ }^{\text {MM3 }}$. These lingering remnants of Halaster's spells have somehow taken on sentience and refused to dissipate. As their numbers have continued to grow, the Guard has been forced to abandon the Citadel, sealing off the passage into Castle Waterdeep. Harpers' Hold is still accessible to Those Who Harp, but many leading Harpers are growing concerned that this refuge might soon have to be abandoned as well. Although the Guard refuses to allow adventurers into the Citadel of the Bloody Hand to investigate, several groups have done so by making the perilous trek through Undermountain and then up the Falling Stair. Those explorers who have returned and spoken of their experience have vanished soon thereafter, possibly abducted by agents of the Shadow Thieves seeking word of their lost redoubt.

### Cliffwatch Ruins

The Cliffwatch Inn was once a rambling old inn, recognizable for its exterior galleries. Although the place was shabby and well worn, its cheerful proprietor Felstan Spindriver (CG male Illuskan human commoner 4) more than made up for its flaws. Felstan was well known for helping folks in need of a place to hide, for directing adventurers or visitors to odd sites, and for chatting about rumors, treasure tales, and events around the city. The inn's cellars were rumored to contain secret passages down to smugglers' storage cellars, and from thence to the city sewers and Undermountain.

In the Year of the Shield ( 1367 DR), the inn was engulfed in multiple magical explosions that sent gouts of flame far into the air overhead. Since that night, the area has been surrounded by a high wooden fence and kept under constant observation by Guard and Watch patrols. The owner has not been seen since the destruction of his property, and he is believed dead. Offers to purchase the land have been repeatedly denied by the Lords, leading most to suspect that something dangerous still lurks within the ruins.

### Crypt of Chauntea

Long before the spires of the Open Lord's Palace graced the skies of Waterdeep, the site was home to an abbey of monks and clerics of Chauntea. The Abbey of Chauntea was one of the city's oldest buildings, built in the Year of Waving Wheat ( 554 DR) during the era of Bloodhand Hold. The abbey fell in fire and ruin during the Second Troll War and was never rebuilt.

Piergeiron's Palace (C75) is still haunted by the spirits of Chauntean monks who died in the conflagration, and no less than seven such hauntings have been observed. The most famous haunting is known as the Monks of the Three Candles, a ghostly procession that approaches the guardpost of the South Tower 2

---

hours before every dawn and marches up a long-vanished stair toward their old fields on the mountain's slopes.

Less well known is the Ghost of the Bathing Monk. He appears on the slopes above the palace on nights after a strong rain that fills a small hollow with a natural bathing pool. The spirit appears to notice some far-off danger and rushes down the mountain, dripping water as he goes, before vanishing into the ground just outside the palace walls. No one has ever dug into the ground where the spirit vanishes, but if someone did (and managed to avoid the notice of the Palace guards), she would discover a small stone staircase leading into the mountain and the long-forgotten undercroft of the abbey. From the undercroft, one can then reach the cellars used for storing seeds and the abbey's hidden treasury.

All knowledge of the catacombs was lost in the abbey's destruction, and the construction of Piergeiron's Palace atop the ruins obscured any chance that they would be discovered. The undercroft is haunted by a dozen or more huecuvas ${ }^{69}$, once monks of Chauntea who hid in the abbey's crypts rather than battle the trolls. The wrath of the Earthmother has also transformed the vast store of seeds within into a wide variety of undead plant monsters.

### Dungeon of the Crypt

Located beneath the northern end of the City of the Dead and the southern end of North Ward, the Dungeon of the Crypt was constructed at the behest of Artor Morlin (see page 59), a powerful and cunning vampire, during the Second Troll War. Legendary in the South as an enemy of all things Calishite, the mercenary lord moved north to Waterdeep after the construction of Castle Daggerford over the ruins of his old castle in the Year of the Advancing Wind ( 947 DR ) and found the burgeoning city to his liking.

The Dungeon of the Crypt can be reached from the city most easily by means of the Deepwinter Vault (CD10). As more than a few ne'er-do-wells have discovered, the wards on the crypt lapsed long ago; as the last of the Deepwinters died during the reign of the Guildmasters. In the center of the crypt, a huge coffin containing the crumbling corpse of some forgotten Deepwinter patriarch can be rotated sideways to reveal a steeply descending stair. After several landings (each furnished with a guardroom  
with firing-ports), this broad, steep staircase descends well over a hundred feet into a complex of rooms that looks like a defensible warehouse. A long tunnel leads off from this network of rooms to connect (by means of a secret door) with the first level of Undermountain. Privy-chutes and a partially collapsed descending tunnel also connect with caverns near Skullport. A narrow passage to a secret door connects with a secondary sewer passage (SF71). Tunnels that once ascended to some cellars in North Ward were filled in long ago, but they could be opened once again with some work.

The apparition that guards the Fireplace Level

At the northern end of the Dungeon of the Crypt, far from the areas reached by the Deepwinter Vault, is a chain of quite palatial rooms, the last of which is an ornate bedchamber connected to a large hall with a fireplace. This area was once the lair of Artor Morlin, before he was driven from his home by the Company of Crazed Venturers. Artor's escape route led up the chimney through the thick common wall of some North Ward businesses and exited among the chimneytops there. In the years since he was forced to abandon this lair, Artor has installed a succession of servitor vampires herein (never letting any live long enough to challenge him) to decoy any would-be vampire slayers from his own trail. The current occupant is Fhang (CE male doppelganger vampire rogue 9), a member of the Unseen who secretly serves Artor, unknown even to Hlaavin. Fhang is under instruction from Hlaavin to maintain a safe house for members of the Unseen, and under instruction from the vampire lord to keep up Artor's guise while in the Dungeon, on the off chance a member of the Company of Crazed Venturers might come seeking the long-vanished vampire of the Dungeon of the Crypt.

### The Fireplace Level

The Fireplace Level, so dubbed by the Company of Crazed Venturers, lies beneath the southern end of North Ward, just north of the City of the Dead. Built by an early member of the Gost family, the Fireplace Level once served as the source of that family's fortunes and a place to stash their ill-gotten gains. Although the complex is mentioned in private diaries still held by the Gost family, the current members of the clan have yet

---

to discover how to reach the complex, and they aren't even sure if it ever existed. (In his current guise as the aging seneschal of the Gost family's private militia, Artor Morlin keeps watch to ensure that the Gosts never find their old stronghold.)

Although the Company of Crazed Venturers first entered from the rear of the complex through the fireplace they found in the Dungeon of the Crypt, the primary entrance to the Fireplaće Leyel is through a secret staircase in the basement of the Gost Villa (N77) unknown to anyone other than Artor Morlin. The dungeon-side face of the door is warded with the gigantic, obviously spell-shaped floating face of Khelben, who bellows: "Turn back, whoever you are! Trespass in this area is prohibited!" (Khelben had nothing to do with this spell. It is simply a ruse left by a long-dead member of the Gost clan to deter interlopers from below from entering the family villa.) Other spell-wards also guard the place, some of them quite deadly to those who do not possess the Gost family crest.

A railless stone staircase leads down from the Gost villa basement to a room filled with inky, opaque water; additional steps lead down to its unseen depths. At the time the Company of Crazed Venturers explored this place, a trio of banelar inhabited the waters, but Artor has since replaced them with vampiric spawn created from merfolk he kidnapped from the harbor. The Company never discovered that the stairs leading down into the pool connected with the vampire's reserve crypt, or that Artor Morlin has continued to lair therein. Artor, of course, has another escape route-a portal connecting his lair with the dungeons of old Morlin Castle (which now lie beneath Castle Daggerford).

The Fireplace Level continues through a pair of rusting, iron double doors to a subterranean complex comprising a dozen or more storage chambers and beast cages. The Gosts were early backers of the Shadow Thieves, and over the years they accumulated a warehouse full of treasures plundered from Waterdhavian tombs and guilds. Many of those treasures were stashed in the Fireplace Level, and the Gosts left many traps and guardians to secure their ill-gotten gains. Long-dead ghosts of the Gundwynd family, who were imprisoned in the dungeon over a century ago, also haunt the Fireplace Level. A member of the Gost clan left the Gundwynds to starve in one of the beast cages so he could seize their possessions. Although a distant member of the Gundwynd clan eventually restored the family fortunes, the Gundwynds harbor lingering suspicion to this day that the Gosts had a hand in nearly destroying the Gundwynd family and fortunes.

A portal once led from the Fireplace Level to the Wormwrithings, a warren of twisting tunnels north and west of ruined Blingdenstone beneath the Lurkwood, and from there to a series of dangerous destinations across Faerún, allowing the Gost clan to import all manner of beasts from the Savage Frontier directly into Waterdeep. The Gost family was forced to abandon the complex in the Year of the Catacombs (1308 DR) when a purple worm came through the portal and triggered a temporal stasis trap. Years later, after the Company of Crazed Venturers discovered the place and turned the purple worm into solid silver, Laeral disposed of the worm's corpse, investigated the portal network, and then sealed the portal "for the safety of the city." Of course, enterprising adventurers could always attempt to unseal the portal.

The Fireplace Level has two other known exits. A staircase still leads up from the Fireplace Level to connect with the midden of the Grinning Lion (N76). Only its proprietor, Unger Farshal knows of the passage, and he has installed a secret door 20 feet down the stair that leads into sewer passage SF31. The other exit is a small fissure that opened up when the purple worm arrived and now connects with the sooty shaft leading out of Artor Morlin's old fireplace. Artor discovered the Fireplace Level after the fissure opened up and subsequently used his charms to ensure that the Gosts were fearful enough of the Gundwynd ghosts and the magically frozen purple worm to abandon the place and the treasures within. Unger uses both back exits during his regular runs to and from Skullport, passing down the stair, through part of the Fireplace Level, down into the Dungeon of the Crypt, and from there down to Skullport. To date, Unger has yet to explore much of the Fireplace Level, for the ghosts haunting the place have scared him off. Artor is aware of Unger's movements, but for now allows him to proceed unmolested.

### Maldiglas's Nefuge

Maldiglas Turntower "the Magnificent" reigned as Mystra's Magister from 1318 to 1322 DR. During his reign, Maldiglas created a number of magical refuges for arcane spellcasters to use in times of injury or sickness. One such refuge lies in a cavern deep inside Mount Waterdeep. The cave is approximately 40 feet in diameter and accessible only through two-way portals (two of which are located in each ward). From inside the cavern, one can see out the mouths of the fourteen portals that open into its walls and leave simply by stepping through those archways. An observer from the other sides of the portals cannot see in, and one can enter only by whispering the name of Maldiglas while stepping on the correct stone.

The existence of Maldiglas's Refuge is kept as secret as possible by the Watchful Order of Magists \& Protectors, concealed beneath a cloak of wild, exaggerated tavern tales told only when someone asks about the cave or claims to know something of it. Apprentices using scrying globes in Blackstaff Tower monitor use of the Waterdeep refuge. Khelben and Laeral have promised the Watchful Order and the Lords of the city that they will only intervene in visits to the refuge if one being attacks another within. They have made no promises, however, about not magically tracing or spying on users of the refuges, after such beings depart. The Watchful Order has secretly decided that anyone using the refuge more than twice in any month will be interviewed by senior mages of the Order as to their doings, aims, and current foes to uncover any possible perils to the Order, the city, or "the prosperity of ongoing trade in the North." The order is not above temporarily substituting false stones for the real ones to prevent specific portals from operating-particularly when Waterdeep is at war or there is suspicion of immediate covert magecraft hostile to the city.

The known, automatic powers of the refuge (really a mythal created with epic spellcasting) include the following spells cast upon anyone entering the refuge: break enchantment, endure elements, and heal. A single individual can receive the spells no

---

more than once per day, and the refuge can cast the spells five times per day. The portals leading to the refuge are as follows:

Castle Ward: 1st-Small, permanently chained-off (with chains anyone can step over or roll or crawl under) "mud sinkholes" between the Watching Tower (C68) and the Palace Stables (C17). 2nd-At the southwestern end of Fetlock Court (past the horse-trough).

City of the Dead: 1st-The stone that begins under the right heel of Ahghairon's Statue. 2nd-The "waterdrip wash" stones set under a downspout on the western side of the Mariners' Rest.

Dock Ward: 1st-The fish-shaped stone halfway down Odd Street, near its northern edge. 2nd-The moon-shaped stone set into the mouth of Aline's Way, were it meets Keel Alley.

North Ward: 1st-On the west side of the rain barrel that stands against the north wall of the Grinning Lion tavern (N56), just off Golden Serpent street. 2nd-Inside a cubicle behind an open doorway in the southeastern wall of Farwatch Tower. The cubicle is a tiny, tall bare room whose walls are several feet thick, and it is regularly checked by the Watch, beggars seeking shelter, conspirators, and lovers. The Watch has spread a story about the door being always open because they cannot keep it locked no matter how hard they try. Truthfully, the cubicle is a haunted sentry post.

Sea Ward: 1st-A footstone marking the burial site of a long-dead Open Lord's faithful guard dog, Rivuryn, which is set into the turf just south of a small stand of trees that lies inside the city wall immediately south of Seaseyes Tower (\$71). Sometimes a portable wooden bench hides the footstone. 2nd-A stone half-hidden under a downspout, on the seaward side of the Fanebar, at the southernmost corner where a narrow passage leads through Kulzar's Alley.

Southern Ward: 1st-The stones just outside the back (south) door of the Midnight Sun tavern (S9), where garbage is usually piled. 2nd-The round stone set into the street between Athal's Stables (S27) and the city wall guard tower that faces it.

Trades Ward: 1st-The huge, cracked, paving stone set into the eastern end of Ironpost Street, on its southern edge (right against the wall of the corner building). 2nd-On the rooftop of the Gray Serpent Inn (T43), just at the head of the back stairway on the outside wall of the building.

## Umberlee's Cache

Since the first trade-meets occurred on the shores of Waterdeep Harbor in -1088 DR, mariners have paid homage to Umberlee, the Bitch Queen, by dropping coins into the deepest reaches of the harbor in thanks for safe ports and safe passage in the coming year. Over time, this tithing attracted the attention of a small religious community of merfolk dedicated to appeasing Umberlee's wrath and safeguarding her offerings.

In the Year of Three Seas' Rage ( -334 DR ), merfolk clerics of Umberlee from Tharqualnaar  
![img-28.jpeg](assets/City%20of%20Splendors,%20Waterdeep_img-28.jpeg)

---

used magic to open the floor at the harbor's deepest point in the lee of Deepwater Isle, revealing deeper caverns beneath. Almost immediately, fierce currents pulled down all of the tithed coins that littered the harbor floor into the great, unplumbed depths below.

In the years that followed, those who used the harbor continued to make tithes to the Bitch Queen, although the exact ceremony varied slowly, over time. The modern form of this ceremony is known as the Fair Seas Festival, which comes at the end of Fleetswake (see page 15). Of course, the vast wealth known to lie in the depths of Waterdeep Harbor has proven to be an irresistible lure for treasure hunters. Merfolk wardens turn back most would-be explorers of Umberlee's Cache, but every once in a while a band of foolhardy adventurers makes it into the lightless depths.

All the caverns of Umberlee's Cache are considered to be under the effects of a permanent unballow spell placed here by the Bitch Queen herself. The upper caverns of Umberlee's Cache are haunted by sea wraiths, a self-propagating form of aquatic undead that continue to add to their number by transforming most interlopers into undead of a similar nature. Luckily, the light of the Deepwater Beacon (H7) keeps the sea wraiths from escaping into the harbor. The middle caverns of Umberlee's cache are guarded by a wide variety of fiendish aquatic monsters, including dire sharks, reekmurks ${ }^{53}$, squids, and giant octopi. In the lightless depths swim fiendish titans of the deep (krakens, leviathans ${ }^{1002}$, legendary sharks ${ }^{1003}$ ) and various aquatic demons (myrmyxicuses ${ }^{53}$, skulyvns ${ }^{53}$, and wastriliths ${ }^{53}$ ).

Violent, sudden currents that appear without warning and last for varying durations plague the lightless waters of Umberlee's Cache. All such currents tug at least slightly downward, inexorably drawing the treasures dropped into Umberlee's Cache toward a cavern called the Bitch Queen's Maw. For 24 hours each year, on the last day of Ches, a complete planar breach leading to Umberlee's domain in the Blood Sea of Fury's Heart opens in the center of the Maw, giving the cavern the planar traits of alterable morphic, strongly evil-aligned, and mild faith (as defined in the Dungeon Master's Guide and Player's Guide to Faerûn). A dozen or more tribute gatherers (advanced 24 HD half-fiendish giant octopi) emerge through the breach to gather up all the treasures that have reached the Maw and bring them into the Blood Sea. Although legends speak of a merfolk shaman who witnessed this event in centuries past, most sages believe such knowledge comes from dream visions sent by the Bitch Queen to her most faithful adherents.

### Vault of Stars

Waterdeep's first major temple to Selûne was located on the site that is today Moonstar Alley, which curls around the walled villa of the noble family for which it is named. Originally known as the High House of Stars, popular wisdom holds that it was burned to the ground in the Year of the Tomb ( 1182 DR ) by raiding worshipers of Bane who crept up from below and breached the temple's cellars. The interlopers slaughtered most of the residents before the alarm was raised, and by the time the Watch arrived, the temple was a towering inferno of flames that seemed impervious to magic. Selune's faithful are believed to have never set foot  
on the desecrated ground again, building their present temple a block to the west. Local rumor suggests that the cellars of the burnt temple still hold magic and wealth, buried under burned rubble, and that they can be reached by stairs and shafts now hidden under the paving stones of this alleyway.

In truth, Lord Vanrak Moonstar (see page 62) and his fellow Shaaran worshipers destroyed the High House of Stars before retreating into the Underdark. However, the undercroft of the High House of Stars, the building now known as the Vault of Stars, survived the conflagration and is still in the hands of the Moonmaiden's followers. Lady Alathene Moonstar. (see page 62), now an archlich, has continued her unending war with Vanrak and his followers and uses the undercroft only to pursue her research and investigations. Adventurers who learn of the Vault of Stars might be tempted to explore it, at least until they determine they've walked uninvited into the lair of a lich with a fantastic memory, a sharp wit, and a hunger for new stories of Waterdeep. If they cause any damage before realizing they've invaded the workplace of "one of the good people," they might find themselves paying their debts not in coin but in service to the Moonmaiden's cause.

### Wonderstar Garrison

Irritym Wonderstar was a powerful Waterdhavian wizard with close ties to the church of Gond and the Watchful Order of Magists \& Protectors. One of his many accomplishments was to graft the still-moving arm of a metal construct to the arm of Baelam "the Bold," an infamous thief of the Sword Coast who lost his left hand in a trap. In gratitude and admiration, Baelam gave up his thieving ways and explored his newfound interest in the Art.

In the Year of the Behir ( 1342 DR), Irritym was slain by thieves seeking to plunder his house of magic. Enraged, Baelam hunted down and slew his tutor's murderers and then spent the next several months learning what he could of his master's Art, trading lesser items and tomes to those who would teach him in exchange for training. The more powerful items and tomes he hid away somewhere beneath the city's streets.

In the decade that followed, Baelam roamed the cities of the Sword Coast, slaying thieves and taking their stolen wealth to further finance his training. In the process, he made many enemies, including the sorcerer Garthagul of Calimport and the infamous thief Sulban "The Silent" of Theymarsh. During this period, Baelam returned frequently to the City of Splendors, claiming Irritym's house as his own.

In the Year of the Crown ( 1351 DR), a group of thieves gathered secretly in Waterdeep to attack and slay Baelam and seize Irritym's remaining treasure. Baelam slew them all for their troubles and then quit Waterdeep to roam Faerûn, after giving the last of his master's magic to Khelben Arunsun.

Little more was heard of the late Irritym or Baelam in the years that followed until the Year of Wild Magic ( 1372 DR ). Beginning around Greengrass of that year, rumors spread through the City of Splendors that Garthagul of Calimport, while excavating the earthen floor of a Dock Ward warehouse, had discovered a heretofore unknown cache of Irritym Wonderstar's

---

constructs-a veritable army of steel warriors standing row upon row and bearing Irritym's distinctive exploding star-shaped sigil. On the heels of such rumors came whispers that there was no such cache, and that Garthagul himself had started such tales in a bid to draw Baelam back to Waterdeep. Within days of the rumor's widespread dissemination, Garthagul had vanished and sightings of Baelam were reported in nearly every tavern in the city.

Nothing more might have come of the incident if not for the discovery of a unique form of golem hidden in the cargo of a Calishite trading vessel bound for Garthagul's hometown shortly thereafter. The Lords quickly confiscated the golem, hiding it away in the depths of Castle Waterdeep "for further study," but the story spread quickly and served to validate the existence of the Wonderstar Garrison in the popular imagination. Whether or not such the Wonderstar Garrison exists still remains a mystery, but many continue to look for Wonderstar's "army of constructs."

### Sewers of Waterdeep

Waterdeep's sewers run beneath the entire city, with the notable exceptions of the harbor islands and the heart of Mount Waterdeep, forming a subterranean "dungeon" between the surface and the depths of Undermountain. The uppermost portions of the sewers are in present use and fairly good repair, thanks to the efforts of the Cellarers' and Plumbers' Guild. Many older, smaller tunnels are walled up and not in use-at least, not to carry sewage.

The map shows only the largest passageways of the sewers. These are of two sorts-primary and secondary, according to size. Primary passages are 20 feet across and contain 3 -footwide railless walkway ledges on both sides. Sewer workers cross passages by means of their 16 -foot "catch-poles" to vault across or by the use of boards, which they lay down as temporary bridges. The catch-poles are also used for reaching below water level to clear debris from sewer gratings. Secondary passages are 12 feet across with a single 3 -foot-wide ledge on one side (usually the more southerly or easterly). The countless feeder pipes (any sewer pipe less than 1 foot in diameter) and tertiary tubes (which can be crawled through by a Medium or smaller creature) are not shown.

Junction rooms are usually 30 -foot-by-30-foot stone cubicles, 20 feet high with a sitting ledge near the ceiling, above the muck. Surface shafts are 6 feet in diameter with iron rungs set in the walls to use as ladders to and from the sewers. The entrance to a surface shaft is a 3 -foot-wide hole capped by a removable metal (or metal-banded wood) cover.

The accompanying map is accurate, but some of its features (such as the junction rooms and surface-shafts) are distorted in size for clarity. The sewers themselves are unnamed, so those giving directions usually give them in relation to the point of entry.

### Sewer Properties

Waterdeep's sewers have masonry ceilings, walls, and floors. The floors are considered to be light rubble, thanks to all the debris  
that has been deposited over the years, adding 2 to the DC of Balance and Tumble checks.

Air: The air supply is reasonably good (from a survival standpoint) in the sewers, as the numerous small feeder pipes bring stench-ridden air down from the surface in addition to refuse.

Ambient Noise: The echoing water flow produces lots of noise, providing a -4 circumstance penalty on all Listen checks in the network.

Disease: The sewers are filled with tainted water. Any activity that results in a character's nostrils, mouth, eyes, or ears getting wet requires a DC 16 Fortitude save to avoid contracting blinding sickness. Anyone injured by a slashing or piercing attack (including natural bite, claw, gore, and sting attacks) must make a DC 12 Fortitude save or contract filth fever. (Both diseases are described on page 292 of the Dungeon Master's Guide.) Creatures who have survived in the sewers for an extended length of time are assumed to be immune to both afflictions.

Gratings: Sewer gratings are stout, but many are often old and rusty. They could be permanently set into stone walls or set to swing open on pivots when unlocked.

Iron Gratings: 2 in. thick; hardness 10 (8 if rusty); hp 60 (30 if rusty); break DC 25 ( 23 if rusty).

Illumination: Generally, there is no light in the sewers except beneath a sewer grate, where the filtered sunlight is equivalent to an immovable torch.

Scent: A terrible stench pervades the entire network, providing a -4 circumstance penalty on Survival checks for tracking when relying on scent.

Tracking: Walkway ledges are generally coated in a thin sheen of slime, making them "firm ground" for purposes of tracking.

![img-29.jpeg](assets/City%20of%20Splendors,%20Waterdeep_img-29.jpeg)

---

SF50: Junction Room (no surface connection)-located under the westernmost intersection of alleyways off Snail Street, north of Shesstra's Street.

SF51: Surface Shaft-entrance located in a cul-de-sac opening off of Belnimbra's Street, in the block bounded by Soothsayer's Way, Snail Street, and Rainrun Street.

SF52: Junction Room with Surface Shaft-entrance located in the westernmost dead-end of Quaff Alley (off the High Road).

SF53: Surface Shaft-entrance located just east of the Bell Tower (C46), on Soldiers' Street just southeast of Watchmen's Way.

SF54: Surface Shaft-entrance located at the intersection of alleyways just north of the Three Pearls Nightclub (D18).

SF55: Junction Room (no surface connection)-located under the wide part of Candle Lane, west off the Way of the Dragon.

SF56: Junction Room with Surface Shaft-entrance located in the westernmost end of a dead-end alley opening south off Simples Street.

SF57: Surface Shaft-entrance located at the intersection of Tsarnen Alley and Burdag Lane.

SF58: Surface Shaft-entrance located in the mouth of a dead end alley, where it joins Quill Alley between the Wide Way and Nethpranter's Street.

SF59: Surface Shaft-entrance located in the western end of a dead-end forked alley that opens east off Rivon Street, north of Spendthrift Alley.

SF60: Surface Shaft-entrance located in a cul-de-sac opening east off the north end of Drovers' Street.

SF61: Surface Shaft-entrance located halfway down Beacon Street.

SF62: Junction Room (no surface connection)-under Grocer's Lane where it meets Snake Alley.

SF63: Surface Shaft-entrance located in Rednose Alley, just east of Saddlers' \& Harness-Makers' Hall (S6)

SF64: Surface Shaft-entrance located in á cul-de-sac opening off the Rising Ride between Juth Alley and Caravan Court.

SF65: Surface Shaft-entrance located in the wide part of the alley that opens south off Olaim's Cut.

SF66: Surface Shaft-entrance located in the wide alley north of Coach Street, just west of the High Road.

SF67: Surface Shaft-entrance located in the alley just east of the former Prestar's Furniture (S54), east of Carter's Way and immediately south of Coachlamp Lane.

SF68: Surface Shaft-entrance located in the cellar of the Spouting Fish (S18).

SF69: Surface Shaft-entrance located in the wide area of the second alleyway north of Bellister's House (S25).

SF70: Surface Shaft-locked entrance located under Piergeiron's Palace (C75). This shaft opens into a cellar guarded at all times by five guard members and one armar (see City Watch, page 35 ); an alarm on the wall near them is sounded whenever they see or hear anything suspicious from the sewers below.

SF71: Secret Door-connects the secondary passage leading south from SF32 to the Dungeon of the Crypt.

SF72: Lair of the Xanathar-located directly beneath the Philosopher's Court, just east of the Snail Street and north of the Street of Curtains. It can be reached by way of two differ-  
ent secret doors into the sewers-one leading north from the secondary passage leading southeast from SF49, one leading west from the primary passage running roughly north-south between SF55 and SF56. It can also be reached by way of three different passages leading up into basements of the buildings above and a pair of tunnels that lead down into the Cavern of Eyes (UM L1). None of these connections is direct; each leads through a warren of trapped and warded passages just large enough for a beholder to make its way.

SF73: North Entrance to the Citadel of the Bloody Hand (see page 116)-connects the secondary passage west of SF53 with the once-secret northern entrance to the Citadel of the Bloody Hand. There is now a guard station here, once used to defend Castle Waterdeep from attack from below and now used to keep the living spell legacies of Halaster's Higharvestide trapped within.

SF74: South Entrance to the Citadel of the Bloody Hand (see page 116)-connects the secondary passages running north and west of SF48 with the once-secret southern entrance to the Citadel of the Bloody Hand. Otherwise identical to SF73.

SF75: Drain of Madness-a collapsed section of the sewer floor in the dark, flooded depths of SF21 leads down to a set of now-flooded chambers built long ago as a storage vault by some forgotten merchant. These chambers are now the home of the Savants of the Dark Tide.

### Sewer EnCounters

The sewers of Waterdeep are home to all manner of creepy crawlers, as well as bats, rats, and other various small animals. Many varieties of slimes, molds, and fungi are also found in the sewers, including brown mold, green slime, and yellow mold.

A wide variety of monsters are commonly encountered in the sewers as well. Many of these make their way through connections between the city's dungeons and the city's sewers. Many inhabitants of the city above also frequent the sewers, including members of the Cellarers' and Plumbers' Guild, merfolk from the harbor, solitary rogues, and various Agents of the Eye (see page 64). Several unique creatures known to roam the sewers include the following: a deathshrieker ${ }^{\mathrm{MM} 3}$ created in the aftermath of Myrkul's destruction; the Eye itself (see page 65), accompanied by a contingent of eyeball beholderkin ${ }^{\mathrm{MP}}$ and lurking stranglers ${ }^{\mathrm{MM} 3}$; XIülqil (LE doomsphere ${ }^{\mathrm{MP}}$ ), who seeks revenge on the Company of Crazed Venturers for its destruction decades before; a long-missing contingent of the Cellarers' and Plumbers' Guild who vanished during the Time of Troubles (CN male cursts ${ }^{\mathrm{MP}}$ [augmented humans] commoner 1); and the Savants of the Dark Tide (see page 57).

### Encounter Chance

As a party travels through Waterdeep's sewers, every 30 minutes it has a chance for a sewer encounter, as set out in Table 5-1: Sewer Encounter Chance. Groups moving at half their best possible speed or slower are treated as using cautious travel. Parties cloaking both sound and light use the hiding column. Passageways are considered to be primary, secondary, or tertiary, as noted above.

On the table, "Sewer Feature" refers to junction rooms, the immediate vicinity of sewer shafts, or other secret chambers (not shown) off a sewer passage. In addition, every time a party moves

---

through a sewer feature, there is a chance of an encounter. If the party remains in a sewer feature for 30 minutes or more, there is a chance of an encounter coming to them every 30 minutes per passage connecting to the sewer feature. For example, if a junction room connects to a primary passage and two secondary passages, roll three times per half hour the party remains in the vicinity of the sewer feature.

### Table 5-1: Sewer Encounter Chance

| Passage | Normal Travel | Cautious Travel | Hiding |
| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Primary | $20 \%$ | $10 \%$ | $5 \%$ |
| Secondary | $15 \%$ | $8 \%$ | $4 \%$ |
| Tertiary | $12 \%$ | $8 \%$ | $4 \%$ |
| Sewer Feature | $25 \%$ | $20 \%$ | $10 \%$ |

### Encounter Tables

Each encounter table includes the following information:  
d\%: The result on percentile dice that will generate this encounter. Use the Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, or Sewer Feature column, as appropriate.

Encounter: The type of creature encountered. Some of these might be groups, such as a merfolk patrol or contingent of the Cellarers' and Plumbers' Guild. If the indicated creature is a template, use the sample creature whose statistics appear in the template entry.

Number Encountered: The number of creatures encountered. If the term "See text" appears here, refer to the Encounter Descriptions section below for the exact composition of the encounter.

### Encounter Descriptions

Encounters needing further explanation are described here. Where appropriate, determine class, race, and alignment of each character by using the NPC generation tables in the Forgottén Realms Dungeon Master's Screen or in the Dungeon Master's Guide.

Aboleth: This encounter is with Nexil'Vendyliq (30\%), Avidna'Delinskyun (34\%), Inkyl'Deskiloop (34\%), or all three ( $2 \%$ ) and 1d6+6 skum per aboleth. If all three aboleths are slain, they do not reappear, and no encounter occurs. All three aboleths are described on page 57.

Beholder: There is a $20 \%$ chance this encounter is with the Eye (see page 65), accompanied by a contingent of 4 d 4 eyeball beholderkin ${ }^{\mathrm{MF}}$ and 4 d 4 lurking stranglers ${ }^{\text {MM3 }}$. Otherwise, it is an itinerant beholder.

Cellarer: The PCs encounter 1d6+6 human warriors (level 1d3) and 1 leader (warrior level 1d4+4). All cellarers are members of the Cellarers' and Plumbers' Guild and wear deep orange caps and cloaks, with a red border around all hems and cuffs. They wear leather armor and carry short swords and light crossbows.

Curst: During the Time of Troubles, a contingent of five Cellarers never returned from the sewers. Believed to be lost, they actually were transformed into cursts and continue to patrol the sewers. If the Eye is destroyed, this group does not reappear and no encounter occurs.

Deathshrieker: In the wake of Myrkul's destruction during the Time of Troubles, a deathshrieker was created in the sewers beneath what is now the Cynosure (C7). This undead horror

Doomsphere: There is a $95 \%$ chance that this encounter is with the doomsphere Xliilqil (unless he has been previously destroyed, at which time, the encounter is with a normal doomsphere). Before they disbanded, the Company of Crazed Venturers destroyed a beholder in Fell Pass at great personal cost. Now, decades later, the slayer of Savengriff (since resurrected) and Tzarrakyn the Elder has abruptly returned, stalking the sewers of Waterdeep as it tries to learn what happened to its killers.

Hand of the Eye: The PCs encounter Avaereene (see page 65) and 3d6 fighters of level 1d3+1 on a snatch-and-grāb kidnapping run. There is a $50 \%$ chance they will have 1 d 6 commoners of levels 1 d 3 in tow, destined for the slave markets of Skullport.

Merfolk: The PCs encounter 1d4+2 merfolk warriors of level 1d2 and 1 merfolk leader of level 1d4+1. If this encounter is indicated for any other ward than Dock Ward or South Ward, the players must reroll on Table 5-2.

### Undermountain

The great dungeon of Undermountain, also known as the Halls of the Mad Mage, is a vast subterranean complex carved into the roots of Mount Waterdeep and the great plateau on which the City of Splendors sits. Although Undermountain extends underneath the entire city and even beneath the sea floor to the west, the bulk of the dungeon lies beneath Mount Waterdeep (hence the name), as well as the western reaches of Castle Ward and Dock Ward.

Undermountain is said to include nine major levels and fourteen sublevels. Obviously no product of this scope could detail both the City of Splendors and Undermountain in the fashion they deserve, so this account is restricted to a brief description of the twenty-three dungeon levels and a catalog of some of the ways in and out. Dungeon Masters who lack access to the original Ruins of Undermountain, Ruins of Undermountain, 2, Skullport, The Lost Level, Maddgoth's Castle, and Stardock boxed sets and sourcebooks are encouraged to make up their own dungeon, throwing everything they can possibly think of and more against the PCs. For centuries, Halaster stocked his dungeon with monsters and traps of all description, so nothing should be considered out of bounds.

The abbreviation for each level or sublevel is simply UM (for Undermountain), L or SL (for level or sublevel), and a number or letter (levels are given numbers, sublevels are given letters). For example, UM SLB means Undermountain sublevel B.

### Wous in and out

The halls of Undermountain are linked to the surface world in countless ways, both physical and magical. Halaster uses his network of portals to bring in monsters from all across Faerún to restock his dungeon. He also uses portals to draw adventurers into the deeper regions, rarely explored, and to give the occasional lucky adventurer an unexpected escape. Some of the notable physical links are described below.

Blue Mermaid Passage: This connects a dry well in the cellar of the Blue Mermaid tavern (D27) to the Port of Shadow.

Castle Corkscrew: This passage corkscrews down from the cellars of Castle Waterdeep to Skullport, bypassing the first two levels.

Falling Stair: This connects the dungeons of Castle Waterdeep (C76) and the Citadel of the Bloody Hand (UM SLA) with Undermountain's first level (UM L1).

Long Dark Stair: This links the oubliette of the Blushing Nymph festhall (C81) with Undermountain's first level (UM L1)

South Seacaves: This links the Sea of Swords on the western flank of Mount Waterdeep with the River Sargauth by means of a set of hoists.

Yawning Portal: Built atop the ruins of Halaster's Hold, the Yawning Portal inn (C48) contains the primary entrance into Undermountain, a large well that drops down into Undermountain's first dungeon level (UM L1). Secondary entrances are found in the inn as well, including a link to the inn's less well known "wet" well and a passage leading out of the Yawning Portal's cellar.

### The Upper Levels

The Upper Levels of Undermountain show the influence of a variety of builders over the centuries. The dwarves of Melairbode constructed the Citadel of the Bloody Hand (UM SLA) and the series of stairs, shafts, and passages that connected it through what is now the Upper and Deep Levels to the Lower Levels. The Stout Folk also began mining operations on this level before being driven out. Halaster and his apprentices

---

excavated what the dwarves had begun with their spells and enslaved beasts. Netherese wizards constructed the southern half of the Sargauth Level from a series of rough caverns and waterlogged tunnels.

### UM SLA

### The Citadel of the Bloody Hand

Dug into the heart of Mount Waterdeep, the Citadel of the Bloody Hand has until recently been occupied by the Guard. Since Halaster's Higharvestide, the Citadel of the Bloody Hand has become the preserve for the living spells ${ }^{\mathrm{MM}}$ that escaped the Mad Mage.

### UM L1: The Dungeon Level

The Dungeon Level has long been used by the Lords of Waterdeep as a dumping ground for undesirables, hence its most common name. It is also known as the Temple Level, for the many temples of dark gods that have been constructed here over the years, and the Tomb Level, for the many lords and kings that have been interred herein as well. As explorers of Undermountain often visit this level, its features are common tavern-talk of Waterdeep. Notable features of the Dungeon Level include the Bone Throne, the Cavern of Eyes, the Falling Stair, the Grim Statue, the Hall of Sleeping Kings, the Hall of Three Lords, the House of Pain, the Lanceboard Room, the Sundered Throne, the Temple of Gulkulath, and the Temple of the All-Seeing One.

### UM L2: The Storeroom Level

On this level, Halaster and his apprentices excavated the rough stone caverns and mining tunnels left by the dwarves to house their acquisitions and magical experiments. Notable features of the Storeroom Level include the Doomgate, the Helmwatch, and Lord Hund Hillgauntlet's Tomb.

### UM L3: The

Sargauth Level  
Known for the River Sargauth, which winds through this massive level, Undermountain's third level consists of two major sections. The southern third of the level consists of the remnants of the Sargauth Enclave, now split by a massive cave-in leading to the Port of Shadow and the Promenade of the Dark Maiden. The northern two-thirds of this  
![img-30.jpeg](assets/City%20of%20Splendors,%20Waterdeep_img-30.jpeg)  
level was constructed by Halaster and his apprentices, and served much the same role as Undermountain's second level. The most notable features of this level are the Lair of the Eye and the rubble-filled Pit of Ghaunadaur, a mile-deep shaft that leads from the Prime Material Plane into the Cauldron of Slime through an intermittently existent planar breach.

### The Deep Levels

Halaster's ex-apprentices have historically dominated (but in no sense controlled) Undermountain's middle levels. Halaster's Higharvestide prompted at least three of these apprentices to quit this region, and the ensuing power struggle has devolved into nigh-constant strife among the many inhabitants of the oft-called Apprentice Levels.

### UM L4

### The Farms Level

The fourth level of Undermountain contains farms no surface dweller would recognize. Halaster's mightiest magic brought the River of the Depths, also known as the River Sargauth, to this level, where it links huge caverns in broad, sweeping curves, and is navigable by barges. In these caverns, slaves and servants of the drow, aboleth, and other races of the Realms Below produce slimes and algae for food. Halaster controls his own farms here, too, and their produce is teleported to "feed-bin" rooms throughout the dungeon (rooms known to resident monsters as "watering-holes").

Undermountain's privies are also rinsed by magically pumped or redirected water into miniature portals that bring their contents to the farms. The dung-heaps produced by this process are inhabited by advanced otyughs and gulguthydras ${ }^{\mathrm{MP}}$, among other foul scavengers.  
All of these farms are quite valuable, as there are few large sources of good

---

food underground; thus, all are heavily guarded. The drow and Halaster have both used fearsome monsters as guardians, including death tyrants, advanced nagas with many sorcerer levels, dragon turtle sorcerers, and even wilder creatures.

A large, eerily dark lake at one end of the level supports a kuo-toa "fish factory" of the blind white fish of the depths, an important industry, heavily guarded to prevent food-raids from other creatures of the Underdark with the aid of an advanced 30 HD kuo-toa leviathan ${ }^{156}$. An island in the middle of the lake is home to an advanced 18 HD oryugh, piled deep in dung, offal, carrion, and other refuse that finds its way down long, twisting garbage-shafts from Skullport.

### UM SLB: The Shaft

The 37,000-foot-long Shaft, also known as Belkram's Fall for the unfortunate dwarf who discovered it, was originally a lava tube, but it became a rough, empty cavity long ago. Clan Melairkyn smoothed the shaft's sides, reinforced the stone in certain areas with mithral bracing, and installed winches and pulleys at various points up and down the shaft, all to move mithral from the lower mines to areas closer to the surface. Unfortunately, the Shaft also proved their undoing. Drow invaders levitated up the shaft from the depths to attack the heart of Melairbode, precipitating the gradual fall of the dwarf hold.

Hundreds of side tunnels lead out from the Shaft, most connecting with chambers and tunnels that were once either living chambers or mines. Considered a "vertical sublevel," the Shaft connects all the major levels between the Farms Level (UM L4) and the Terminus Level (UM L8), as well as many sublevels in between.

### UM L5: The Maze Level

This level contains five major features of note-the drow outpost of Kyorlamshin, the Lair of the Umber Hulks, the Maze of Madness, an old dwarf hold built by Clan Melairkyn and expanded by the duergar, and the winding channels of the River Graymurk. Kyorlamshin is linked by a series of portals to the city of Karsoluthiyl, which lies deep beneath the ocean floor west of Baldui's Gate. The drow of House Tanor'Thal continues to dominate both settlements and the slave trade that links them. The Maze of Madness is the creation of Halaster, stocked with ravenous minotaurs and magic traps to confuse and trip up the unwary.

### UM L6: The Seadeeps

This level once housed two major mining operations of Clan Melairkyn. Nigh-endless mining tunnels stretch westward, following two now-vanished veins of mithral beneath the ocean floor. Only numerous dwarf-built locks and pumps prevent the ocean waters from seeping down and wholly flooding this level.

The Seadeeps have numerous connections to the Swordsea Depths, as the Underdark beneath the Sea of Swords is known. At the present time, the Swordsea Depths are host to a long-running three-sided battle between an alliance of svirfneblin and tomb tappers ${ }^{342}$, drow troops from Karsoluthiyl, and certain aboleth and their evil servant creatures. The Savants of the Dark Tide (see page 57) are refugees from this conflict.

### The Dark Levels

The Dark Levels are a confused area of sublevels that lie between levels 4 and 6 of the main dungeon. Many are accessible only through portals and are otherwise difficult to reach.

### UM SLC: The WyLlowwood

An apprentice of Halaster created the Wyllowwood over a century ago for his beloved, an elf druid named Wyllow. Set in a cavernous region carved by a tributary of the River Sargauth, this level is dominated by the Wyllowwood, a thriving forest nourished by sunlight filtered through a massive portal in the "sky" above. Other notable features include a temple of the Destroyer and a long-abandoned lakeside village built by the Stout Folk of Clan Melairkyn.

### UM SLD: The Lost Level

Entombed in solid rock, the Lost Level is almost inaccessible, and its primary egress is said to be a portal guarded by the "Ring of Death," a waiting ring of death kiss ${ }^{M F}$ beholderkin, death tyrant beholderkin, and the beholder lord Nagus (LE advanced 20 HD beholder sorcerer 8). The Lost Level is divided into three sec-tions-a temple of Dumathoin and crypt for Clan Melairkyn's rulers, a drow prison now dominated by Huntmistress Dhusarra (CE female Calishite human vampire fighter 2/clerie 14 [Malar]), and a massive cavern carved by a branch of the River Sargauth and now split by an earthquake-caused tremor.

### UM SLE: Trobriand's Graveyard

The Stout Folk originally mined this sublevel for mithral, leaving it, by chance or for mysterious reasons, in the crude image of a scorpion. Before Halaster's Higharvestide, the Realm of the Metal Masters was home to Trobriand's rejected constructs, built before he perfected his scaladars. By Halaster's Higharvestide, Trobriand's cast-offs had organized themselves into a self-governing community for mutual defense, and they took advantage of the chaos to escape through a portal to their master's secret sanctum (UM L7) and claim it for themselves. In the wake of their departure, this level was largely abandoned, but it didn't remain that way for long. After being driven from Undermountain by the Eye, Misker the Pirate Tyrant (see page 65) fled to this level and made it his own. Now a portal links the beholder's lair to the Ilzimmer Villa (\$40), and House Ilzimmer has begun storing its ill-gotten gains herein.

### UM SLF: The Slitherswamp

Located deep beneath the city of Waterdeep, the Slitherswamp is a largely unexplored sublevel between UM L4 and UM L5. Further details of this level are revealed in Serpent Kingdoms.

### UM SLG: Muiral's Gauntlet

Muiral's Gauntlet is a sublevel built by the drow soon after their initial invasion that included living quarters and a warrior academy. Muiral transformed these chambers into a trapfilled gauntlet haunted by giant spiders, undead, and driders. Although the monstrous mage has abandoned this area, his deadly creations remain.

---

### UM SLH: Troglodyte WarRens

This region of caves is accessible only by a two-way random portal. It is home to two warring tribes of troglodytes-the Urggroth-Kyan clan and the Szygmog-Thurgin clan.

### UM SLI: The Obstacle Course

The Obstacle Course is a sublevel composed of a long chain of trap-filled rooms. Carved from the earth by the will of Tyr, this sublevel is intended as a potentially lethal test for conceited, cocky braggarts who do not respect the dangers of adventuring.

### UM SLJ: MaddGOTH's LeVEl

Maddgoth's Level is a small sublevel famed for the presence of Maddgoth's castle. Built by Halaster, this miniature, floating castle is enveloped in a reduction field that reduces all creatures within it to one-twelfth their normal size.

### UM SLK: The Crystal Labyrinth

The drow constructed this chamber as a training ground for their young in the Year of the Blue Ice ( 148 DR ). Halaster discovered it in the Year of Secret Slaughters ( 326 DR ) and made it his own, with transparent crystal walls, floors and ceilings, and a coral-floored cavern filled with seawater directly below. At the heart of the labyrinth lies Halaster's Aqitocrun, a treasure chamber in which he stores prized possessions.

### UM SLL: ARCTURIADOOM

This level was long the private demesne of Arcturia, one of Halaster's most ambitious apprentices. After her death during Halaster's Higharvestide, contingency magics whisked her corpse to her sanctuary, leaving the illusion of a body in their wake. Thanks to careful preparations, Arcturia was reborn as a vile form of undead (CE. half-fey female Chondathan human worm that walks ${ }^{52}$ - wizard 15). She now works to restock the monsters guarding this level, now known to a handful of daring explorers as Arcturiadoom.

### UM SLM: VANRAKDOOM

This sublevel was claimed by Lord Vanrak Moonstar (see page 62) for the followers of the Night Maiden in the Year of the Howling Moon ( 1130 DR ). A sprawling shadow-cloaked temple of Shar and an army of creatures from the Plane of Shadow that defend the abbey dominate Vanrakdoom.

### The Gauntlet below

The Gauntlet Below consists of the lowest three levels of Undermountain. It is so named for the gauntlet of dangers it poses to creatures from the Realms Below attempting to make their way up into Undermountain's heart. Halaster's constructs and immigrants from the Underdark who want to prevent others from following them upward man the various fortifications built by the Stout Folk of Clan Melairkyn.

### UM L7: The Caverns of OOZe

Largely avoided by the Stout Folk of Clan Melairkyn in their day, the Caverns of Ooze have long been home to all manner  
of slimy creatures serving That Which Lurks. Countless slimes, oozes, jellies, and other amorphous creatures frequent these natural caverns. For centuries, a colony of ghaunadans ${ }^{\mathrm{MP}}$ has attempted to transform this level into a massive temple of Ghaunadaur, but Halaster has continued to frustrate such efforts. Many suspect that the inhabitants of this region emanate from the bottom side of the planar breach that lies at the bottom of the Pit of Ghaunadaur (UM L3) and make their way down through a warren of narrow tubes, but such a connection has never been proven.

Trobriand the Metal Mage (see page 28) once had his private sanctum on this level, but it was overrun by constructs from UM SLE during Halaster's Higharvestide.

### UM L8: The Terminus Level

The Terminus Level is a mix of dwarf-built chambers, now-depleted mithral mines, and vast natural caverns. Many of the one-way portals used by Halaster to restock Undermountain with dangerous monsters open into the sprawling caverns of Undermountain's eighth layer. Additionally, the Mad Mage's failed or freed experiments also wander this level. The Terminus Level connects with the heart of Undermountain through the Shaft (UM SLB).

### UM L9: The Mad Wizard's Lair

Built by Clan Meláirkyn as a trading outpost, Undermountain's ninth level is linked to the Underdark by a large number of sinkholes, each ringed by fortifications allowing a small number of defenders to hold off almost any invader. This level was one of the first to fall to the drow, who then quickly made their way up the Shaft (UM SLB) into the heart of Undermountain.

Said to hold the fabled treasure of Halaster the Mad, this level is whispered of in Waterdhavian taverns late at night by those who dare to dream of plumbing the depths of Undermountain. Of course, Halaster himself has spread many of these rumors, in hopes of inducing more adventurers to die foolish deaths in his trap-filled Underhalls. In reality, Undermountain's ultimate level is one big gauntlet of nasty traps and horrifying monsters.

The waiting treasure is also the subject of much speculation. Some whisper that vaults full of hundreds of mighty magic items and countless gems lie hidden in the depths of Halaster's Lair, while others claim that Halaster's greatest and cruelest joke is that the legendary hoard is no more than a pittance.

### Ilvastarr Vault

Like most Waterdhavian noble families, the Ilvastarr clan has at least one secret vault hidden within the City of Splendors. Such vaults serve to hold family heirlooms, records, and hard currency savings. They also prove useful for hiding embarrassing secrets and covering up the misdeeds of the past. The Ilvastarr Vault is typical of such repositories. As such, it can be easily adapted to serve as the vault of any other noble family. The exact location of the Ilvastarr Vault is left up to the DM to determine, although the most likely location is somewhere beneath the Ilvastarr Villa ( $\mathrm{N}^{2} 3$ ) or an otherwise anonymous warehouse in Dock Ward.

This adventure site is suitable for characters of 3rd to 5 th level.

---

### Character Hooks

The PCs might become interested in this hidden vault through one of the hooks below.

The Belabrantan family has long suspected the Ilvastarr heirs of concealing the Griffontack of Belabranta, a set of heirloom magic items lost over three centuries ago during the Battle of Blood-Drenched Swords. Lord Moedt Belabranta, heir of House Belabranta, hires the characters to break into the Ilvastarr Vault and settle the matter once and for all.

Lord Gotom Ilvastarr, heir to House Ilvastarr, approaches the characters discreetly through a trusted intermediary. He is concerned that his elder brother, Lord Ulguth II (LE male Tethyrian human aristocrat 11), has been seen making repeated, clandestine visits to the Ilvastarr vault for no apparent reason. Lord Gotom hires the PCs to follow his brother into the vault and discover what he is doing without confronting him directly.

### Vault Layout

The Ilvastarr Vault has been designed to deter would-be thieves, while still allowing straightforward access to a member of House Ilvastarr familiar with the defenses.

Stonework: All areas have 10 -foot-high, barrel-vaulted, bare stone ceilings unless specified otherwise. The walls are made of mortared blocks of stone quarried from the Sword Mountains.

Strong Wooden Doors (locked): 2 in. thick; hardness $f$; hp 20 hp ; break DC 23; Open Lock DC 25.

### V1: Chamber of the Crouching WYRM (EL 11)

This room contains a stone golem, a creature normally far too strong for low-level characters to face. Here, it is intended to serve as an obstacle in this encounter, not an opponent. Characters need only retreat out of the creature's reach, and it will not strike them. Figuring out how to get the golem to move isn't easy, but it should be a better solution than fighting. such a strong monster.  
The stairs lead down and south to one end of an arched barrel vault, 30 feet long, Two smaller side-vaults form ballways alongside the main vault. In the center of the room on a low, octagonal pedestal crouches a statue in the shape of a stone man with draconic features, ready to pounce.  
Unlike the rest of the Ilvastarr vault, the floor of this room is relatively dust-free, suggesting that most visitors do not go past this room.

Trap: The dais beneath the golem is warded by an alarm spell. It is set to trigger a mental alarm if anyone steps into area V1 without saying the word "Wyrmbáit." If, and only if, Lord Gotom Ilvastarr (the Ilvastarr heir) is within one mile of the vault ( $67 \%$ chance), the alarm alerts him to the presence of intruders in the family vault. Lord Gotom's planned response is to dispatch the house guard (treat as a double contingent of a standard Watch patrol, as detailed on page 36). Depending on where you place the vault, it can take anywhere from a few rounds to an hour or more before the Ilvastarr guards arrive.  
![img-31.jpeg](assets/City%20of%20Splendors,%20Waterdeep_img-31.jpeg)

---

Alarm: CR 1; magic device; proximity trigger (alarm); automatic reset; Atk n/a; Search DC 26; Disable Device DC 26.

Creature: Despite its unusual appearance, the statue is simply a stone golem. It ignores the presence of intruders unless they attack it or try to move it. If so provoked, it attacks anyone in the room, but does not leave the chamber. If anyone in the room prominently displays the I/vastarr pendant, the stone golem immediately ceases its attack and moves to the west side of the room.

Stone Golem (1): hp 107; Monster Manual page 137.  
Secret Exit: A secret stairway beneath the golem's pedestal leads down to area V4 (Search DC 20). If the stone golem is destroyed or induced to move aside, the low round stone pedestal can be rotated aside, swinging away on a pivot rod in the west side of the pedestal. The pedestal easily turns clockwise, but doing so triggers the trap (a glyph of warding, described below). If the pedestal is turned counterclockwise, the trap remains untriggered.

Glyph of Warding (Blast): CR 4; spell; spell trigger; no reset; spell effect (glyph of warding [blast], 5th-level cleric, 2 d 8 acid, Reflex DC 14 half); multiple targets (all targets within 5 ft.); Search DC 28; Disable Device 28.

Ad-Hoc Experience Award: It is assumed that a stone golem is too difficult for the PCs to defeat, given the intended Challenge Rating of the rest of the encounters. If the characters manage to circumvent the golem and enter area V4, award them experience points as if they defeated a CR 5 creature.

### V2: Hunting Ways (EL 5)

The east-west passageway and the north-south archways compose the hunting grounds of the creatures in V3.

Three dustand cobweb-filled doorways lead off into the gloom from the chamber of the statue, opening into a short east-west corridor. Two more doorways lead south beyond this passageway.

No creatures guard area V2, but the watchspiders of V3 are trained to attack and kill intruders in this area.

Creatures: See area V3.  
Tactics: The watchspiders in area V3 are alerted to the presence of intruders by making successful Listen or Spot checks. When in this area, the watchspiders exhibit a pack mentality and degree of coordination unknown to their mindless kin. They are well aware of the location of the pit traps and do their best to herd foes into the pits, if at all possible.

Traps: Three pit traps line the halls of V2. Pits A and B are wide-mouthed spiked pit traps. They are triggered when a character walks over the center square, though characters in the squares adjacent to the center square are also threatened when the trap is sprung. Pit C is a simple deep pit trap, with no spikes.

Wide-Mouth Spiked Pit Trap ( $A$ and $B$ ): CR 4; mechanical; location trigger; manual reset; Reflex DC 20 avoids; 20 ft . deep (2d6, fall); multiple targets (first target in each of two adjacent 5 -ft squares); pit spikes (Atk +10 melee, 1d4 spikes per target for $1 \mathrm{~d} 4+2$ each); Search DC 18; Disable Device 25.

Deep Pit (C): CR1; mechanical; location trigger; manual reset; hidden switch bypass (Search DC 25);

Reflex DC 15 avoids; 20 ft . deep (2d6, fall); single target; Search DC 20; Disable Device DC 23.

Development: The fact that one of the three pit traps is less dangerous than the others is an indirect clue that someone might enter it deliberately. There is a secret door in the east wall at the bottom of the pit (Search DC 20) leading to area V7.

### Pits A and B: <br> Guardgoyle Pits (EL 5)

These two pits contain more than just deadly spikes. At the bottom of each pit are two small niches, hidden from direct view above.

The bottom of the spike-filled pit is littered with bones and other debris. To the left and right are small niches filled with leering gargoyle statues. Suddenly, one slashes at you with its claws, while the other yanks on a rope above you, making a clattering racket.

A rope leads from a hook on the back of one niche to a sideways wooden sliding door above the east niche.

Creature: Each niche houses a guardgoyle.  
Guardgoyle (2): hp 21 each; see page 135.  
Tactics: Neither guardgoyle leaves its niche unless forced, as doing so would expose it to attacks from above. While one guardgoyle attacks, the other guardgoyle pulls on the rope. This has the effect of pulling the sliding door across the pit, cutting it in two. Anyone attempting to rescue a comrade trapped down below must first descend to the wooden door and push the door partway back (a full-round action) before joining the combat. The pit spikes (see area V2) make one attack per round against any creature standing in the bottom of the pit (but not the niches) unless the creature succeeds on a DC 10 Balance check.

---

### V3: Spiders' DEN (EL 4)

This room is the lair of the four trained watchspiders that guard the upper level of the Ilvastarr Vault.

The passage opens into a long room, some ten feet wide and twenty-five feet long with a barrel vault ceiling running east-west. The room is filled with cobwebs, and bones of humanoid-sized creatures litter the floor.

The spiders are found herein only if they have not already been alerted to the presence of intruders in area V2.

Creature (EL 4): Four watchspiders make this chamber their lair. The spiders have been trained to obey anyone speaking Draconic.

Watchspiders (4): hp 11 each; see page 140.  
Treasure: The largest watchspider has a small amulet tied to its rear left leg, nearly obscured by the spider's thick pelt. It readily surrenders the Ilvastarr pendant if so ordered in Draconic. Scattered about the room are a handful of coins collectively worth 200 gp . A DC 10 Search check is required to find more than a quarter of the coins.

### V4: CHAMBER OF FRESCOES

But for the frescoes described below, this chamber is empty.  
The trapdoor leads down to a five-foot-square alcove, which opens onto a barrel-vaulted chamber some twenty feet long and fifteen feet wide. At the far end of the room, passageways lead east and west. The walls of this chamber are lined with frescoes depicting daring individuals (most likely members of House Ilvastarr) capturing fearsome beasts, including chimera, dragons, manticores, and gigantic snakes.

### V5: West VaUlt

Although the vault was once used for storage, it is now home to a shameful family legacy.  
The door opens into a barrel-vaulted chamber some fifteen feet square. In the center of the room lies a low, black marble bier. Atop the bier rests a suit of full plate armor in repose. On the far wall is a large steel shield emblazoned with a metallic green dragon rampant with a bright orange eye. The dragon appears to balance a set of scales on its long, forked tongue.

The late Lord Haran Ilvastarr, granduncle of the current lord, was a noted paladin of Helm and ward civilar (captain) of the city watch in his day. During the Guild Wars, he deliberately withdrew several Watch patrols from one neighborhood, allowing an allied merchant family to attack a rival family and burn their villa to the ground. His perfidy came to light during the reign of the Lords-Magister, and as his crimes were directed at an ally of House Zoar, he was summarily tried and hung. Members of House Ilvastarr took possession of the body and hid it away in this crypt, fearful of what might arise from his remains. A cleric of Tymora cast a ballow spell herein, preventing Lord Haran from rising as an undead creature.

Treasure: Lord Haran's bones lie within the +1 full plate armor. The shield, known as the Ilvastarr bulwark, is a +1 heavy  
steel shield. It is recognizable with a DC 20 Knowledge (history) check or a DC 15 Knowledge (local Waterdeep) check as the device of the infamous Lord Haran Ilvastarr. The bearer of the shield gains a -4 circumstance penalty on Charisma-based checks made against anyone of nonevil alignment who recognizes the device.

Development: Should any part of Lord Haran's mortal remains be removed from this chamber for any reason, his spirit will no longer be constrained from rising as an undead monster. Within 24 hours, his remains transform him into a LE male huecuva ${ }^{10}$ ex-paladin 9. The monster then rampages through the city, attacking anyone it sees. If word of the PCs' involvement in the huecuva's rampage should get out, members of House Ilvastarr hire rumormongers to spread their infamy far and wide (and thus deflect shame from their own house).

### V6: EAST VAULT (EL 5)

The Ilvastarr family uses the east vault to hold important business records, as well as part of the family savings. It also contains the evidence of a past theft they've never acknowledged or attempted to make right.

The door opens into a barrel-vaulted chamber some fifteen feet square and twenty feet tall. As the door opens, a gravelly voice from somewhere above the doorframe calls out, "Uninvited guests, I presume? Please do not force me to destroy you."

Unfortunately for the characters, this room also contains a deadly guardian, as referenced by the mysterious voice.

Creature: In a 5 -foot-deep niche above the doorway, lurks a spectator tasked with guarding the contents of the western vault.

Qilnax, Beholderkin, Spectator ${ }^{\mathrm{MP}}$ : CR 4; Medium aberration (extraplanar); HD 4d8+8; hp 26; Init +5 ; Spd 5 ft., fly 40 ft . (good); AC 16, touch 11, flat-footed 15; Base Atk +3 ; Grp +3 ; Atk +4 ranged (touch; eye rays) and +3 melee ( 1 d 4 , bite); Full Atk +4 ranged (touch; eye rays) and +3 melee ( 1 d 4 , bite); SA eye rays, spell-like abilities; SQ all-around vision, darkvision 60 ft., flight, planar fast healing, spell turning, spell resistance 12; AL LN; SV Fort +3 , Ref +2 Will +5 ; Str 10, Dex 12, Con 14, Int 14, Wis 12, Cha 15 .

Skills and Feats: Knowledge (the planes) +9 , Listen +3 , Search +13 , Sense Motive +8 , Spot +14 , Survival +1 ( +3 following tracks); Alertness ${ }^{8}$, Flyby Attack, Improved Initiative.

Eye Rays (Su): Each of a spectator's four small eyes can produce a magic ray once per round, as a free action. During a single round, it can aim only one eye ray at targets in any one 90 -degree arc (up, forward, backward, left, right, or down). The remaining eyes must aim at targets in other arcs, or not at all. Each ray has a range of 60 feet and a save DC of 14 (caster level 6th). The save DCs are Charisma-based. The four eye rays include the following:

Fatigue: The target must make a successful Fortitude save or become fatigued. An already fatigued creature that fails this save becomes exhausted.

Inflict Moderate Wounds: This works as the spell, causing 2d8+6 points of damage (Will half).

Hold Monster: This works as the spell.

---

Telepathy: A spectator can communicate telepathically with its target for the round. As a free action, a spectator can make a suggestion (as the spell) to any creature with whom it is currently telepathically speaking.

Spell-Like Abilities: 3/day-create food and water; 1/ day-plane shift (DC 17). Caster level 6th.

Flight (Ex): A spectator's body is naturally buoyant. This buoyancy allows it to fly at a speed of 20 feet. This buoyancy also grants it a permanent feather fall effect (as the spell) with personal range.

Planar Fast Healing (Ex): While in the House of the Triad in the domain of Everwatch, a spectator has fast healing 1.

Spell Turning ( $S u$ ): A spectator's central eye produces a 90 foot cone that reflects spells cast upon it back upon its source. This functions just like spell turning (caster level 6th). Up to one spell can be reflected per round.

Tactics: The spectator is tasked with protecting the contents of the room, and it does not deviate from that task. It knows it has the high ground and a good defensive position from its niche, and it is unlikely to drop down unless forced. That said, the spectator, named Qilnax, is eager to talk to adventurers. It refrains from attacking unless forced to do so by its responsibilities or imminent danger, preferring instead to issue warnings like "If you step in the room, I will be forced to destroy you, and neither of us would like that."

Treasure: The room is filled with a dozen small chests, none of which are locked or trapped. Ten of the chests are filled with nonmagical scrolls detailing the past history and business transactions of House Ilvastarr. These records are not the only copies owned by House Ilvastarr, and individually, they are largely worthless. However, the scrolls might fetch as much as 200 gp from one of the family's merchant rivals. The eleventh chest contains 2,000 gp worth of silver trade bars, worth 50 gp apiece. The twelfth chest contains the griffontack of Belabranta (see below).

Development: Stealing and selling House Ilvastarr's business secrets earns the enmity of that house. Their vengeance is likely to take the form of hired assassins for a total expenditure equal to the value of the lost business (probably in the thousands of gold pieces). Stealing the griffontack of Belabranta is likely to engender the same response, as House Ilvastarr desperately seeks the item's recovery before their complicity in the original theft becomes public. Displaying the griffontack prominently will eventually come to the attention of House Belabranta. The Belabranta family will initially assume that the PCs are not the original thieves, though they will insist that they are "obligated" to return the items to the original owners. Once House Ilvastarr realizes House Belabranta is aware of the item's reemergence, they hire rumormongers to attempt to pin the blame on the player characters.

Griffontack of Belabranta: House Belabranta has long been associated with griffon breeding and taming in the City of Splendors, and its handlers have raised most of the griffons owned by the City Guard of Waterdeep. The members of House Belabranta trace their ancestry back to Ilithrew Belabranta, a hero of the second Trollwar ( 940 DR to 952 DR ) famed for his bravery and prowess on griffonback.

Early in the twelve-year-long war, Ilithrew seized a large cache of coins from the hoard of a giant three-headed troll. He wisely used much of his treasure to commission a set of magic items to increase his effectiveness in battle. These items came to be known as the griffontack of Belabranta. In the aftermath of the Second Trollwar, House Belabranta became part of Waterdeep's merchant nobility, and family patriarchs proudly displayed Ilithrew's tack and lance as a symbol of the house.

In the Year of Crimson Magics (1026 DR), the Black Claw horde emerged from the depths of the Sword Mountains and swept down the Dessarin River valley to encircle the City of Splendors. Nobles and commoners alike died in Battle of BloodDrenched Swords, as the populace of Waterdeep fought to beat back the orc assault. Among those who sacrificed their lives for the city were Lord Palinor Belabranta and his griffon steed. A hail of arrows brought down the brave beast, and his rider vanished into a sea of orcish warriors. After the battle was won, Lord Palinor's heir searched far and wide for his father's body, but it had vanished along with Ilithrew's legendary griffontack. ${ }^{7}$

It has been three centuries since the griffontack of Belabranta was last seen, but the heirs of House Belabranta have never ceased looking for it. For almost as long as it has been missing, they have harbored suspicions that the ancestors of House Ilvastarr plundered Palinor's body in the confusion of the battle and that the griffontack of Belabranta lies unused in the vaults of the Ilvastarr villa. House Ilvastarr of course denies such accusations, suggesting instead that the griffontack lines the hoard of some orcish chieftain, but the bad blood between the two houses stemming from this dispute has never abated.

The griffontack consists of five pieces, all inscribed with the Belabrantan crest: the Belabrantan caparison of warmth", a bit and bridle of griffonriding", a griffon lancesaddle", a lance of burning blackfire", and a ring of feather falling.

### V7: Visageway

This area is accessible only through the secret door in the bottom of pit C in area V2.

The secret door reveals a hand-bewn crawlway bending northward around a corner. As you pass around the corner, you see before you a leering, hideous visage of carved stone at the end of the crawlway. A flickering torch stuck in a sconce near the visage casts a shadowy orange glow. You can just make out the shape of a dark black tome resting on the visage's tongue.

The face is a depiction of Gormauth Souldrinker, an aspect of Gargauth, and the crawlway serves as a tiny chapel. The visage is the center of an iuballow spell with a cause fear spell (DC 13) fixed to it.

Treasure: The torch is a continual flame torch. The black tome appears to be the diary of Lord Ulguth Ilvastarr II, first son of the current patriarch. It is filled with the hateful scribings of a man consumed with bitterness and a lust for power; Ulguth believed he had discovered a dark deity who would give him the great power he felt he deserved. The book is also a cursed magic item, acting as a vacuous grimoire for anyone who peruses it without acknowledging Gargauth as his or her patron deity.

---

cities, such as Bezantur, Silverymoon, and Waterdeep, where wands are fairly plentiful. Many quickly ensconce themselves as the heads of small thieves' guilds specializing in the theft of charged magic items. In the wilds, dweomervores favor sprawling aboveground ruins where adventurers are common (such as Myth Drannor and Shoonach) and they can fly overhead invisibly while searching for targets.

Dweomervores speak Common, Auran, and Draconic, but since they can use tongues as a spell-like ability at will, they rarely have difficulty communicating. These creatures are phenomenally long-lived, and they can reach ages of five hundred years or more if they are careful.

### Combat

Dweomervores lurk in and around ruins, taverns, and other locales frequented by adventurers. They observe potential prey before attempting a theft, hoping to discern which members of a group have charged items, such as wands. A dweomervore attempts to steal as many such items as is possible using its breath weapon from a place of hiding. If discovered, a dweomervore uses any stolen items against their owners before closing to slash with its barbed tail attack. Dweomervores are usually more interested in stealing magic than killing, but if hard pressed, they use all their abilities to defend themselves.

### Breath Weapon (Su)

A dweomervore has a unique telekinetic breath weapon that it can use once every 1 d 4 rounds. It can duplicate the combat maneuver or violent thrust versions of the telekinesis spell (caster level 10th), with a maximum range of 100 feet. Its breath weapon manifests as shimmering golden waves of force.

Since it can affect creatures of up to 250 pounds, the dweomervore can pick up and hurl most creatures of Medium size or smaller (Will DC 15 negates). Against larger creatures, it must employ a combat maneuver or settle for hurling other objects at its target. A dweomervore cannot maintain its telekinetic breath weapon after its turn ends, so it usually chooses maneuvers such as bull rush, trip, or disarm that can be resolved on its turn (its modifier for resolving these attempts is +14 ).

Telekinetic Filch (Su): A dweomervore can use an effect similar to a telekinesis spell to manipulate objects weighing 5 pounds or less at a distance of up to 60 feet. Unattended nonmagical objects receive no saving throw against this attack, but attended or magic objects can attempt a DC 17 Will save to resist. The save DC is Charisma-based. A dweomervore can manipulate objects in this manner with amazing grace, and if it wishes to take an object from a person without being detected, it can make a Sleight of Hand check to do so. Dweomervores  
are fond of stealing improperly stowed wands and scrolls from the pockets of unwary victims by using this ability.

Magic Drain (Su): As a full-round action, a dweomervore can place any charged magic item (for example, staves or wands) in its mouth and consume 1d6 charges. Each charge consumed in this manner is drained without activating any of the object's powers, and each charge so drained cures the dweomervore of 5 points of damage. Excess hit points gained in this manner are gained as temporary hit points, and they persist for 1 hour. A dweomervore can only have a number of temporary hit points equal to its full normal total.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willblur, color spray (DC 15), daze (DC 14), detect magic, identify, invisibility, reduce person (DC 15), see invisibility, obscuring mist, tongues. Caster level 7th. The save DCs are Charismabased.  
Tail Barbs (Ex): A dweomervore's tail is studded with numerous razor-sharp barbs. These barbs can inflict terrible wounds. A wound caused by the creature's tail continues to bleed at the rate of 1 point of damage per round. The bleeding persists until it is magically healed or staunched with a DC 15 Heal check. Multiple hits result in cumulative bleeding damage.

Skills: Dweomervores have a +4 racial bonus on Use Magic Device checks.

This creature looks like a grotesque, winged bumanoid about the size of a balfing, with a borned head and long, curving fangs jutting from its mouth. It seems to be carved from a block of solid stone.

Originally devised by the Zhentarim, guardgoyles are commonly found in tombs, vaults, and manses of wealthy merchants and nobles across Faerûn. They are most frequently encountered in wealthy cities with populations of arcane spellcasters for hire, such as Calimport, Saerloon, Selgaunt, Silverymoon, Waterdeep, and Zhentil Keep.

Created to guard valuable items, guardgoyles protect their charges with absolute loyalty. A guardgoyle can only be commanded to defend a specific item. It remains close by and inert until its is attacked, until its charge is disturbed in any way, or until an intruder takes a specific observable action defined by the creature's master (which might be as simple as "entering this room.") A guardgoyle never pursues intruders farther than 100 feet away from the item it guards. Only the guardgoyle's creator, or those whom the guardgoyle's creator orders it to obey, can assign the creature a new guard task.

A guardgoyle can be directed to ignore certain individuals, who must be easily described or physically present at the time the guardgoyle is given its charge. If an ignored individual moves the guarded item, a guardgoyle will do its best to follow. If a guardgoyle loses track of the item it guards (for instance a keyed individual picks the item up and teleports away), the guardgoyle becomes inert until the item returns or it is given a new charge by its creator.

A guardgoyle is some 3 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds. A guardgoyle cannot speak, but it understands commands given in any language its creator speaks.

### Combat

Guardgoyles are straightforward combatants, shrieking in warning and then attacking with their natural weapons. In the presence of spellcasters they cannot attack directly, they continue to use their shriek ability to disrupt spellcasting.

Construct Traits: A guardgoyle has immunity to poison, magic sleep effects, paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects,  
![img-32.jpeg](assets/City%20of%20Splendors,%20Waterdeep_img-32.jpeg)  
necromancy effects, mind-affecting spells and abilities (charms, compulsions, phantasm, patterns, and morale effects), and any effect that requires a Fortitude save unless it also works on objects or is harmless. It is not subject to critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability damage, ability drain, fatigue, exhaustion, or energy drain. It cannot heal damage, but it can be-repaired. It has darkvision out to 60 feet and low-light vision. Poison (Ex): Injury or contact, Fortitude DC 11, initial and secondary damage 1 d 4 Con . The save DC is Charisma-based. A guardgoyle stores enough poison in its fangs for two poisonous bites. After that, its poison must be replenished. Other types of poison are possible.

Shriek (Su): A guardgoyle can emit an ear-piercing shriek in a cone-shaped burst with a range of 30 feet. Any creature within the area is deafened for 1 d 2 rounds and takes 2 d 6 points of sonic damage. A DC 11 Fortitude save negates the deafening effect and reduces the damage by half. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Alarm (Sp): If an item guarded by a guardgoyle is disturbed in any way, the person who gave the creature its charge receives a mental alarm from the guardgoyle. The range of this ability is 1 mile; if the guardgoyle's master is farther away, he is not warned. The master notes a single mental "ping" that awakens him from normal sleep but does not otherwise disturb concentration. A silence spell has no effect on a mental alarm.

### Construction

A guardgoyle's body is sculpted from granite or basalt and coated with gem dust. The materials cost $1,000 \mathrm{gp}$. The creature's master can assemble the body or hire someone else to do the job. Creating the body requires a DC 20 Craft (sculpting) check or a DC 20 Craft (stonemasonry) check. After the body is sculpted, the guardgoyle is animated through an extended magical ritual that requires a specially prepared laboratory or workroom, similar to an alchemist's laboratory and costing 500 gp to establish. If the creator is personally constructing the creature's body, the building and the ritual can be performed together.

Damage to a guardgoyle can be repaired with a stone shape spell; each such use restores 1 d 8 hit points to the creature. Repair damage spells also work.

CL 7th; Craft Construct, alarm, fly, shout, stone shape, caster must be at least 7th level; Price 4,000 gp; Cost 2,500 gp +120 XP.

This bideously ugly creature has the body and legs of a nine-foot-long stag, the tufted tail of a lion, and a low-slung, wedgeshaped head like that of a giant badger. It has glowing red eyes, a nauseating stench, and it drools loathsomely. Its foul, oily skin is a motley mixture of brown, gray, and black bues, and it has sharp, bony ridges in lieu of teeth.

Leucrottas are the murderous bullies of the wilderness, living in desolate areas far from civilization. Although cunning enough to hunt humans, leucrottas prefer nonintelligent prey that will not have relatives looking for vengeance. Leucrottas regularly hunt more than they can consume, killing for sheer pleasure. Few other creatures will touch a corpse slain by a leucrotta, for their oily skin quickly turns such carcasses rancid and cloaks them in the leucrotta's nauseating stench.

Although leucrottas are normally found in the wilds, a number of the creatures inhabit the middle levels of Undermountain, most notably Skullport. They are allies of the Unseen (see page 57), and they use their guile and talent for mimicry to lure adventurers into ambushes.

Leucrottas can be difficult to track, as their footprints are identical to that of a mature stag.

Leucrotta speak Common, Draconic, and Giant.

### Combat

If it can choose its ground, a leucrotta prefers to fight beside cliffs, ravines, and deep gullies. It attempts to trap a foe with his back to empty air and then bull rushes to knock him back off the edge. A leucrottas often uses Power Attack against lightly armored foes, reducing its attack bonus to +8 and dealing $1 \mathrm{~d} 8+10$ points of damage with its bite.

When fighting intelligent prey, a leucrotta attempts to lure one victim away from its allies and then torture it before killing it. Then, using its mimicry ability, it attempts to lure additional victims away from their fellows by replaying the screams and words of its earlier victim.

Adamantine Bite (Ex): A leucrotta deals bite damage as if its teeth were magic adamantine weapons both for purposes of bypassing the hardness of objects and for overcoming damage reduction. On a critical hit, a leucrotta's bite deals triple damage. A leucrotta often attacks its opponent's weapons and shields.

Immunities: A leucrotta is immune to charm and compulsion effects.

Iron Guts (Ex): A leucrotta can eat almost anything, no matter how rancid. It has a +4 racial bonus on Fortitude saves against disease and poison.

Mimicry (Ex): A leucrotta has the ability to mimic animal cries and voices in any language. It can duplicate the voices of its victims, including screams, with uncanny accuracy. A leucrotta has a +8 racial bonus on Bluff checks made to imitate another creature's voice. A leucrotta uses its Wisdom modifier (instead of Charisma) when making Bluff checks and Disguise checks.  
Sure-Footed (Ex): A leucrotta has a +4 racial bonus on Balance checks, and it ignores movement penalties for moving on slopes. However, a leucrotta lacks hands, and thus cannot climb ropes or vertical walls.  
Skills: A leucrotta has a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks. It can always choose to take 10 on Climb checks, even if rushed or threatened. A leucrottas has a +4 racial bonus on Hide checks in mountainous terrain.

Sometimes known as the greater leucrotta, the changesteed is a leucrotta with doppelganger blood. Changesteeds prefer humanoid flesh and hunt them more avidly than normal leucrottas do.

Changesteeds are frequently encountered in Undermountain and the various sewers and dungeons of Waterdeep, where they often serve the Unseen (see page 57 ).

### Combat

In addition to the special attacks and qualities possessed by normal leucrottas, changesteeds also have the ability to assume the form of other animals and beasts. Changesteeds often kill a horse, hippogriff, or griffon, consume or hide its remains, and pose as the slain creature. The changesteed later attacks its' rider when they reach an isolated locale.

Change Shape (Su): A changesteed can assume the form of a Medium or Large animal or magical beast. In its new form, the changesteed loses its speed, natural attack, and adamantine bite, but gains the speed, natural attacks and extraordinary special attacks of the form assumed; see Monster Manual page 306 for more information. A changesteed can remain in its new form until it chooses  
to assume a new one. A change in form cannot be dispelled, but a changesteed reverts to its natural form when killed. A true seeing spell or ability reveals its true form.

This scorpionlike automaton is fashioned of interlocking iron segments, rust-red and pitted with age. Its deadly tail sparks and fizzles with electrical energy.

Scaladars are the creation of Trobriand the Metal Mage (see page 28), an ex-apprentice of Halaster Blackcloak. Formerly found only in Undermountain, scaladars are beginning to spread to surrounding subterranean and surface areas, either wandering away as aimless killing machines or constructed elsewhere by Trobriand's former apprentices. Trobriand has released a handful of scaladars into the wild, ordering them to kill any living creature they encounter and devour the remains. In recent years, a few solitary scaladars have appeared in the darkest alleys of Waterdeep, sent

---

by Trobriand to dispatch his foes quietly.

Scaladars are often employed as guardians, and they are usually instructed to aid their fellow constructs if they come under attack. Some scaladars are employed as magic hunters, instructed to swallow every magic item they encounter and use force if necessary to do so.

Scaladars are controlled by magic rings known as rings of Trobriand*. Each remains under the strict command of whoever bears the ring of Trobriand* linked to it at the time it was created, and it follows its last set of instructions until instructed otherwise.

### Combat

Scaladars attack first with their claws, preferring to use their improved grab to grapple opponents and then follow with a sting attack against grappled or pinned opponents.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a scaladar must hit with a claw attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking attacks of opportunity.

Shocking Sting (Su): A scaladar deals 1d6 points of electricity damage to creatures hit with its stinger, or 2 d 6 points of electricity damage if its stinger is overcharged due to its electricity absorption ability (see above).

Arcane Sight (Su): Scaladars see magical emanations as if they were under the effects of the arcane sight spell.

Construct Traits: A scaladar has immunity to poison, magic sleep effects, paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects, necromancy effects, mind-affecting spells and abilities (charms, compulsions, phantasm, patterns, and morale effects), and any effect that requires a Fortitude save unless it also works on objects or is harmless. It is not subject to critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability damage, ability drain, fatigue, exhaustion, or energy drain. It cannot heal damage, but it can be repaired. It has darkvision out to 60 feet and low-light vision.

Electricity Absorption (Ex): Scaladars are immune to electricity attacks. If a scaladar is subject to electricity damage, it instead overcharges its shocking sting for a number of minutes equal to the electricity damage dealt. While overcharged, each sting attack the scaladar makes deals extra electricity damage (see above). A scaladar can't overcharge itself or another scaladar with its shocking sting.

Magic Missile Absorption (Ex): Scaladars are healed by magic missile spells, receiving a number of hit points equal to the damage the spell would normally deal.

Skills: Scaladars have a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and a +4 racial bonus on Hide and Spot checks. They can always choose to take 10 on Climb checks, even if rushed or threatened.

### Construction

A scaladar's body is sculpted from 2,000 pounds of pure iron, smelted with rare tinctures and admixtures costing at least $5,000 \mathrm{gp}$. Assembling the body requires a DC 20 Craft (armorsmithing) check or a DC 20 Craft (weaponsmithing) check.

In addition, an existing ring of Trobriand must be employed or a new one created as part of the process. (The cost of doing so is not included in the cost or price of the construct.)  
CL 13th; Craft Construct, arcane sight, limited wish, polymorph any object, protection from energy, shield, caster must be at least 13th level; Price $25,000 \mathrm{gp}$; Cost $15,000 \mathrm{gp} .+$ 800 XP.

This enormous statue made from greenish-brown stone stands almost forty feet tall. Its features are carved in the shape of a vigilant warrior in armor. Its blank eyes glow with a faint silvery sheen.

A walking statue is a mighty construct built for the defense of holy temples, ancient vaults, and the most important cities, castles, and fortresses. It often serves as an ethereal guardian that attacks other ethereal creatures approaching its guarded area.

Unlike most constructs, a walking statue is a free-willed, thinking creature that can reason, learn, and remember. It might pass centuries at a time unmoving but endlessly vigilant, thinking deep and slow thoughts. It understands Common and Draconic, but only speaks if commanded to do so by its creator (or whatever creature it recognizes as an appropriate authority).

A walking statue is unswervingly loyal to its instructions or orders, and it carries them out to the best of its ability.

### Combat

A walking statue is a fearsome opponent, capable of crushing all but the most powerful foes with its immense strength and size. It uses its Awesome Blow and Improved Overrun feats to scatter and knock down smaller opponents. It commonly uses Power Attack against smaller and weaker foes, reducing its attack bonus to $+2 \bar{\tau}$ and increasing its damage to $6 \mathrm{~d} 6+2 \bar{\tau}$.

A walking statue's natural attacks are treated as magic and adamantine weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

Planar Disjunction (Su): Once every 7 rounds, a walking statue can create a planar disjunction in a 120 -foot-radius burst centered on itself. All ethereal creatures and objects within this area (other than the statue itself) must succeed on a DC 26 Will save or be forced onto the Material Plane and stunned for 1 d 4 rounds. Ghosts are forced to manifest when caught in a planar disjunction. Creatures with the ability to return to the Ethereal Plane (or, in the case of a ghost, stop manifesting) cannot do so for 1 full round after being expelled by a planar disjunction.

Construct Traits: A walking statue has immunity to poison, magic sleep effects, paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects, necromancy effects, mind-affecting spells and abilities (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects), and any  
effect that requires a Fortitude save unless it also works on objects or is harmless. It is not subject to critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability damage, ability drain, fatigue, exhaustion, or energy drain. It cannot heal damage, but it can be repaired. It has darkvision out to 60 feet and low-light vision.

Ethereal Jaunt (Su): A walking statue can shift itself and any creature it touches or grapples to or from the Ethereal Plane as a free action. Unwilling creatures touched or grappled by the walking statue are entitled to DC 26 Will saves to resist this effect (if successful, the creature remains on the other plane while the statue shifts away). Once it uses this ability, it must wait 10 minutes before it shifts again.

Fast Healing (Ex): A walking statue heals 5 points of damage each round so long as it has at least 1 hit point. If reduced to 0 hit points, it is destroyed.

See Invisibility (Su): A walking statue can continuously use see invisibility, as the spell.

### Construction

A walking statue is a great colossus made of dense stone, usually dolomite or andesite. It stands 40 feet tall and weighs about 1,000 tons. The stone must be of good quality, and costs $50,000 \mathrm{gp}$. Assembling the body requires a DC $2 \bar{\tau}$ Craft (sculpting) or Craft (stonemasonry) check.

This eight-legged, eight-eyed arachnid has a sleek body, large head and fangs, and an excessively hairy body and legs. Its eyes gleam with feral intelligence, suggestive of a preternatural cunning.  
Watchspiders are fairly common in the cellars and warehouses of guild houses and rich merchants. They are trained to obey a single master, who can order them not to attack certain beings. All watchspiders are schooled in disabling spellcasters and in avoiding weapons set against their leap attack (spears and large piercing weapons). Moreover, they can be trained so that most attack while another rings an alarm bell or drinks from a basin containing a magic potion before joining a fight.

Watchspiders are indigenous to Tharsult, where the natives first trained the species as guards. The Mhairuun merchant family brought watchspiders and their breeding and training processes north to Waterdeep, swiftly establishing a lucrative business with this rare commodity. After sixty years of breeding in the North, watchspiders can be found in Sword Coast cities from Neverwinter to Lantan, all purchased and shipped from Waterdeep. While still a creature of more temperate climes, watchspiders have adapted to the Sword Coast with the growth of heavier hair (almost fur), but they still cannot survive the cold any further north than Neverwinter.

A watchspider can serve asa $n$ animal companion (if the character has an effective druid level of 4 th or higher), a familiar (at 3rd level or higher, with the Improved Familiar feat), or a mount.

### Combat

Watchspiders spin webs to use as lairs but rove about hunting prey. They exhibit more of a pack mentality than true vermin and a degree of coordination unknown to their mindless relatives.

Poison (Ex): Injury, Fortitude DC 13; initial and secondary damage $1 \mathrm{~d} 4$ Str. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Web (Ex): A watchspider often waits in its web or in a tree, then lowers itself silently on silk strands and leaps onto prey passing beneath. A single strand is strong enough to support a spider and one creature of the same size.

A watchspider can move across its own web at its climb speed and can pinpoint the location of any creature touching its web.

Skills: Watchspiders have a +4 racial bonus on Hide checks, a +8 racial bonus on Climb and Spot checks, and a +10 racial bonus on Jump checks. A watchspider can always choose to take 10 on Climb checks, even if rushed or threatened. Watchspiders use either their Strength or Dexterity modifier for Climb checks, whichever is higher.

This storklike creature has long blue legs and a ravenlike head with a sharp, straight beak. The creature's plumage is breathtaking, with thin, prismatic feathers cascading down its back. It has a magnificent, brightly colored crest and long tailfeathers similar to those of a bird of paradise.

The wilora is a cunning and deceptive creature that can steal the memories of those who meet its gaze; it can then assume the form of its victims at will. Wiloras are not uncommon in large cities of the southern Realms. They have recently appeared in Waterdeep thanks to the machinations of the Unseen (see page 57). Wiloras are said to be a

---

creation of Beshaba, formed from the eggs of tropical birds that have been soaked in the blood of doppelgangers. Indeed, the similarity between the wilora's abilities and those of a doppelganger seems more than coincidental.

Wiloras commonly adopt the guise of a local species of bird, and then search for particularly interesting or intriguing individuals from which to steal hedonistic or amusing memories. Wiloras are sometimes befriended by thieves' guilds; their unusual talents can be used to great effect in the creation of alibis, the blackmailing of wealthy targets, and the extraction of information from prisoners or public officials. However, should that relationship falter, a wilora can do great damage by exposing the guild's criminal activities.

Wiloras speak Common, Auran, and any languages known by the form they take using their alternate form ability.

### Combat

A wilora forced into combat in its natural form relies heavily on its hypnotic song-it is far from a dangerous creature in melee. When forced into melee in its true form, it claws with its talons and hopes for the best. A wilora hides and rests during the day. At night, the wilora takes full advantage of its alternate forms when forced into combat. If it doesn't have access to a humanoid form, a cornered wilora is quick to assume the form of a birdlike beast to fight more effectively.

Hypnotic Song (Su): While in its true form, as a full-round action a wilora can trill à captivating song that affects all living creatures within a 30 -foot spread. Such creatures must succeed on a DC 14 Will save or become entranced by the song as if by a hypnotism spell. This is a mind-affecting sonic attack. The save DC is Charisma-based. A bard's countersong ability allows a hypnotized creature to attempt a new Will save.

Memory-Snatching Gaze (Su): If a wilora meets the gaze of a helpless or willing target (such as a target that has been hypnotized by its song) within 30 feet, the victim must succeed on a DC 14 Will saving throw, or its memories and knowledge become accessible to the wilora through an intrusive telepathic link. The save DC is Charisma-based. After the link is established, closing one's eyes, being blinded, or looking away from the wilora's gaze has no effect, but moving more than 30 feet away breaks the link. Each round the victim can attempt a new saving throw to break the link, but in each round when the victim fails the saving throw, the wilora learns the answer to one question to the best of the victim's knowledge. These questions are posed telepathically, and the answers are imparted directly to the wilora's mind. Once a victim makes a Will save against the wilora's gaze, it becomes immune to that particular wilora's gaze for 24 hours.

Unlike most gaze attacks, this gaze attack requires the wilora's concentration; it cannot target more than one creature in a round. A wilora can use its memory-snatching ability only while in its true form. The ability is a mind-affecting attack.

Alternate Form (Su): A wilora is bound to its true form during the day, but after nightfall it gains the ability to polymorph at will as a move action into any bird or birdlike  
magical beast of Large or smaller size (including giant eagles, giant owls, griffons, hippogriffs, or owlbears). It can remain in that form until daybreak, if it wishes.

In addition, if a wilora has successfully used its memorysnatching gaze during the current night, it can assume the form of the last creature upon which it successfully used its memory-snatching gaze. This ability works as the polymorph. spell, except as noted above. A wilora can take the form of any Large or smaller creature allowed by that spell.

Resistant to Enchantment Spells: A wilora has a +4 racial bonus on all saving throws against enchantment spells and effects.

This creature's transparent form resembles a waterlogged cloak. A barely discernible pair of shadowy eyes and a ragged maw peek out from within its drawn hood.

Sea wraiths are cloaklike spirits that guard the treasures of the depths. They are servitors of Umberlee, the Bitch Queen. In Waterdeep, they serve as guardians of Umberlee's Cache (see page 120), dwelling in the lightless depths of Deepwater Harbor. They attack anyone who violates the sanctity of the Bitch Queen's tithing-place, but they do not pursue interlopers who flee the Cache and its immediate vicinity. Some say they push or pull their victims deeper into the Cache to make them sacrifices to Umberlee.

A sea wraith cannot speak, although those who escape its grip claim to have heard an infernal moaning that nearly overwhelmed their senses.

---

### Combat

A sea wraith attacks with its chill touch, and it takes full advantage of its dark environment, often attacking from a nonstandard location, such as from directly beneath or above a victim, since many targets are not used to fighting in an aquatic environment. (As an incorporeal creature, a sea wraith can move and fight in water with no penalty.) A sea wraith always seeks to surround a humanoid foe and destroy it with its deep chill ability.

Create Spawn (Su):  
Any humanoid reduced to 0 Strength by a sea wraith dies and becomes a sea wraith in 2d4 rounds unless the body is removed from the water or a protection from evil spell is cast upon the body before the transformation occurs. The new sea wraith possesses no abilities or memories of life, nor is it under any command other than to kill those who would approach or touch the treasures that it guards.

Surround (Ex): As a standard action, a sea wraith can attempt to surround a single opponent of its size or smaller. It does not need to make a touch attack during the round in which it attempts to surround its foe.  
![img-33.jpeg](assets/City%20of%20Splendors,%20Waterdeep_img-33.jpeg)

A surrounded foe is not grappled or prevented from moving, but if it moves, the sea wraith automatically moves with it. In order to free itself, a surrounded foe must move into sunlight (in which case the wraith releases it immediately and flees for darkness at the first opportunity) or attempt to escape as a standard action. The victim makes an Escape Artist check, opposed by the sea wraith's touch attack modifier (usually +6 ).

Deep Chill (Su): A sea wraith that surrounds a victim or that begins its turn surrounding a victim cloaks its opponent in the chill of the abyssal depths, dealing 3d6 points of cold damage and 1d4 points of Strength damage per round. A successful Fortitude save reduces the cold damage by half and negates the Strength damage.

Incorporeal Traits: A sea wraith is harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, magic weapons, spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. It has a $50 \%$ chance to ignore any damage from a corporeal source, except for force effects or attacks made with ghost touch weapons. It can pass through solid objects, but not force effects, at will. Its attacks ignore natural armor, armor, and shields, but deflection bonuses and force effects work normally against it. An incorporeal creature always moves silently and cannot be heard with Listen checks if it doesn't wish to be.

Sunlight Powerlessness (Ex): A sea wraith is utterly powerless in natural sunlight (not merely a daylight spell) and flees from it. A sea wraith in natural sunlight immediately releases an engulfed victim.

Undead Traits: A sea wraith is immune to mind-affecting spells and abilities, poison, magic sleep effects, paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects, and any effect that requires a Fortitude save unless it also works on objects or is harmless. It is not subject to critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability damage to its physical ability scores, ability drain, energy drain, fatigue, exhaustion, or death from massive damage. It cannot be raised, and resurrection works only if it is willing. It has darkvision out to 60 feet.

Skills: A sea wraith is nigh-invisible in its underwater environment and has a +8 racial bonus on Hide checks in aquatic environments.

from devout servants of Waterdeep's temples to blue-blooded noble dilettantes and callous street-smart rogues, Waterdhavian adventurers often spend their entire careers within twenty miles of the City of Splendors.

## Feats

The feats described in this section are commonplace in the City of Splendors and are summarized in Table 7-1.

### DUNGEONEC'’s Intuition

You can sense when things don't feel right, and you have a knack for avoiding deadly traps and sudden ambushes.

Prerequisites: Wisdom 13, trap sense class feature.  
Benefit: You add your Wisdom bonus to your trap sense bonus. In addition, you can apply your trap sense bonus to your $A C$ during a surprise round (although you still might be flatfooted if you were not aware of your foes before they struck).

### Table 7-1: New Feats

| General Feats | Prerequisites | Benefit |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Dungeoneer's Intuition | Wis 13, trap sense | Add Wisdom bonus to trap sense; add trap sense <br> bonuses to AC during surprise round |
| Hand of Tyr | Patron Tyr, alignment lawful good, <br> ability to turn undead | +1 sacred bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, <br> and Will saves |
| Jester's Magic | Perform (comedy) 8 ranks, <br> spellcasting ability | +1 caster level for jester's magic |
| Lunar Magic | Patron deity Selûne or Mystra, <br> arcane or divine spellcasting ability | Caster level varies with phase of the moon |
| Veil of Cyric | Any evil, not an outsider, cannot <br> worship an evil god | Not detected as evil unless detector's aura strength <br> exceeds yours |
| Initiate Feat | Prerequisites | Benefit |
| Initiate of Shar | Blackguard level 1st or cleric level 3rd, <br> patron deity Shar | Knowledge (arcana) and Knowledge (dungeoneering) <br> are class skills; new spells added to cleric/blackguard <br> spell lists |

---

### Hand of Ty'r

You have sacrificed your right hand to Tyr, the Maimed God, proving your resilience and strength of spirit. Most who take this feat wrap their right hands in white gauze, voluntarily refraining from using the hand. Others have lost their hand in battle, and a few fanatical followers of the Maimed God choose to cut off their hand to demonstrate their zeal and devotion to Tyr's faith.

Prerequisites: Patron Tyr, alignment lawful good, ability to turn undead.

Benefit: As long as you refrain from using your right hand, you receive a +1 sacred bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, and Will saves.

Since you are using only one hand, you cannot fight with two weapons, wield a two-handed weapon, or fight with a one-handed weapon and a heavy shield. You can fight with a one-handed weapon and a light shield, but you cannot use your shield hand to hold other objects such as a holy symbol, spell components, or a light source. (This means you must use your weapon hand to cast spells, so you might have to drop or sheathe a weapon when you wish to cast a spell requiring your holy symbol or somatic components.) You take a -4 penalty on Climb, Disable Device, Open Lock, and Tumble checks. You can only gain the benefit of wearing one magic ring.  
(If you previously considered yourself right-handed, you suffer no penalty for using your left hand as your primary hand. Handedness isn't defined in the game; the point of the vow is to restrict yourself to using one hand.)

Special: If you violate your oaths and use your right hand for any purpose, you lose the benefits of this feat until you perform a rite of purification in a shrine or temple of Tyr, which requires 24 hours of vigil and prayer.

### Initiate of Shar [initiate]

You have been initiated into the greatest secrets of Shar's church.

Prerequisite: Able to cast 1st-level divine spells, patron deity Shar.

Benefit: You add Bluff and Hide to your list of class skills.

In addition, you add the following spells to your divine spellcaster spell list. If you have more than one divine spellcasting class before taking this feat, you must decide which class has the additional spells added to its list.

1st Disguise Self: Changes your appearance. 3rd Crushing Despair: Subject takes -2 on attack rolls, damage rolls, saves, and checks.

4th Armor of Darkness: Creates a shroud of shadow around target that grants darkvision, a bonus to AC, and a bonus on some saving throws.  
5th Darkbolt: One beam of darkness/2 levels deals damage and dazes opponents.

Special: The armor of darkness and darkbolt spells also appear on the Darkness domain list. With this feat, you can cast them as regular cleric spells, not just domain spells.

### Jester's Magic

You are a skilled master of magical jests, capable of inciting audiences to laughter or lulling them to sleep.

Prerequisites: Perform (acting) 8 ranks, ability to cast arcane spells.

Benefit: Choose either the bardic jester tradition or the jester mage tradition. You gain +1 caster level when casting a spell from the list below for your tradition.

The bardic tradition of jester's magic includes the following bard spells at the appropriate levels: 0 -prestidigitation; 1stremove fear, hypnotism, Tasha's bideous laughter; 2nd-calm emotions, enthrall; 3rd-confusion, glibness; 4th-modify memory; 5th-mass suggestion; 6th-Otto's irresistible dance.  
![img-35.jpeg](assets/City%20of%20Splendors,%20Waterdeep_img-35.jpeg)

Taking the Hand of Tyr feat is a measure of devotion, not a bandicap.

---

The mage tradition of jester's magic includes the following sorcerer/wizard spells at the appropriate levels: 0 -prestidigitation; 1st-grease, bypnotism; 2nd-Tasha's bideous laughter, rope trick; 3rd-deep slumber, suggestion; 4th-confusion; 5th-seeming; 6th-mass suggestion; 7th-project image; 8th-Otto's irresistible dance; 9th-weird.

### LUNa $\Gamma$ MAGiC

Your spells and spell-like abilities are tied to the phase of the moon, rising and falling with the strength of Selûne.

Prerequisite: Patron deity Selûne or Mystra, arcane or divine spellcaster level 1st.

Benefit: As shown in the table below, your effective caster level for all spells you cast or spell-like abilities you possess is tied to the phase of the moon.

For purposes of this feat, the new moon and full moon are considered to last three successive nights (the night before, the night of, and the night after the true full moon or new moon). Since Selûne's month is almost exactly as long as the calendar month, the moon is always full right at the beginning of the month, and dark right in the middle of the month, as shown below.

| Moon Phase | Days of the Month | Effective Caster Level |
| :-- | :--: | :--: |
| New Moon | $15,16,17$ | -1 |
| Full | $30,1,2$ | +1 |

### Veil of Cyric

You have reconciled yourself to the unfortunate truth that hard decisions and regrettable actions are necessary in the service of your deity. You intrinsically rationalize any nongood act, believing your actions to be just and pure.

Prerequisite: Any evil alignment, not an outsider, cannot worship an evil god.

Benefit: You do not register as evil to detect evil spells, spell-like abilities, or supernatural abilities unless the aura power (see the detect evil spell, Player's Handbook page 218) of the detector exceeds your own. For example, the aura power of a paladin 7 /blackguard 1 is moderate, so a good-aligned cleric would need to be 9 th level to detect his evil nature.

This feat provides no benefit against attempts to smite evil or spells such as holy smite or holy word. You are evil, you simply do not register as such to most detect evil attempts.

### Magic Items

Many magic items in common use today were once exclusively associated with the City of Splendors. Common and rare examples include the dagger of homing (usually a +1 or +2 returning dagger), the eye of the druutbhane ${ }^{\text {M46 }}$, Laeral's spell shield ${ }^{\text {M46 }}$, Laeral's storm armor ${ }^{\text {M46 }}$, the thunderstaff ${ }^{\text {PG }}$, and the trollkiller sword (usually a +1 flaming longsword). Some uniquely Waterdhavian artifacts have wandered far afield, such as Azureedge ${ }^{\text {M46 }}$, Slayer of the Netherborn, and the reformed Crown of Horns ${ }^{\text {M46 }}$. Detailed hereafter are Art-crafted objects and properties still exclusively (or nearly so) associated with

Waterdeep and unique items believed to be found within the City of Splendors.

### Weapon Special Abilities

In addition to the special abilities described on page 223-226 of the Dungeon Master's Guide, the following abilities are relatively commonplace for weapons made in Waterdeep.

Corrosive: Upon command, a corrosive weapon becomes slick with a thick layer of acidic fluid (the wielder takes no damage from this effect). Corrosive weapons deal an extra 1 d 6 points of acid damage on a successful hit.

Bows, crossbows, and slings with this ability bestow the acid energy upon their ammunition.

Moderate conjuration or evocation; CL 10th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, acid fog, acid storm, Melf's acid arrow, or storm of vengeance; Price +1 bonus.

Harmonizing: This enchantment can only be placed on melee weapons. A harmonizing weapon accompanies its wielder in song if drawn, granting a +6 enhancement bonus on Perform checks that involve singing. Beginning on the second round of singing, the harmonizing weapon begins to sing alongside the wielder. If the wielder stops singing at any time after the second round, the weapon continues singing for a number of rounds equal to the wielder's Charisma bonus or until sheathed. This extended singing is equivalent in effect to the wielder continuing to sing.

For example, a bard with a 16 Charisma could start singing for 1 round to inspire courage in his allies. In the second round, his harmonizing weapon would join in. If the bard stopped singing in the third round, the harmonizing weapon would sing for up to 3 additional rounds, continuing to inspire courage in the bard's allies. If the bard restarted his song any time before the end of the 6 th round, the harmonizing weapon would continue to sing with him, uninterrupted. (Restarting the song in this manner does not count as another use of bardic music.) If you start using another form of bardic music while your harmonizing weapon is maintaining a song, the weapon stops maintaining the first song and begins aiding the second.

Faint illusion; CL 5th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, ghost sound; Price +1 bonus.

Shattermantle: A shattermantle weapon damages an opponent's spell resistance. Each time the weapon strikes a foe with spell resistance, the value of that spell resistance is reduced by 2 for 1 round. The penalties for multiple hits during the same round stack. For example, if the wielder succeeds on three attacks in the same round against the same foe with spell resistance, that foe's spell resistance is reduced by 6 until the beginning of the wielder's next turn. This weapon property does not grant the bearer the ability to determine how much spell resistance (if any) a target might have.

Faint abjuration; CL 5th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Spell Penetration; Price +1 bonus.

Spellstrike: A spellstrike weapon allows the wielder to transfer some or all of the weapon's enhancement bonus as a bonus on his saving throws against spells and spell-like abilities. As a

---

free action, the wielder chooses how to allocate the weapon's enhancement bonus at the start of his turn before using the weapon, and the effect on saving throws lasts until his next turn. This bonus stacks with all other bonuses that benefit the wielder's saving throws.

Moderate abjuration; CL 8th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, resistance; Price +1 bonus.

Sundering: A sundering weapon deals an extra 1d6 points of damage on a successful sunder attempt. This property can only be added to a slashing or bludgeoning weapon.

Moderate evocation; CL 10th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, shatter; Price +1 bonus.

### Specific Mopic

### Weapons

Over the years, Waterdhavians have crafted a wide range of magic weapons, many of them for use in battle against orcs and trolls. The following is a brief sampling of rare and unique magic weapons found within the City of Splendors.

Axe of Heavenly Fire: This Large + 2 holy greataxe sheds light equivalent to a light spell (bright illumination in a 20 -foot radius, shadowy illumination in a 40 -foot radius) and is considered sacred to Tyr. It was given to Madeiron Sunderstone (see page 34) by Lord High Justiciar High Avenger Deren Eriach of the Abbey of the Just Hammer in Tasseldale.

Moderate evocation; CL 15th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, holy smite, creator must be good; Price $50,340 \mathrm{gp}$; Cost $25,340 \mathrm{gp}+2,000 \mathrm{XP}$; Weight 16 lb .

Bow of Hosark: Carved from an unknown creamy-white wood resembling ivory, this unique weapon has been in the possession of Travis Deepdell for over thirty years, despite the efforts of Elaith Craulnober and others to steal it. No sages have been able to identify the bow's origin, and legend lore spells only produce the beautiful illusion of an elf maiden's face that cryptically asks the bearer to "take care of the Horn of Moon's Dawning." Some rangers and druids who gaze at the bow see a faint carved outline of a unicorn's head along its outer curve, suggesting the weapon is connected in some way to Mielikki or Lurue.

The bow of Hosark is a beautiful +2 distance mighty composite longbow ( +5 Str bonus). When the bow is held or worn over the back, it acts as an amulet of proof against detection and location. Two times per day, the wielder can add the brilliant energy special ability to any arrow shot from the bow (so long as the total arrow bonus, including the brilliant energy special ability, does not exceed +10 ).

Strong transmutation; CL 15th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Wondrous Item, clairaudience/clairvoyance,  
continual flame, gaseous form, nondetection; Price 102,900 gp; Cost $51,900 \mathrm{gp}+4,080 \mathrm{XP}$; Weight 3 lb .

Ettin Axe of Uruth: This unique +1 icy burst/+1 flaming burst orc double axe is imbued with two sentiences, Ur and Krypt, respectively, and can illuminate its surroundings at will as a torch.

Ur: AL LE; Int 14, Wis 14, Cha 10; speaks Common, Orc, and Troll; 120-ft. vision and hearing; Ego score 9.

Lesser Power: Item has 10 ranks in Sense Motive (total modifier +12 ) and 10 ranks in Spellcraft (total modifier +12 ).

Krypt: AL CE; Int 14, Wis 10, Cha 14; speaks Common, Orc, and Troll; 120-ft. vision and hearing; Ego score 9.

Lesser Power: Item has 10 ranks in Intimidate (total modifier +12 ) and 10 ranks in Bluff (total modifier +12 ).

Although one axe head is lawful evil and one axe head is chaotic evil, the weapon is considered neutral evil for purposes of determining which bearers can wield it. If the heads work in concert, which is rare, the item's ego is considered equal to 13 .

Fashioned by Lethchauntos the Black and and wielded by King Uruth before his death in the Battle of the Westwood, this orc double axe is famous for the endless verbal spats between its twin personalities. Most intelligent items try their best to mislead or distract their host so that she ignores or destroys rival items within 60 feet. This common trait manifests in the ettin axe of Uruth in the form of nigh-constant attempts to denigrate the other sentience.

Claimed by War Lord Gharl in the aftermath of the Orcfastings War, but quickly interred and forgotten in the depths of Nimoar's Hold, the ettin axe of Uruth vanished during the Siege of the Black Horde, apparently stolen by orc infiltra-  
tors. Subsequent divinations performed after the weapon was stolen revealed only that the double axe remained within Waterdeep, suggesting that the Black Horde interlopers had failed to escape with this potent symbol of orc might. The weapon's current location and recent history remain unknown.

Strong evocation; CL 15th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, either chill metal or ice storm, either flame blade, flame strike, or fireball; Price $64,660 \mathrm{gp}$; Cost $32,660 \mathrm{gp}+2,560 \mathrm{XP}$; Weight 15 lb .

Gurt's Greataxe: In the Year of the Icy Axe (123 DR), Gurt, Lord of the Pale Giants, fell to Uthgar Gardolfsson-leader the folk who would become the Uthgardt barbarians-in an epic battle that marked the ascendance of humankind over the giants in the Dessarin River valley. Gurt's greataxe is said to have been buried in Morgur's Mound until the Second Trollwar, when it was brought back to Waterdeep by Amphail the Just.

---

After decades of obscurity, lying forgotten in the city's vaults, Piergeiron gave the legendary weapon to Harshnag the Grim in recognition of his service to Waterdeep.

Gurt's greataxe is a Large +1 buman bane thundering greataxe. It sheds light as a torch when the temperature drops below $0^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$. It cannot be concealed when drawn, nor can its light be shut off in these conditions. Once per day, the greataxe can use a chill metal effect upon command.

Moderate conjuration; CL 8th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, blindness/deafness, chill metal, summon monster 1; Price $22,660 \mathrm{gp}$; Cost $11,500 \mathrm{gp}+893 \mathrm{XP}$; Weight 24 lb .

Lance of Burning Blackfire: Favored by the griffon-riders of Waterdeep, these otherwise rare +1 corrosive flaming heavy lances are fashioned from the trunk of a zalantar or "blackwood" tree and inscribed with sacred runes of Mystra. (Zalantar has the properties of darkwood, as detailed in Magic of Faerûn and the Dungeon Master's Guide.)

Moderate evocation; CL 10th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, acid fog, acid storm, Melf's acid arrow, or storm of vengeance, and flame blade, flame strike, or fireball; Price 18,410 gp; Cost $9,410 \mathrm{gp}+720 \mathrm{XP}$; Weight 5 lb .

Magebane: This intelligent +2 bastard sword is made of an unusual black metal, hilt and blade all one piece. Runes of green fire twist up and down the blade endlessly, but the blade does not otherwise glow. Forged during the Seventh Age of Calimshan as a sword of state for one of the ruling mameluks, Magebane was employed to hunt down wizards of the qysar's court who survived the fall of the Imperium. Its last owner was a satrap of Manshaka who died nearly a century ago, and the blade has been missing ever since. Only Keilier Twistbeard knows that it lies in the Blue Alley (see page 115), a seeming reward for anyone who survives the deathtrap.

Magebane: AL NE; Int 17, Wis 10, Cha 17; speaks Auran, Alzhedo, and Common; telepathy; 120-ft. darkvision and hearing; Ego score 16.

Lesser Powers: Detect magic at will, item has 10 ranks in Knowledge [arcana] (total modifier +13 ) and Spot (total modifier +13 ).

Special Purpose: Defeating or slaying arcane spellcasters (including spellcasting monsters and those that use spell-like abilities).

Dedicated Power: Feeblemind.  
Strong transmutation; CL 4th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor; Price 102,935 gp; Cost $51,635 \mathrm{gp}+2,052 \mathrm{XP}$; Weight 6 lb .

Muiral's Decapitator: Custom-made by Halaster for Muiral (see page 28) during his days as the Mad Mage's bodyguard, this +3 adamantine vorpal greatsword is now a Large weapon, as Muiral had it reforged by a renegade of Clan Melairkyn after his transformation. Magic items touched or struck by the blade glow with a pale radiance for $1 \mathrm{~d} 4+1$ rounds. Muiral's decapitator is still in Muiral's possession, and given the power and temperament of its owner, it's probably not going anywhere else soon.

Strong necromancy and transmutation; CL 18th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, detect magic, circle of death, keen edge; Price $135,400 \mathrm{gp}$; Cost $67,900 \mathrm{gp}+5,400 \mathrm{XP}$; Weight 16 lb .

Quarterstaff of Alcedor: Custom-made by Alcedor Kolat for his own use, this 7 -foot-long +3 spellstrike $)+3$ sbattermantle quarterstaff is made from a gnarled duskwood branch with its ends shod in brass.  
Moderate evocation; CL 10th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, shatter, resistance; Price 64,600 gp; Cost $32,600 \mathrm{gp}+$ 2,560 XP; Weight 4 lb .

Spiked Gauntlet of Ulbaerag: This unique +3 wounding spiked gauntlet drips blood for as long as a victim wounded by it continues to bleed. (The victim suffers damage from the wounding effect normally.)

After serving as the symbol of authority in Bloodhand Hold for Ulbaerag and his successors, the gauntlet was lost during Nimoar's sacking of the settlement. The Shadow Thieves found it centuries later, and the Citadel of the Bloody Hand (see page 116) is the gauntlet's namesake. Ulbaerag's gauntlet was lost again after the Shadow Thieves were banished from Waterdeep, but the weapon is believed to remain within the City of Splendors.

Moderate evocation; CL 10th; Craft 'Magic Arms and Armor, Mordenkainen's sword; Price 50,305 gp; Cost 25,305 $\mathrm{gp}+2,000 \mathrm{XP}$; Weight 1 lb .

Viperfang: Custom-built to the Black Viper's specifications by Hadrhune, making it a Shadow Magic item, this unique black +2 corrosive assassin's dagger of venom has a curved blade and serrated edge. It allows the wielder to use a poison effect (as the spell, save DC 14) upon a creature struck by the blade once per day. The wielder can decide to use the power after he has struck. Doing so is a free action, but the poison effect must be invoked in the same round that the dagger strikes. In addition, the dagger provides a +1 bonus to the DC of the Fortitude save forced by the death attack of an assassin.

Moderate necromancy; CL 15th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, acid fog, acid storm, Melf's acid arrow, or storm of vengeance, poison; Price $50,302 \mathrm{gp}$; Cost $25,302 \mathrm{gp}+2,000 \mathrm{XP}$; Weight 4 lb .

### RING'S

Magic rings found in or around Waterdeep include the following.

Ring of Armor: These rings come in three varieties. A ring of light armor is equivalent to a ring of protection +1 with the light fortification armor special ability. A ring of medium armor is equivalent to a ring of protection +1 with the medium fortification armor special ability. A ring of heavy armor is equivalent to a ring of protection +1 with the heavy fortification armor special ability. Other varieties, with larger deflection bonuses, exist as well.

Strong abjuration; CL 13th; Forge Ring, limited wish or miracle, shield of faith, caster must be of a level at least three times greater than the deflection bonus of the ring; Price 8,000 gp (light), 32,000 gp (medium), 72,000 gp (heavy); Weight -.

Ring of Research: A ring of research is a simple gold or silver ring set with a colored gemstone. When worn, it enables the wearer to quickly and unerringly find the right page in the right book or scroll to answer any question, assuming the

---

wearer has access to a library that actually contains the answer. The practical effect of this power is to double the circumstance bonus on Knowledge checks given by access to a library. (If no such bonus is specified, assume the ring of research gives a +2 bonus.)

Faint divination; CL 5th; Forge Ring, legend lore; Price $2,500 \mathrm{gp}$; Weight -.

Ring of Trobriand: A ring of Trobriand enables the wearer to issue mental commands to one or more scaladars. A ring of Trobriand can issue mental commands only to a scaladar it was associated with during the creation process.

Strong evocation; CL 13th; Forge Ring, sending; Price 2,000 gp; Weight -.

### Staffs

Magic staffs associated with Waterdeep include Morgan's staff, the staff of banishment, and the staff of rejecting.

Morgan's Staff: Laeral Arunsun crafted this staff, although why she calls it Morgan's staff in her guise as Irusyl Eraneth is unclear. Fashioned of polished cherry and walnut twined together into a solid shaft, this +1 thundering $/+1$ shock quarterstaff allows the use of the following spells:  
baleful polymorph ( 1 charge)  
chain lightning ( 1 charge)  
thunderlance ( 1 charge)  
Strong evocation; CL 11th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Staff, baleful polymorph, blindness/deafness, chain lightning, thunderlance; Price $57,069 \mathrm{gp}$; Cost $28,835 \mathrm{gp}+2,259$ XP; Weight 4 lb .

Staff of Banishment: Savengriff of Waterdeep (see page 31) has crafted at least a dozen of these short staves, giving them to Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun and others. A staff of banishment, usually made of shadow-wood, allows the use of the following spells:  
banishment ( 2 charges)  
dismissal ( 1 charge)  
repulsion ( 2 charges)  
slow ( 1 charge)  
Strong abjuration; CL 13th; Craft Staff, banishment, dismissal, repulsion, slow; Price $47,532 \mathrm{gp}$; Weight 1 lb .

Staff of Rejecting: Trobriand has crafted several of these finely carved ivory sticks. A staff of rejection allows the use of the following spell:

Trobriand's baleful teleport* (2 charges)  
Most such staves are somehow "keyed" to a sublevel of Undermountain known as "Trobriand's Graveyard" and cannot be used to send the target anywhere else.

Strong conjuration; CL 11th; Prerequisites: Craft Staff, Trobriand's baleful teleport; Price 12,375 gp; Weight 1 lb .

### Wondrous Items

As one might expect, Waterdeep is also home to a bewildering variety of unique or unusual wondrous items.

Amulet of Alcedor: This amulet, consisting of a large sapphire carved in the shape of a clenched fist hung on a chain  
of platinum links, was crafted by Alcedor Kolat and is always clasped about his neck. The amulet allows the wearer to cast bold person (Will save DC 14) at will. Held victims are also affected by a vampiric touch spell.

Moderate enchantment; CL 13th; Craft Wondrous Item, bold person, vampiric touch; Price $318,500 \mathrm{gp}$; Weight -.

Amulet of Fire Breath: This amulet, fashioned in shape of a miniature gold dragon's head, allows the wearer to breathe fire, as the spell 'Palarandusk's fire breath', three times per day.

Faint evocation; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, 'Palarandusk's fire breath'; Price 10,800 gp; Weight -.

Amulet of the Watch: This amulet, fashioned in shape of a miniature shield emblazoned with the crest of Waterdeep, allows the wearer to use whispering wind once per day. Watch captains use the amulet to summon help from the Watch or Guard barracks when needed.

Faint evocation; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, whispering wind; Price 2,160 gp; Weight -.

Belabrantan Caparison of Warmth: A Belabrantan caparison of warmth is a large ornate cloth fashioned of red silk and emblazoned with the heraldic device of House Belabranta (a white field with a light blue stream and purple netting).

A Belabrantan caparison of warmth keeps both a steed and its rider comfortably warm in extreme temperatures as if they had endure elements cast upon them.

This item takes up space on a griffon's body as a robe.  
Faint abjuration; CL 1st; Craft Wondrous Item, endure elements; Price 3,000 gp; Weight 5 lb .

Bit and Bridle of Griffonriding: A bit and bridle of griffonriding gives the rider of a griffon a +10 circumstance bonus on Ride checks.

This item takes up space on a griffon's body as an amulet, brooch, medallion, necklace, periapt, or scarab.

Faint conjuration; CL 1st; Craft Wondrous Item; mount; Price 5,000 gp; Weight 2 lb .

Gauntlets of Weaponry Arcane: These gauntlets are made of dragonhide filigreed with silver thread in the shape of magic runes. They grant the wearer the ability to cast magic weapon at will on a single melee weapon. The effect lasts as long as the weapon is in contact with at least one gauntlet, and the gauntlets cannot affect more than one weapon at a time.

Faint transmutation; CL 1st; Craft Wondrous Item, magic weapon; Price $2,000 \mathrm{gp}$; Weight 4 lb .

Griffon Badge of Waterdeep: These amulets, fashioned in the form of silver cloak clasps inscribed with a griffon rampant above the arms of Waterdeep, are given to every member of Waterdeep's griffon cavalry. A griffon badge allows the wearer to use feather fall, as the spell, once per day. The spell effect can be triggered as an immediate action (see page 80), even if it isn't the rider's turn.

Faint evocation; CL 1st; Craft Wondrous Item, feather fall; Price 400 gp; Weight -.

Griffon Lancesaddle: This exotic military saddle is customdesigned for griffon riding. It appears to have six small leather cylinders, akin to leather scroll tubes, affixed to it. Each of the tubes actually contains an extradimensional space capable of holding a single heavy lance (or other item of similar size

---

and shape). Once the owner has filled at least one tube, she can command the saddle each round to produce any stored items she wishes.

This item takes up space on a griffon's body as a cloak, cape, or mantle.

Moderate conjuration; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, Leomund's secret cheit; Price 1,860 gp; Weight 40 lb .

Laeral's Anklets: Fashioned and worn by Laeral Arunsun, these everbright ${ }^{\text {thes }}$ anklets are adorned with tiny padlocks. Their appearance has led to rumors that Laeral is Khelben's captive, kept obedient by magic cast on the anklets. This is a rumor Laeral has never denied, as it has led to some interesting offers over the years from foes of Khelben who were hoping to gain her help in defeating him in return for freeing her.

In truth, Laeral's anklets surround the wearer with an invisible but tangible field of force, granting her a +8 armor bonus to AC. Both anklets must be worn for the magic to be effective. In addition, two times per day, the wearer can cast passwall. Finally, the everbright property means that the anklets never tarnish, are immune to acid and rusting attacks, and grant the bearer resistance to acid $\boldsymbol{f}$.

This item takes up space on the body as a pair of boots.  
Moderate transmutation; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, mage armor, 16th level caster; Price 137,000 gp; Weight -.

Laeral's Robes: Fashioned and worn by Laeral Arunsun, these rich robes are adorned with scores of magical, eyelike patterns, visible only when the robes are worn.

Laeral's robes act as a robe of eyes, a cloak of resistance $+r$, and a Heward's handy haversack.

Moderate divination; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, Leomund's secret chëst, true seeing, resistance, creator must be 15th level; Price 160,500 gp; Weight 1 lb .

Lords' Amulet: Equivalent to an amulet of proof against detection and location, these light, gold medallions on silver chains are stamped with the symbol of the particular Lord of Waterdeep's deity (so as to appear to be a simple religious symbol). They also function as keys for a set of portals in and about Waterdeep created by Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun.

Moderate abjuration; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, nondetection; Price 35,000 gp; Weight -.

Lords' Helm: These enchanted helms are worn by the Lords of Waterdeep only when they appear in public and support their featureless masks. A Lords' helm is equivalent to a ring of mind shielding, with the additional property that it alters the wearer's voice to a deep, hollow baritone.

Faint abjuration; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, ghost sound, nondetection; Price 8,750 gp; Weight -.

Lords' Rings: A Lords' ring acts as a periapt of proof against poison. It allows the wearer to cast sending (to Piergeiron or Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun only) or teleport (to a fixed location only) at will. In the latter case, the fixed location varies for each Lord, but it is always considered "very familiar."

Moderate conjuration and evocation; CL 9th; Forge Ring, neutralize poison, sending, teleport; Price 92,250 gp; Weight -.

Lords' Robe: The black robes of the Lords disguise body shape and height within their folds, making all the Lords seem 6 feet tall and of indeterminate gender. Only a true seeing effect pierces the effect, but even then the voluminous robes function as a mundane disguise that conceal most details about the wearer.

Faint illusion; CL 1st; Craft Wondrous Item, disguise self; Price 3,000 gp; Weight 1 lb .

Mask of Lhestyn: The mask of Lhestyn is a bejoweled white silk veil worn across the brow and secured by a string of black pearls. It acts as both a bat of disguise and a medallion of thoughts.

Fabricated by Shilarn Silmaeril for her daughter, Lhestyn employed the mask to infiltrate the Shadow Thieves and expose their activities. Ever since, the mask of Lhestyn has served as a symbol of Waterdeep's expulsion of the guild, making it both a beloved symbol of justice for ordinary Waterdhavians and the focus of the Shadow Thieves' anger. The mask vanished when Lhestyn's husband Zelphar died, suggesting the Shadow Thieves had a part in his murder. However, members of the exiled guild have continued to search for the mask of Lhestyn, a fact that either absolves them of his death or suggests that their plot went awry.

Faint divination; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, detect thoughts, disguise self; Price 14,700 gp; Weight -.

Spell-Lens: Originally fashioned by the Netherese, spell-lenses have only recently been recovered from the ruins of the Sargauth Enclave by explorers of Undermountain. A spell-lens resembles a small crystal oval with a socket on one end that attaches to the end of a wand. When used in such a fashion, a spell cast from a wand acts as if affected by both the Empower Spell feat and the Enlarge Spell feat, but costs triple the normal number of charges. If the wand lacks sufficient charges, the spell-lens has no effect.

Strong transmutation; CL 17th; Craft Wondrous Item, Empower Spell, Enlarge Spell; Price 13,500 gp; Weight -.

Slippers of Shadowwalking: When worn, a pair of these soft black slippers enable the wearer to use shadow walk once

## Lords' Apparel

No one in Waterdeep will knowingly traffic in the various items of Lords' apparel. None are for sale, and should a player character acquire an item of Lords' apparel and try to sell it in Waterdeep, few would consider buying it, expecting that Khelben Blackstaff would deal harshly indeed with  
anyone engaged in such trade. (Of course, folk in other cities might eagerly purchase items of a Lord's apparel.) The prices are given here so that item-crafting characters who wish to create items with similar properties (or to create fake Lords' apparel, for that matter) can do so.

per day. Originally fashioned by Marune (see page 68), the method of creating these Shadow Weave items has been shared with several other magic item fabricators in the employ of the Shadow Thieves of Amn.

Moderate illusion; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, shadow walk; Price 23,760 gp; Weight $1 / 2 \mathrm{lb}$.

Stamp of the Messenger: Appearing as a well-crafted wax-seal stamp, the silver form of this handheld seal magically produces its own sealing wax. The gold form of this stamp causes the sealed wax to animate as a Fine construct with wings and fly to the intended recipient, assuming they are within two miles of the sealed wax at the time of its creation and assuming it is affixed to an object of $1 / 2$ pound or less in weight.

Flying Wax Seal: CR 1/5; Fine construct; HD 1/8d10; hp 1; Init +0 ; Spd fly 40 ft . (average); AC 18, touch 18, flat-footed 18; Base Atk +0 (no effective attack form); SQ_darkvision 60 ft ., low-light vision, construct traits; SV Fort +0 , Ref +0 , Will +0 ; AL N; Str 1, Dex 10, Con -, Int -, Wis 10, Cha 1.

Gold: Faint transmutation; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, animate object, arcane mark, overland flight; Price 2,750 gp; Weight 1 lb .

Teukir Badge: These raw mithral badges bear the mark of a rolled-up scroll sealed by a round moon, set in white enamel rimmed with a circle of twelve blue-white stars. Once per day, the bearer of the badge can transport himself and only himself directly to the Silver Safehold, a mysterious demiplane created by Khelben and the Sword Heralds. 'Portals in the Silver Safehold lead back to Faerûn.

Strong conjuration; CL 18th; Craft Wondrous Item, plane shift; Price 12,000 gp; Weight -.

### Minorartifacts

Many magic devices of inexplicable nature and great power have been recovered from the Undermountain by generations of adventurers. Some of the more notable are described here.

Horned Ring: Fashioned by Halaster, these iron rings have pairs of tiny curved horns curling out and back toward the wearer. Only eight horned rings are known to exist, and nearly all are accounted for among Halaster's ex-apprentices. Jhesiyra Kestellharp had one in her possession, but it vanished centuries ago along with the former Magister.

At will, the wearer of a borned ring can employ greater teleport within the confines of Undermountain, unaffected by the effects of a Halaster's teleport cage. It is not possible to teleport out of or into Undermountain using a borned ring.

Upon command, the wearer of a borned ring can cloak himself in an antimagic aura ${ }^{\text {lthig. }}$.

A borned ring provides its wearer immunity to magic missiles and also functions as a major ring of energy resistance (electricity).

Strong abjuration and conjuration; CL 18th; Weight -.  
Master Ring of the Scaladar: Fashioned and worn by Trobriand the Metal Mage, this plain iron ring is capable of commanding any scaladar created by Trobriand or someone instructed in his method of constructing scaladars. If conflicting commands are issued, a master ring of the scaladar always prevails over a ring of Trobriand.

Strong evocation; CL 17th; Weight -.  
Rod of Lathander: This 2-foot-long tapered rod is fashioned of gold-plated mithral. One end of the rod flattens and widens into a half-disc with a serrated edge. Embedded in the "sunrise" tip are four rubies, four rose-hued diamonds, and four fiery-yellow corundums. Removing any of the jewels causes the gems to crumble into dust and renders the rod inoperable until the gem is replaced with a similar stone of at least 5,000 gp value.  
The rod of Lathander was fashioned at the Spires of the Morning in the Year of Lathander's Light (1024 DR), nearly eight decades before that temple was brought within the walls of Waterdeep. The paladin Dahaerlin of the Burning Brand commissioned the rod after the outlying village of Hespheira, situated in the shadow of Mount Sar, was shifted into the Plane of Shadow by unknown magic. Dahaerlin and the Brotherhood of Light spent four months in the Plane of Shadow before the company returned with over half of the missing villagers. Members of the company told a wild tale of battling a powerful shadow dracolich named Umbralax that dwelt in one of that plane's mysterious Darklands. Dahaerlin apparently won the group's escape at the cost of his own life, for he never returned.

For over a century, the rod of Lathander occupied a place of honor above the altar of the Morninglord at the Spires of the Morning. Then, in the Year of the Shadowkin Return (1136 DR), the relic's unique powers were required again. Reports trickled back to Waterdeep suggesting that the ruined village of Hespheira had returned wrapped in a cloying cloud of blackness, and that shadowy wraithlike creatures were attacking the surrounding region. In response, knights of the Order of the Aster sallied forth to combat this new menace, bathed in the protective light of the rod of Lathander. A series of quick battlefield successes drew the company deep into the shadowed village, where Umbralax lay in wait. After a fierce battle in which over half of the knights lost their lives, Umbralax and the wraiths were destroyed (although the dracolich's phylactery was never found) thanks to the protective magic of the rod.

Returned to its place of honor, the rod of Lathander remained above the altar of the Spire of the Morning until the Night of Temple Fires, in the Year of the Saddle (1345 DR). Thieves stole the rod and several other Lathanderite relics as Waterdeep's oldest temple burned, prompting some to conclude that the fires had been deliberately set as a distraction. Although no word of the rod's fate has ever come to light in the years since its theft, reports persist of a subterranean sun in the depths of Undermountain, shining from the roof of a large natural cavern. Such reports have prompted many followers of the Morninglord to plumb the depths of Halaster's Halls, but without success.

---

The rod of Lathander glows with the power of a 9 th-level heightened daylight spell from the minute the sun rises to the minute the sun sets. If taken to a location where the sun does not shine (indoors, underground, or on a sunless plane), the rod adheres to the diurnal cycle of the last place it was in where the sun regularly rose and set. If taken to another location where a different sun shines (another plane or world, for example), the rod automatically adjusts to the new diurnal cycle, including adjustments for changes in latitude and longitude.

The rod of Lathander has one additional power. For as long as the rod shines, all creatures within the 60 -foot radius of the daylight spell are protected by a death sward effect.

Strong evocation; CL 17th; Weight 5 lb .

### DOISON

As with any large city, Waterdeep's populace makes periodic use of poisons against their enemies. Such means of warfare are particularly common among merchants and nobles.

Sleep-Smoke: Used primarily by agents of the Xanathar Thieves' Guild for kidnapping; sleep-smoke is a dark-gray, smoky gas that rapidly dissipates when released into the air. One dose affects a globe 10 feet in diameter on the first round, expanding outward to a globe 20 feet in diameter on the second round, and being harmless thereafter. A strong wind can move the globe of sleep-smoke.

Type: Inhaled DC 15; Initial damage unconsciousness for 1 minute; Secondary damage unconsciousness for $1 \mathrm{~d} \overline{3}$ minutes; Price 25 gp ; DC to create 15 ; CR modifier +1 .

### Spells

Many spells in use today across the Realms were once exclusively associated with the spellcasters of Waterdeep. Examples include battering ram, blackstaff, Dublark's glasstrike, healing touch, Kbelben's suspended silence, and Laeral's cutting band. (See Magic of Faerûn for details of these spells.) The following spells, presented in alphabetical order, are still exclusively (or nearly so) associated with the City of Splendors.

### Binding Chain of Fate

Evocation  
Level: Sorcerer/wizard 9  
Components: V, S, M  
Casting Time: 1 action  
Range: Close ( $25 \mathrm{ft} .+5 \mathrm{ft} . / 2$ levels)  
Effect: Whirling chain of force  
Duration: 1 round/level  
Saving Throw: Will negates  
Spell Resistance: Yes  
You create a chain of force that whirls into a loop around a single creature of your choice, making a metallic rattling sound as it does so. The chain creates an oscillating ring surrounding the target at a distance of 5 feet (so all squares adjacent to the target creature are within the chain). If the creature succeeds  
on its saving throw, the chain fails to encircle it and dissipates harmlessly. Otherwise, the chain surrounds the target, with the following effects:

The target creature cannot leave the area defined by the chain. Other creatures can enter or leave the area (although they must succeed on a DC 15 Escape Artist check or a DC 15 Tumble check to slip past the chain). If the target was in midair (flying, levitating, and so on) when the chain took effect, the chain suspends the target in midair safely as if it had a solid floor on which to stand.

The chain prevents the target from changing form, including lycanthropic form changes, vampiric transformations, or polymorph or similar effects.

The chain acts as a dimensional anchor upon the target.  
The chain deals 2 d 6 points of force damage per round to the target.

No magic functions within the chain, as if the chain defined the area of an antimagic field. This means that the target cannot use any magic, and no magic from outside the chain affects the creature.

The chain cannot be dispelled, but it is automatically destroyed by disintegrate, Mordenkainen's disjunction, or a rod of cancellation.

Material Component: A tiny silver chain.

### EnSUL'S SOULTHEFT

Necromancy [Evil]  
Level: Sorcerer/wizard 9  
Components: V, S, M  
Casting Time: 1 full round  
Range: Touch  
Target: Living, corporeal creature touched  
Duration: 1 round/level (D); see text  
Saving Throw: Will negates  
Spell Resistance: Yes  
Crackling black radiance surrounds your left hand. While the spell lasts, you can make touch attacks to steal the lifeforce of another creature in a manner that heals and renews you, diluting diseases and poisons, and prolonging your life span.

With a successful melee touch attack, you drain 1d4 points of Intelligence from the victim touched. This is permanent ability drain. For every point of Intelligence drained, you heal 5 points of damage. Healing in excess of your normal maximum is retained as temporary hit points that fade after 1 hour. In addition, you receive an immediate Fortitude save against any diseases or poisons currently ravaging your body when you drain a foe's Intellligence, as long as the disease or poison in question allowed a Fortitude save in the first place. The DC for this saving throw is the same as the DC of the original effect that poisoned or infected you, and there is no penalty if you fail this new saving throw.

If a victim is reduced to 0 Intelligence as a result of this spell, it dies. A victim slain in this manner is forever dead and cannot be brought back by raise dead, resurrection, or similar magic unless used in conjunction with a miracle or wish. When

---

you slay a victim in this manner, you do not age for a number of days equal to the number of points of Intelligence drained. If the victim was a spellcaster, the gain in lifespan is increased by the sum of the spell levels prepared by or available to the victim at the time of death. If the victim was a pson, the gain in lifespan is increased by a number of days equal to the victim's power point reserve.

Ensul's soultheft lasts for 1 round per level, during which time you can attempt touch attacks as often as once per round. Some users of this spell arrange for the victim to be restrained or otherwise helpless, so that they can be easily drained for multiple rounds.

Material Component: A drop of blood taken from a vampire.

### Halaster's BlackSPHERE

Evocation [Force]  
Level: Sorcerer/wizard 8  
Components: V, S, M  
Casting Time: 1 action  
Range: Medium ( $100 \mathrm{ft} .+10 \mathrm{ft} . / \mathrm{level}$ )  
Area: $10-\mathrm{ft}$-radius burst and globe  
Duration: $2 \mathrm{~d} 4$ rounds +1 round/level  
Saving Throw: Reflex half; see text  
Spell Resistance: Yes  
This spell creates a burst of black force. The force burst causes 1 d 6 points of force damage per caster level (maximum 20 d 6 ) and envelops the affected area in a sphere of force with a radius of 10 feet, trapping creatures within. A successful Reflex save reduces the damage by half and negates the entrapment effect. Creatures trapped inside cannot escape except by those methods that can bypass or destroy a wall of force.

This spell can be used in lieu of wall of force as part of creating a bead of force.

Material Components: A small piece of charcoal and a small piece of onyx.

### Halaster's Fetch I

Conjuration (Calling)  
Level: Sorcerer/wizard 4  
As summon monster I, except called creatures do not disappear at the end of the spell's duration. They do, however, become free-willed and outside the control of the caller after the spell expires.

### Halaster's Fetch II

Conjuration (Calling)  
Level: Sorcerer/wizard 7  
As summon monster II, except called creatures do not disappear at the end of the spell's duration. However, they become free-willed and outside the control of the caller after the spell expires.

### Halaster's Fetch III

Conjuration (Calling)  
Level: Sorcerer/wizard 6  
As summon monster III, except called creatures do not disappear at the end of the spell's duration. However, they become free-willed and outside the control of the caller after the spell expires.

### Halaster's Fetch IV

Conjuration (Calling)  
Level: Sorcerer/wizard 7  
As summon monster IV, except called creatures do not disappear at the end of the spell's duration. However, they become free-willed and outside the control of the caller after the spell expires.

### Halaster's Fetch V

Conjuration (Calling)  
Level: Sorcerer/wizard 8  
As summon monster $V$, except called creatures do not disappear at the end of the spell's duration. However, they become free-willed and outside the control of the caller after the spell expires.

Ensul's soultheft

---

### Halaster's Fetch VI

Conjuration (Calling)  
Level: Sorcerer/wizard 9  
As summon monster VI, except called creatures do not disappear at the end of the spell's duration. However, they become free-willed and outside the control of the caller after the spell expires.

### Halaster's Image Swap

Conjuration (Teleportation)  
Level: Bard 4, sorcerer/wizard 4  
Components: V  
Casting Time: 1 action  
Range: Medium ( $100 \mathrm{ft} .+10 \mathrm{ft}$. /level)  
Target: You and touched objects weighing up to $50 \mathrm{lb} . / \mathrm{level}$  
Duration: Instantaneous  
Saving Throw: None and Will negates (object)  
Spell Resistance: No and Yes (object)  
You instantly swap locations with a projected image. You always arrive exactly where your image previously stood, and you leave a projected image in your wake. To anyone incapable of discerning that the projected image is an illusion, the image swap occurs without visible clue. To anyone capable of discerning that the projected image is an illusion, the image swap is effectively identical to a dimension door.

This spell has no effect if you do not have a projected image in effect. Unlike normal teleport spells, use of Halaster's image swap does not count as breaking one's line of sight with a projected image.

Material Component: A small replica of you (a doll).

### Halaster's Light Step

Transmutation  
Level: Bard 2, sorcerer/wizard 2  
As fly, except Halaster's light step provides a maximum speed of 30 feet ( 20 feet if the subject wears medium or heavy armor). Additionally, the subject cannot ascend or descend vertically unless hovering 1 foot or less above terrain that ascends or descends at an angle of less than 45 degrees.

The practical impact of this spell is to allow the recipient to walk along reasonably level terrain without leaving tracks and to stride across chasms at will. It also adds a +15 circumstance bonus on Climb checks, a +10 circumstance bonus on Move Silently checks (which does not stack with the bonus provided by boots of elvenkind), and negates any chance of falling. When this spell is used in combination with levitate, the combined effect is equivalent to a slow-speed $f y$ spell. It provides no additional benefit if used in combination with $f y$.

### Halaster's Shaking Hand

Evocation  
Level: Sorcerer/wizard 6  
As Bigby's interposing band, except the hand can also grapple the magic hand created by the following spells: Bigby's clenched fist, Bigby's crushing band, Bigby's forceful band, and Bigby's grasping hand. The shaking hand gets one grapple attack per round. Its grapple bonus against another magic hand is your level + your Intelligence or Charisma modifier (for wizards or sorcerers, respectively), +9 for the hand's Strength score (29), +4 for being Large.

Once grappled, a magic hand can only escape the shaking hand by making an opposed grapple check, unless the duration of the grappled hand exceeds the duration of the shaking band. In cases where no Strength score is given, assume the magic hand has a Strength score of $17+$ twice the level of the spell. Once a grapple is broken, nothing prevents your shaking band from attempting another grapple attack.

For example, a wizard uses Halaster's shaking band to grapple a sorcerer's Bigby's forceful band, rolls a 10 on a d20, adds +4 for his own Intelligence score (18), adds +9 for the hand's Strength score (29), and adds +4 for the hand's size (Large), for a total of 27 . The sorcerer seeks to break the handshake; he rolls a 14 on a d20, adds +4 for his own Charisma score (18), adds +8 for the hand's Strength score (27), and adds +4 for the hand's size (Large) for a total of 30. The "handshake" (grapple) lasts for at least 1 more round. If, however, the sorcerer had rolled a 15 or higher, the handshake would have been broken, at least until the shaking band successfully grappled the forceful band again.

## Halaster's Drifting Portals

The mad archmage of Undermountain long ago devised a number of unique properties for the portals he created in his terrible dungeon, including the odd drifting portals.

A drifting portal has its origin or terminus tied to a general area, not a specific fixed location. The creator of the portal must specify whether this spell affects the origin of a portal or the terminus of a portal during the creation of the device. Such portals drift continuously and randomly within the radius specified by the portal builder (anything from 10 to 1,000 feet from the focal point) at a rate of 10  
feet per round. To determine the random motion of a drifting portal, roll 1d6 three times per minute to determine a portal's movement; 1-2 means up, left, or forward; 3-4 means no change, no change, or no change; 5-6 means down, right, or backward).

A portal's creator can direct its path through active concentration, which requires a standard action. Once the creator ceases concentration, the portal resumes its random drift until concentration is resumed. A portal with the drifting property costs $50 \%$ more than it otherwise would.

### Halaster's Teleport Cage

Abjuration  
Level: Sorcerer/wizard 9  
Components: V, S, M  
Casting Time: 10 minutes  
Range: Close ( 25 feet +5 ft. $/ 2$ levels)  
Area: One 10 -ft. cube per level  
Duration: Permanent  
Saving Throw: None  
Spell Resistance: No  
This spell modifies the functioning of all conjuration (teleportation) spells and spell-like abilities, including dimension door, greater teleport, refuge, teleport, teleportation circle, and word of recall, into, out of, and within its area.

If cast in an area adjoining or overlapping another teleport cage, the effects of both spells merge to create a single teleport cage. Undermountain, the greatest dungeon of Faerûn, is believed to have been enclosed within the largest teleport cage in existence in the Realms by means of this effect.

When cast within a teleport cage, such translocation spells simply transport all affected creatures and objects to another random location within the teleport cage. For example, if a wizard casts teleport within the confines of Undermountain, the encompassing teleport cage would cause him to appear at another random location within the great dungeon.

When a caster outside the area encompassed by a teleport cage attempts to teleport into it, this spell redirects their destination to another random location reachable by the spell. For example, if a 9 th-level wizard in Waterdeep attempted to teleport into the depths of Undermountain, the teleport cage would cause him to appear at another random location within 900 miles of the place where he cast the spell.

Material Component: Diamond dust worth 1,000 gp.

### JHANIFER'S DELIQUESCENCE

Transmutation [Cold, Water]  
Level: Sorcerer/wizard 4  
Components: V, S  
As transmute rock to mud, except it transforms ice to cold water (about $40^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ ).

The water remains until a successful dispel magic spell or spell with the cold descriptor restores its substance-but not necessarily its form. The water will freeze again naturally depending on local weather conditions and the depth of the water, normally over the course of several hours or days.

This spell was created by Syluné in her guise as Jhanifer.

### JUMPGOUT

Evocation [Fire]  
Level: Sorcerer/wizard 5  
Components: V  
Casting Time: 1 action  
Range: Medium ( $100 \mathrm{ft} .+10 \mathrm{ft} . /$ level)  
Duration: 2 rounds

Area: 5 -ft.-radius pillar of flame, up to 30 ft . tall  
Saving Throw: Reflex half; see text  
Spell Resistance: Yes  
You create a vertical pillar of roaring flame. Creatures caught in the fire take 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level, up to a maximum of 15 d 6 . On your next turn (the second round of the spell) the pillar vanishes and reappears up to 60 feet away from its original location. If you maintain concentration on the spell on its second round (a standard action), you can choose the spot where the pillar reappears. Otherwise, the pillar moves $1 \mathrm{~d} 6 \times 10$ feet in a random direction. Creatures caught in the pillar on the second round take 1 d 6 points of fire damage per 2 caster levels (Reflex half). The pillar then dies away in a swirl of sparks.

### KHELBEN'S DWEOMERDOOM

Abjuration  
Level: Sorcerer/wizard 9  
Components: V, S, F  
Casting Time: 1 swift action  
Range: Close ( 25 ft. +5 ft./2 levels)  
Target: 1 creature  
Duration: Instantåneous  
Saving Throw: None  
Spell Resistance: No  
You counterspell an opponent's spell or spell-like ability before it is even cast and without knowing what spell you are countering.

If the target prepares spells, you counterspell the highest level spell currently prepared, eliminating it from the target's list of prepared spells for that day. If the target casts spells spontaneously (and does not prepare spells), you effectively reduce by one the number of spells per day of the highest level spell slot available. If the target has spell-like abilities (and does not prepare spells or cast spells spontaneously), it loses one use of the highest-level spell-like ability available. Otherwise, this spell has no effect.

You must make a successful dispel check (as the spell dispel magic, but the maximum caster level on your dispel check is +25 instead of +10 ) to successfully counter or remove your opponent's prepared spell, spell slot, or use of a spell-like ability.

Focus: A crystal lens worth at least 1,000 gp.

### Laerals's Crowning Touch

Necromancy  
Level: Cleric 9, sorcerer/wizard 9  
Components: V, S, F, XP  
Casting Time: 1 standard action  
Range: Touch  
Target: One spellcaster  
Duration: 1 year and 1 day  
Saving Throw: Will negates; see text  
Spell Resistance: Yes

---

You place a curse on the subject. Mystra's symbol appears drawn in silver on each palm (or on the chest and forehead of beings lacking palms) as a glowing brand equal that sheds light as a candle. A creature that can cast arcane spells, such as a sorcerer or wizard, takes a -4 penalty on its saving throw.

Any time the target casts a spell, he gains a number of negative levels equal to the level of the spell being cast. (The spell he just cast functions normally at the caster level he possessed before he received the negative levels for casting that spell.) This effect is cumulative and lasts as long as the crowning touch lasts. There is no saving throw to avoid gaining the negative levels, but 24 hours after gaining each negative level, the subject must make a Fortitude saving throw ( $\mathrm{DC}=$ crowning touch's spell save) for each negative level. If the save succeeds, that negative level is removed.

With each spell use, streaks of silver appear in the hair of the target, until the transgressor's hair is all silver (which happens when the character's level reaches 1st).

The curse bestowed by this spell cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a wish spell or a successful break enchantment spell (caster level check DC $15+$ caster level of the crowning touch). After the curse is lifted, all the effects (except permanent level loss) go away.

This spell was developed for use only against beings who misuse the sort of magic Mystra has dominion over. The Lady of Mysteries does not look kindly on mages who hurl deadly magic at every spellcaster who insults them. Mystra has been known to shorten the effects on the truly repentant and the undeserving, if they pray to her for forgiveness and obtain an atonement spell.

Focus: A prism worth at least $1,000 \mathrm{gp}$.  
$X P$ Cost: $1,000 \mathrm{XP}$ (reduced to 500 XP if cast by a character with Mystra's special blessing, such as one of the Chosen of Mystra or the Magister).

### LaFral's Silver Lance

Evocation [Force]  
Level: Sorcerer/wizard 3  
Components: V, S, F  
Casting Time: 1 standard action  
Range: Long ( $400 \mathrm{ft} .+40 \mathrm{ft}$. /level)  
Duration: Instantaneous  
Saving Throw: Fortitude partial; see text  
Spell Resistance: Yes  
This spell brings into being a shimmering, silver lancelike column of force, equivalent to a Large lance. The lance flies toward a single creature you  
pantomime throwing it at when you cast the spell. Its attack bonus is equal to your caster level + your Intelligence bonus or your Charisma bonus (for wizards or sorcerers, respectively) with an additional +3 enhancement bonus and a +2 bonus for charging. It deals $4 \mathrm{~d} 6+3$ points of force damage, with a threat range of 20 and a critical multiplier of $\times 3$. In addition, the creature struck must succeed on a Fortitude save or be knocked prone by the impact.

Focus: A miniature platinum lance engraved with arcane runes that costs 250 gp to construct.

### PalarandusK's Fire Breath

Evocation [Fire]  
Level: Sorcerer/wizard 2  
Components: V, S  
Casting Time: 1 standard action  
Area: $10-\mathrm{ft}$. cone  
Duration: One hour or until discharged  
Saving Throw: Reflex half

Larral's silver lance

---

Palarandusk's fire breath is considered a breath weapon. If you expend the spell on the round you cast it, you only use one standard action to cast and breathe. If you save the spell for later, you must use a standard action to breathe fire. If unused, the gout of flame dissipates after 1 hour. One nasty side effect of this spell is terrible heartburn.

### StEELSTING

Evocation [Force]  
Level: Sorcerer/wizard 4  
Components: V  
Casting Time: 1 standard action  
Range: Medium ( $100 \mathrm{ft} .+10 \mathrm{ft}$. /level)  
Area: 5 -ft.-radius cylinder, 25 ft . tall  
Duration: Instantaneous  
Saving Throw: None  
Spell Resistance: Yes  
You create a brief maelstrom of flying darts of force that spin, slice, and rebound within the area. Each creature within the area is targeted by $1 \mathrm{~d} \overline{3}+1$ melee attacks from these darts (check for each creature separately). The darts strike with an attack bonus equal to your caster level + your Intelligence or Charisma bonus (for wizards or sorcerers, respectively), dealing 2 d 6 points of damage per hit.

The name is a misnomer, for the spell creates neither steel nor a true sting.

### Trobriand's Baleful Teleport

Conjuration (Teleportation)  
Level: Sorcerer/wizard 6  
Range: Close ( $25 \mathrm{ft} .+5 \mathrm{ft} . / 2$ levels)  
Target: One creature  
Saving Throw: Will negates  
Spell Resistance: Yes  
As teleport, except that you send the targeted creature (and only that creature) and carried objects to a designated destination.

You must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. The clearer your mental image, the more likely the teleportation works. Areas of strong physical or magical energy might make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible.

If the destination is "very familiar," the target gets no saving throw bonus. If the destination is "studied carefully," the target gets a +2 saving throw bonus. Likewise, if the destination is "seen casually," "viewed once," or "false destination," the target gets a $+4,+6$, or +8 bonus, respectively.

Saving Throw: Fortitude negates  
Spell Resistance: Yes  
This spell reduces the hardness and hit points of the targeted object to that of glass (hardness 1 and 1 hit point/inch of thickness). If the object already has a lower hardness score, the spell has no effect. (As always, if the object is attended, its owner receives a saving throw; unattended nonmagical objects do not receive saving throws.)

Material Component: A glass needle worth 100 gp .
