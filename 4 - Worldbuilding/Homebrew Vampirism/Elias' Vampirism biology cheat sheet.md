# Elias' Vampirism biology cheat sheet 

Hard sci-fi Vampire worldbuilding for urban fantasy setting. Basically, this is an attempt to create a biologically "realistic" species that makes sense in "our world", but can be applied to any setting or historical time period.

In this cheat sheet we assume a non-magical world, but magical abilities can be added if so desired!

Content warning for mentions and some depictions of sexual themes, blood, death, discrimination, gender dysphoria, and thematically typical levels of gore and violence. Free to use this template for your RPG and DnD needs.

## Vampire biology and sociology

Vampires are a species that lives a parasitic lifestyle with their host species. They feed off of blood from other lifeforms - not killing them. They can life off of blood from any large mammal without causing long-lasting damage to their victim's body, but have preferences both informed by personal preference and cultural background. Cows, horses, pigs, some types of deer, hogs and elk are commonly used for their large blood volume, but sometimes, wolves or even bears are on the menu.

A vampire reaches procreative maturity at around two hundred years of life. They need to create a lot of offspring since the mortality rate in the first decades is extremely high (think frog or fish eggs, only two out of a thousand make it). Raising their young and taking care of them is as much part of vampiric life as it is of humans'.

## Spawnhood/Infancy and colony life

A vampire`s life cycle begins with their host body falling into stasis, and their physical appearance freezes permanently. During their first days as vampires they appear as if dead. In reality, this stage is similar to what plenty of other species go through - cocooning.

---

# Stage I Diagnostic Markers (Cocooning Phase) 

## 1. Sudden Onset of Stasis

- Complete Immobility: no detectable heartbeat or respiration via conventional means.
- Body temperature drops to ambient.
- Pupils fixed and unresponsive to light.


## 2. Dermal Excretion

- A thin, chemical coating appears across the host's skin within 12-24 hours.
- Composition is acidic, highly toxic to scavengers and microorganisms. Do not handle the patient without proper safety gear.
- Functions
- Defensive cocoon to ward off predators.
- Natural protection from infections
- Removes sun damaged skin


## 3. Skin Transformation Indicators

- Epidermis becomes unnaturally pale or ghost-white.
- More pronounced in individuals with a tan
- Shedding begins approximately $48-72$ hours post-transition.
- Tiry, baking patches resembling reptilian molting.
- In some cases, a full facial "mask" of old skin may detach in a single piece.
- Note: This phenomenon is believed to have inspired early folklore about vampires "wearing human skin".


## 4. Alteration of Identifying Features

- Tattoos, scars, and other dermal markings fade or disappear entirely.
- Wrinkles smooth out as damaged surface layers are shed

Staff is advised to behave professionally at all times around a patient in stasis - they might appear dead, but we know that most vampires retain some awareness and might hear you. If patient wakes up during the process, sedation is advised due to a high risk of the patient hurting themselves while in a confused state.

Diagnostic manual for hospital staff, 2014

To avoid any scavenging or predation during this stage, they emit chemicals that coat the outer layer of their skin. This toxic ooze also acts as a strong organic bleaching agent, making their skin look younger and, in some cases, ghostly white (depending on the complexion). It will also kill the sun-damaged surface layer of the skin and make it shed, revealing smooth texture underneath.

Medical application of Vampiric phenol is popular for aesthetic dermatology. It usually requires dilution and some other tweaks to be safe for humans. Nowadays, it is entirely synthetically made, but there used to be rather unethical means to aquire the ingredients. In the 19th century, physicians would force vampires to get severely sunburned so they could harvest the serum from their skin in exchange for not outing them to the public.

Upon waking up from stasis, a newborn's human canines fall out and make room for a doublespiked pair of fangs. This change is described by patients as an rather unpleasant process, and many experience feelings of shame and anxiety about the prominent empty spots in their mouth. Even though their new fangs grow in rather quickly, this process might take up to three to four days to complete.

Another early onset change is their tongues, which grow longer and change their surface texture as to take in blood more efficiently. They can grow as large as ten centimeters and are usually purple in color. Small ridges and canals under the surface of the tongue make sure not a drop is

Their digestive system shifts to support a diet consisting of blood and raw meat.
It is still a medical mystery how a vampire's circulation works. Current research assumes that the tubes that transport the blood have a strong muscular tension that is capable of moving it through the body without a heartbeat. Since the body temperature of a vampire is usually quite low, their circulation is slow and extremely hard to detect even by doctors. It was only confirmed in the last decades that vampires in fact possess a circulatory system.

A condition that exists in humans, "Hemoglobin M disease", is extremely common in vampires. It results in a dark brown blood color and discoloration of the skin and the tissues inside the mouth, which appear purple (cyanosis). Darker skin will have a purple hue in the areas of the lips and under finger nails.

# Health and Disease management 

Due to their long lifespans, vampires would be at high risk of developing cancer and other serious health complications. This is why their bodies have developed well-tuned preventions. Like e.g. naked mole rats, vampires are immune to cancer and many other deadly diseases and

---

infections. They can usually survive amputations and can regenerate and recover from almost anything if they are in stasis. Vampiric bodies can re-build most organs and limbs within a few months or years. However, if someone interrupts this process by waking them up, vampires are at right risk of death or at least serious complications. Vampires will instinctively and fiercely protect members of their colony that are in stasis and attack any intruders that dare enter their sick wards.

When deprived of oxygen, vampires can survive and operate easily for about 20-30 minutes before any damage to their brain can occur. In stasis, they can stay in low oxygen environments indefinitely.
Scientific theories suggest that these traits might have developed because the predecessors of vampires used to be a tunnel- or cave-dwelling species that dealt with frequent flooding.

Their bodies will regularly use deep chemical shedding to get rid of damaged skin, which also helps them keep looking youthful - an important part of their reproduction, as they need to appear healthy and attractive to human sexual partners at over two hundred years of age.

Vampires are ectothermic and will seek out warmth instinctively. This may seem counterintuitive to their nocturnal lifestyle, but the working theory is that their genetic origins are from a climate that has extremely hot and humid weather with warm nights that rarely ever drop below 20 degrees celsius, making this lifestyle a favorable adaption in tropical climate. Unfortunately, due to the spread of vampirism into other regions of the world, many vampires in those climate zones suffer from hypothermia as their bodies struggle to adapt to cold weather. Much like humans, who have no fur to protect against the cold, vampires need to get a little creative to solve this issue. If alone, sleeping in small spaces that traps warmth is a popular choice ("box beds" were also used by humans in cold climates). This gave rise to the popular misconception of vampires sleeping in coffins.

In groups, hive members will huddle together and preserve heat with close body contact. Some people who dared enter spawnground territory have described walking into a seemingly empty dark room just to be greeted with the reflective eyeballs of around a hundred vampires who shared a bedroom.

# Feeding 

In their first years of spawnhood, newborns feed from older vampires. This form of nursing helps newborns get used to the process and also functions as a bonding activity. Even adolescents and adult vampires use mutual feeding as a way to ease stress and relieve tensions between group members. It can also have health benefits and can greatly speed up recovery from injuries and disease. If a vampire takes care of newborn, their blood volume will increase and have a higher nutritional value, as newborns will not have fully developed the enzymes that are needed for a fully blood- and raw meat based diet. Newborns will sometimes consume some dairy products to supplement their diet, and need some time until they can sustain themselves on blood and raw meat entirely. In one studies from 2018, newborn claimed that they "occasionally consume processed meat, grilled or cooked meat, milk, yogurt or cheese" and several

---

anonymous reports claim that in desperation , "tried to catch a small animal, like a rat or pigeon" when they felt hungry while they had no access to fresh blood.

A caretaker's wound healing speed is insanely fast, mitigating the effects from newborn biting them several times per week. While it does leave scars, a newborn's bite is something an older vampire's body was made to handle. Caution is advised for humans trying to let a newborn feed on them and should be discussed with a physician.

Since adult vampires have sedative venom, letting them feed is a sign of trust and intimacy. Their bites are also much more painful, as their teeth are designed for ripping through the skin of e.g. a cow, not a humans. Some humans do seek out this thrill voluntarily, but doctors have to advise strongly against this practice. (A Small Safety Guide To Vampire Bites, Dr. Millers et al, 2016).

Newborn physiology is primed for feeding from colony members - even their vampiric "baby teeth" are shaped differently than an adults' to lessen painful sensations. Their saliva contains pain relieving substances, has anti-inflammatory properties and dramatically raises oxytocin levels in the person who provides them with blood, making this a safe and very pleasant experience for all involved parties. It is said by some that a young vampire's saliva can cure melancholy. Due to the often prevalent social stigma around letting a vampire feed from them, humans might claim to have been "bewitched" by a newborn vampire to explain their transgressions to the community.

# Teething and fangs 

Feeding from animals is much more difficult and most newborn are slowly introduced to it by their older siblings within their first decade of living as vampires. However, most colonies will practice mutual feeding even after that point to deepen the bonds between members of the group, and it is common to use it as foreplay between sexual partners, to establish partnerships, or for religious purposes.

As they get older, their physiology changes and their fangs are replaced and grow longer, reaching their adult form at around $14-20 \mathrm{~mm}$.

Between those stages in their development, a vampire will lose all their human teeth. Some will keep their them as charms and display them proudly as jewelry or decoration on their clothing as a sign of growing older (as they do not age physically). By the time they are around 90-100 years old, all of their human teeth are replaced by their vampiric counterparts. This is when a vampire is officially considered as an "adolescent" in most medical settings.

In adolescence they will also develop another set of thin, long fangs set in their lower jaw that hide under their gums - these are long, hollow structures that contain a nerve paralyzing fluid. After a successful bite, these fangs slide out of their pockets and administer a large dose to their prey that goes directly into the blood stream tranquilizing the victim. Cows and horses generally experience around an hour of immobility. Humans might need several hours to recover. The mental effects can range from pleasant stupor to "quietly horrifying". A synthetic version of the venom is used in veterinarian surgery, and has recently gained popularity as a recreational drug.

This adaption is what gives vampires an edge in a lot of conflicts and makes them very effective hunters.

# Sleep and stasis 

Just as their first days as vampires are spent in a comatose stasis, this sort of hibernation becomes their strongest survival mechanism. Not only do they enter this state during their cocooning phases, but also to recuperate and hibernate.
A vampire can handle icing cold, starvation, and physical injuries like this. Stasis can last days, weeks, months and in some cases even decades. In colder climates vampires will use this to survive the winter periods. To avoid predators, they will lock themselves into fortresses, cellars and underground shelters for this period. Older vampires often maintain stasis for several years at a time to save energy.
Stasis is, while a tremendous feat of biology, a harrowing process and only happens if a vampire is badly wounded or diseased. Hence, vampires might live many decades with missing limbs, scars, deformities or body modification. They can be in wheelchairs, rely on medication, and have chronic pain. They can also still get plastic surgery, piercings and tattoos just like any human.

They typically sleep during the day and prefer low-light, warm conditions. Vampires will also be very drawn to humans due to their comparatively extremely warm bodies, often using their intimate contacts with them as an occasion to sleep in a pre-heated bed. While most vampires have little desire to draw blood from humans if they are well-fed, they definitely seek out close body contact for this reason.

---

# Discrimination and support systems 

If a spawn is not found or abandoned in the first few days after their transformation into a vampire, chances of survival are almost zero, since they depend on a local support system to feed them. This will usually be a local hive (vampire colony) but could also technically be supportive humans. This makes newborns the most vulnerable group in the hive and there are older vampires whose task is to track down newly turned spawn and bring them to a safe location. Some have compared the sometimes rather blunt and detached demeanor of an experienced vampire in this situation as similar to an emergency room nurse or a firefighter. In dire cases, vampires might climb through windows or picklock a door to find a distressed newborn - one of the few times they will enter another person's house without explicit consent.

If newborns end up in the hospital - which used to be the exception, but is now the majority of cases - the situation might become more complicated. Newborns can be taken care of with the means of modern medicine, such as daily blood transfusions and supplemental solutions, but it is certainly not ideal. Newborn vampires might experience severe discrimination in hospital settings both by other patients and untrained staff. Some countries will also diagnose and register any newborn vampires upon arrival in hospitals due to alleged safety concerns, making this a very unpopular option. Newborn will, even today, usually end up looking for other vampires to take care of them rather than relying on modern medicine. This is especially true when there is no universal healthcare.

Due to this early dependency and the simultaneous discrimination by human society, newborn vampires quickly assimilate into their new role as spawn and often disengage from their previous social circle after they are taken in by an older vampire. Sometimes, in smaller colonies, this older caretaker will be their only chance at life and their only opportunity for close and safe social interaction for several years.

A lot of humans will regard a newly turned vampire as "dead", and in modern times, a lot of governments still actually regard them as legally deceased, stripping them off of their human rights.

This severe isolation and segregation creates a lot of (often deadly and genocidal) tension between vampires and the dominant human society. Due to their physical differences (lack of a delectable heartbeat, body temperature, fangs.,...) they can be held up and segregated at checkpoints, by law enforcement, militias, and religious groups, making it impossible to remain undetected.

Most Vampires will have a strong bond with at least one other vampire, but there is no upper limit as to how big a family system can be. Most will have a parent-child like relationship with the

---

vampires that raised them and hives generally have a very strict and instinctive social order based on age. Even in cases where it is only humans taking care of a vampire, it will naturally fall into the role of a newborn spawn and change their behavior towards their peers accordingly. A lot of human families with newborn vampires in them describe how their biggest challenges are the vampire's intense separation anxiety and subservient behavior towards them. Newborn vampires cannot live alone and if unable to join a vampire colony, might cohabitate with their human parents or siblings. Especially in their early years, newborn will struggle with being away from their guardians for more than a few hours due to their need to be fed. While some human societies see this as perfectly fine and see no issue with this form of caretaking, some modern western countries consider this as a problem, and newborn vampires will be regarded as developmentally delayed, disabled, and unfit for work.

In worst cases, young vampires who do not have a colony (or are separated from it forcefully) end up in abusive situations, sex work, slavery, and trafficking. This is why a lot of older vampires will usually discourage newborns from feeding from random humans and do not let them travel far from their spawnground for the first few years. A spawn without any supervision and no one to feed them will eventually turn violent, but this is not their own fault - a lot has to go wrong for this to happen.

# Life cycle of a Vampire 

Vampires can lead very long, eventful lives. The following section dives into each stage of a vampire's development.

---

![img-9.jpeg](Elias'%20Vampirism%20biology%20cheat%20sheet_img-9.jpeg)
(Diagram from Myths of Immortality by Prof. Dr. Engel, Chair member of the international society of Vampiric health)

Early life

The first decade of a newborn vampire will mostly consist of trying to survive. A lot of them just spontaneously die after their transformation if they do not get fresh blood immediately. If there is no local support system, starvation is common and anticipated, and newborn vampires who have no caretakers are often considered the most dangerous due to their desperate nature. Due to frequent purges by human vampire hunter militias, there are many places with insufficient resources, creating famine-like conditions for newborn vampires. To avoid backlash from the public, older vampires will often keep younger ones in check, or even kill them if they raise too much suspicion. In some communities adult vampires cannot afford sharing the already scarce resources with spawns, so they actively eliminate competition.

In some situations young vampires are taken care of by their village and offered blood by their human family members to keep them alive. In those cases, vampirism is integrated in local customs and is seen as a rite of passage for certain positions in religious groups. Vampires might be regarded as protecters of the village and carry on oral customs and tales thanks to their longer life spans.

---

The following decades of their new life the newborns will learn how to fend for themselves and, if they don't die trying, a lot of them will even find ways to get a safe and reliable source of blood. Before the 1900s, most lived outside of big cities. Domesticated cows or sheep were a popular choice for their blood, and historically the profession of shepherd is a very safe option. Some might have been hunters, others worked on farms, or in small vampire-friendly communes (The historical dwellings of the Vampire, Prof. Yan, Researcher for Science And Culture Quarterly).

By the time they hit fifty, they would have slotted into their environmental niche and were no threat to humans at all. Typically they live undetected and simple lives surrounded by farm animals.

Unfortunately, modern conditions are far more dire. This will be discussed later in this text.

# Adolescence 

If they do not die in their first decades of life, a spawn will turn into an adolescent vampire. As they enter stasis once again, their bodies enter their second cocooning stage. Their bodies change, new teeth grow, their autonomy increases, and their role in the colony shifts from worker to caretaker and guardian. They form close bonds with other adolescent vampires and work together as a team to fulfill their duties.

They spend the next hundred years nursing new spawn, protecting their hive, and managing resources. Adolescent vampires often have to make sacrifices and difficult decisions about life and death within the colony. At this point they show very little interest in humans and have no intrinsic need to interact with them.

## Adult form

After their third and final cocooning, a vampire has now reached adulthood. This rare achievement is an exceptional milestone for a colony, and a reason for big celebrations and lavish feasts.

A vampire close to two hundred years of life will themselves now be able to survive without their hive. In their adult form, vampires are strong enough to take down large mammals by themselves. Their agility, strength and reflexes make it possible to incapacitate a fully grown horse or bull long enough to feed on them. This makes it possible to move around more and feed less often, as they now rely on hunting wild animals. They become more solitary creatures and regard other vampires as competition, and assert territorial dominance if challenged. Adults and adolescents are hard to distinguish for humans, but vampires can pick up on subtle differences and have a trained eye. Studies have shown that even without any cultural markers (such as dress, jewelry or hair style), most adolescent and adult vampires can reliably estimate another vampire's age.

---

Newborns however often fail at this, which might point to this being a learned skill and not instinctual knowledge.

An adult's more solitary lifestyle allows traveling further away from their spawning grounds. Nomadic vampires are remain mostly unknown, and only very few search the spotlight. They will usually hang around night clubs and bars, where they can use the large crowd to blend in while they mingle with humans to find potential mates. They will usually be accompanied by some of their older children, who act as scouts for new territory and hunting grounds.

The drive to procreate, similar to human sexuality, is baked into their primal makeup. Adult vampires will have an active sex drive and have intercourse with humans they find attractive, interesting, or just out of boredom.

Vampires can easily become multiple centuries old, and some records suggest sires who have been around for over a millennium. However, those cases are extremely rare and over

---

represented.

# Procreation 

They themselves cannot produce biological children, but this is not an issue as they "hitchhike"their human partner is now considered a "dormant host" of vampirism. They will not turn, but have the genetic material to pass on the trait stored inside their bodies. This works regardless of gender, and doesn't require the sex to be penetrative or heterosexual.

The affected human's next child will have vampirism as a genetic blueprint that might express itself at around twenty or thirty years of age - or be carried into the next generation. Those pseudo-humans are basically the vampire's "larvae" that live undetected amongst humans until they transform. Those humans are themselves unaware of their vampirism and will usually assume themselves to be completely ordinary, unless someone educates them on the matter.

Due to sexism and heteronormativity, a lot of people assume only human women can carry on vampirism if they had sex with a male vampire. Most carriers of the genetic material however are actually cisgender men who had sex with female vampires, and a significant portion will have this trait acquired by homosexual activity.

## Appearance, ears, hair, and skin

The dormant genetic information from their sire might change their appearance drastically, but it is still very much up to random chance. Within the first years some newborns might lose all pigmentation and develop a special case of albinism. The stereotype of the extremely pale vampire isn't entirely false, but it represents only about 10-15\% of the population. The majority keeps their skin tone, but appears more light-skinned due to a lack of sunlight. Vampires will usually lose their hair pigmentation as soon as they transform. Their hair will usually have a grey or white tone as it grows in. Some vampires use dye, much like humans do, and it is an integral part of self care in a lot of vampiric communities to take care of one's hair as a sign of age and status.

Vampire claws are often mistaken for long nails - this could not be further from the truth. Their claws are part of their body and should be handled by a trained surgeon if they request them to be filed to a "human" length. Requiring a vampire to "cut their nails" is like telling someone to cut off their fingertips.

---

![img-11.jpeg](Elias'%20Vampirism%20biology%20cheat%20sheet_img-11.jpeg)

While on a first glance vampires have long nails, their claws are actually extensions of their skeleton. Removing them is in no way analogous to a manicure.

Usually, newborns will experience some subtle changes in their facial structure, and they will often have a noticeable resemblance to other spawn from the same sire.
Over time, a vampire's ears will develop a pointy shape. We do not yet know why this feature has developed. Some researchers suggest it might be a way for vampires to signal their age and stage of development to others - since it is so integral to their social life, a clear difference is crucial for the colony to work if it has hundreds of members that might have never met before. An adult's ear shape and teeth are its only visual characteristics that reliably distinguish it from a newborn spawn. While smell is another way to tell the difference for a vampire to tell the age of another one, this might not be possible in large crowds where scents mix and obscure one another.

# Eyesight and the evolution of color vision 

The striking color of the vampire's eye have puzzled many researchers. While some might have brown or blue eyes, the majority are some shade of striking, deep yellow or red.
Modern theories assume a practical evolutionary adaption. A red iris might work better to filter certain wavelengths in the dark. (Red eyes in the dark - the evolution of vampire vision, Dr. Tchakovsky at Prague Institute for the Supernatural).

---

![img-13.jpeg](Elias'%20Vampirism%20biology%20cheat%20sheet_img-13.jpeg)

Another adaption of the eye to the dark is UV vision. Like many nocturnal animals, vampires see a wider spectrum of light. This fundamentally changes the way they see the world and what they find interesting - since they can often see glowing vibrant colors where humans cannot, and vice versa.

Vampires might apply UV markings in their environments that aren't visible to human eyes. These can be created from minerals and might have been used for hundreds of years as a way to communicate in secret and in low-light environments.
This practice is still around, but most vampires nowadays will just use mail or the internet instead. Private forums and social media groups have largely replaced old customs.

Historically some powders were applied as makeup for their UV reactivity, but a few of them were toxic and often expensive to produce. Fur and feathers with uv reactivity are usually part of traditional garments still to this day.
Nowadays cheap, mass produced uv reactive face paint is popular due to its easy availability, low cost and color options. In some impoverished urban communities, vampires also use sun screen to create intricate patterns on their bodies.

While they see much better in the dark than humans thanks to their eyes, vampires are partially color blind and have much worse daytime vision. It also makes them rather sensitive to bright

---

lights. To avoid "snow blindness" (very common with UV vision) they possess a retractable second eyelid, which is a translucent layer that protects the pupils from UV light, as well as from debris and dryness. This allows them to sleep with open eyes, which might help to keep away predators when they enter stasis.

Additionally, vampires have a reflective layer (tapetum lucidum) that enhances night vision which causes their eyes to reflect light and make them glow in the dark when light hits the reflective surface (like many other animals, like cats, rabbits, owls,...).
![img-14.jpeg](Elias'%20Vampirism%20biology%20cheat%20sheet_img-14.jpeg)

# Spawngrounds 

The transformation is usually triggered by the local presence of other vampires from the same hive. A prolonged presence of vampires from the same region will create a strong hormonal trigger for any dormant vampirism from the same source to express itself, since newborn vampires require older "family members" to feed and protect them. A short-term presence will not be sufficient, so this only happens when vampires settle somewhere, or if an adult vampire creates offspring concentrated in one area and leaves some older spawns there as "guardians" to watch over newborn.

This place will then often act as a spawning ground for local vampire populations. Usually this requires vampires from the same family to stay in the same place for at least twenty years - long enough for their children with dormant vampirism transform.

Another way the transformation can be triggered is if a dormant vampire moves into a spawning ground (usually by accident). This might look like a human moving to another city and suddenly transforming "out of nowhere". Usually, most big cities and urban areas will have this effect. Due to modern living conditions, this leads to a lot of problems as newborns are unable to fend for themselves and often die alone without being found by others.

If there are no vampire colony nearby at all, the trait stays dormant and will be carried over to the next generation. Like this, vampirism can stay alive even after humans try to purge the trait by mass killing a local vampire family. Vampirism can skip several generations before expressing itself again, making it extremely hard to eradicate once present in a population.

---

Dormant vampirism will cause some issues for its hosts. Humans with this trait might have a higher chance of autoimmune diseases, hemoglobin disorders, anemia, and intersex conditions. Dormant vampirism is extremely hard to detect even with modern technology. There is no blood test that can reliably tell a human if their body is technically vampiric. However, if a family member has recently transformed, chances are high first and second degree relatives are affected.

Since the trait is not indefinitely transmittable, not all members of a human family carry it. It affects the children born after one of their parents has had sex with an adult vampire and their future offspring, but the trait cannot jump to a sexual partner. Vampirism can survive in human families for hundreds of years - but the human body learns how to fight it in the womb, making it less and less likely to be expressed in their offspring. It is estimated that beyond the 8th generation in a family, vampirism is successfully contained by the host's immune response.

If humans know that a child might be affected, it is unfortunately common for them to ostracize it, or in some cases, even try to kill it.
Some human mothers will give those children away to be raised by e.g. a church, in the hopes that they might "cure" it. (Monks with fangs - a historical investigation, Prof. Dr. Wermut, Theology professor at Eastgate university)

Monasteries can sometimes be a secret safe haven for vampires, and humans are more willing to accept vampires if they become monks or nuns. Archeological evidence suggests that at least a quarter of monasteries acted as refuges for newborn spawn, whose instinctual obedience and eagerness to please made them valued workers.

Once the vampiric trait is expressed, it hits a genetic dead end as spawn are sterile until they enter their adult stage two hundred years later. This is why vampires rely on humans to procreate - their own maturation process is too slow to be sustainable. Their mortality rate and slow development requires a relation of at least around five hundred to a thousand spawn to one adult.

Vampirism cannot be fully avoided if it is already in the family, but condoms are a reliable way to avoid the issue. Modern cases of vampire transformation are mostly genetic and not sexually transmitted. As there is thousands of years of sexual history, at least a third of any family tree will carry some form of dormant vampirism - however, human immune systems have caught up and are better at suppressing the trait. In modern medicine, vampirism is treated as a genetic risk factor, but does not determine one's future. Some people believe in the possibility of a vaccine that can permanently "cure" vampirism, but so far nothing like this has been developed. Humans who know they have a high chance of turning into a vampire might disclose their "dormant" status to their partner, but many keep it secret due to prevalent societal stigma. In many cases,

---

humans take this knowledge to the grave, which can create a sometimes nasty surprise for the next generation who has no idea that vampirism exists in their genetic makeup. Advocates for vampire rights try to promote better communication within families with the trait, so newborn vampires are not completely unprepared and ignorant of their own nature.

Rarely, couples who both carry vampirism might even be okay with the high risk and might even educate themselves on their hypothetical vampiric child, and in some parts of the world raising a vampire would be considered honorable and a sign of fortune.

# Social role systems and gender 

As already mentioned, vampires work inside a large, hive-like family structure that can include hundreds of individuals at any given point in time. Adult vampires are the only ones capable of procreation and practice a nomadic lifestyle, while their children stay in their spawnground hive where they have different roles depending on their age. A spawn's biology is hardwired to make them their sires loyal subject and subsequently to any older vampire in the hive. This helps the colony to keep the social order stable even when sires are usually absent. Only if the decisions of an older vampire in the colony endangers the group with e.g. strange and reckless behavior, spawn and adolescents might band together to remove the individual.

Spawns are workers, farmers, cleaners and servants. They tend to the land and take care of life stock - usually cows, pigs or other mammals who have large amounts of blood in their bodies.

Older adolescent vampires act as guardians and caretakers of newborns. They stay longer in the same region and maintain a steady presence. Younger members will maintain sources of life stock and nutrition and act as workers and servants. These structures are similar to how e.g. naked moles or bees live. The strong hierarchy is crucial to the success of the species and vampires will instinctively have a primal drive to be part of their hive. Vampires can recognize each other by smell and looks and will instantly know if the other belongs to their colony. Adolescents are especially susceptible to the scent of dormant spawn (who still look and act like humans, and oftentimes have no idea what they really are) and grow extremely protective of them. They know from experience almost to the day when a transformation might happen, and wait close by. Humans with dormant vampirism will often talk about someone "watching them" during this time.

While vampires have strict roles, they have a very fluid concept of gender and procreation. Families work without the need for heterosexuality or a father-mother relationship. The young are raised by their older siblings, and workloads and tasks are divided by age. While newborn spawn often cling to their assigned gender role from their time as humans, over time the concept loses its appeal and importance in their daily lives. Clothing styles and mannerisms become more fluid, and humans might struggle to tell the assigned sex of a vampire. In some colonies, young

The androgyne appearance of the Vampire is not solely a cultural phenomenon. An adult vampire who was assigned male at birth and one who was assigned female will have similar if not identical levels of testosterone and estrogen. After their initial transformation, their bodies' endocrine system slowly change over the span of several decades, and after their first hundred years posttransformation most vampires will display some intersex traits. Sometimes, adult vampires have such an ambiguous physiology that it becomes impossible to tell what their birth sex was.

Some biologists suggest that vampires should be classed as an inherently intersex species, but there is still much debate on the topic. Nowadays, there is a notable amount of spawn who define themselves as some form of intersex or transgender, and some reject human gender as a social identity altogether. Since breast development (gynecomastia) is a side effect of their altered endocrine system, vampires who were assigned male at birth might develop gender dysphoria. Same goes for some assigned female at birth vampires who notice the effect of testosterone with increased body hair and voice changes. On the other side, vampires who suffered from gender dysphoria previously to their transformation usually welcome this change. In any case, a lot of vampires require access to gender affirming care such as top surgery or hormone therapy. (Vampirism, Queerness and Drag Culture, Dr. Kalidh et al)

Adult vampires often do perform gender roles in an exaggerated fashion to attract human mates, but this is not something that comes naturally to them. Some might change their gender presentation over time or even change their name multiple times over the centuries to reflect their identity.

Due to a vampire's inherent similarities to human trans- and intersex people, humans tend to conflate them, and discrimination against one group will often spill over to the other.

# Territory, colony life, and old age 

Hierarchy and territorial control is one of the most important aspects of vampiric social life. This will result in customs that may seem odd to humans. Vampires will not enter someone's house unless invited, because they know that it could get them killed. This goes as far as not even entering houses in emergency situations, and some vampires would rather risk their wellbeing than disrespect another vampire's hive or hunting grounds. There are only few exceptions to this, like rescuing hive members or feeding newborn, which are usually considered acceptable reasons to cross territorial lines.

If a vampire in the colony becomes an adult while another adult is already present, the younger one is forced to leave the territory. If they try to stay, this will usually cause a deadly and brutal conflict. This rarely happens however, as vampires will prefer to stay on good terms with their

---

fellow spawn and often keep close ties with their siblings even after leaving their spawning ground. Since only $1-2 \%$ of vampires ever reach adulthood, the hierarchy is challenged only every hundred years or so.

The mortality rate of newborns is so high that adult vampires often prefer to stay emotionally detached until their young are at least in their adolescence. Most will die within their first decades and therefore do not live significantly longer than humans (25-30 years of human life plus 50 years of spawnhood makes around eighty years). The 100th birthday is seen as a big milestone and most consider it a vampire's first step towards adulthood and longevity. At this point they are considered for guardian roles and take on more responsibility in the colony. Adolescent vampires typically take care of a dozen newborn spawn together and take turns feeding and watching new members of a hive. This role is very demanding and adolescents might try to purposefully abandon weak newborns or even kill them when the circumstances are dire.

Adults are responsible for procreation, expanding the territory and creating new spawngrounds. They are usually traveling with older adolescents commonly referred to as Scouts. They will travel far distances and might never return to the majority of the hives that belong to their colony.

When adult sires reach the age of around five hundred years or older, they settle in their most recently formed hive and become what is sometimes called a "castle dwelling" vampire. They live in a safeguarded area protected by their hive, and spend most of their time in this location. They will enter stasis more and more often to maintain their beauty and health, but eventually, might not wake up anymore. At this point, they start dying.

As their bodies stay in permanent stasis, they are naturally preserved by their own protective fluids. Dying vampires could technically be forced to wake up even after decades, but this is considered cruel and sadistic - pretty much analogous with elder abuse amongst humans. Elders who are forced to wake up are dangerous, spiteful creatures and many archeologists have met their end opening the wrong casket. Younger vampires often guard their elder's tombs from raiders, and make sure their sires have a dignified death. As the dying Vampire's body is coated with layers of acidic fluid and slowly petrified, they eventually leave behind a mummified husk.

# Human-raised Vampires 

If a vampire is raised by humans with no contact to a hive, things get a little messy and vampires might imprint very strongly on "their" humans. Due to the difference in lifespan as well as hierarchy and physical needs, those vampires develop rather anxious personalities, with exaggerated obedience towards the humans that they consider part of their "colony". If given enough space and patience, they can be well adjusted family members, but they need some extra attention and consideration. Feeding from humans is perfectly fine as a substitute for

newborns, but it does not have the fast healing effect and nutritional value of vampire blood. Meat and diary can be added to the diet to mitigate some of this. Humans will also get infections and diseases from bites, even if a vampire's saliva itself is relatively sterile, insufficient wound aftercare still poses risks.

Some specialized hospitals and pharmacies offer supplemental formulas that can be added to water or fresh animal blood to be given orally. While not ideal, this can prevent acute starvation in many cases.

In some regions, where humans are tolerant towards vampirism, newborn might also spend their first decades among their human families of origin, and only transition into vampire society later in life.

# Morality, misunderstandings and superstition 

There is no inherent "evil" to vampirism that wouldn't be present in humans generally. Their food aggression while starving is pretty on par with their human peers, and vampires rarely kill humans for blood unless they are really desperate- much like starving humans would kill one another for resources.

However, vampires work so different biologically and socially that humans regard them as dangerous.

To humans, vampires stalk unsuspecting humans and turn them into their slaves. They often do

---

not know how exactly vampires procreate and assume it is through biting and blood rituals. The randomness of the transformation adds an additional layer of paranoia.

Due to the sudden "death" of a human during the transformation into a vampire, many consider the human part of the person to have died. Humans will often completely reject vampires after their transformation and regard them as barely sentient - they see them as zombies only driven by bloodlust and slaves to their masters. Their territorial behavior and fight over scarce resources is interpreted as random savage violence - "they kill their own kind more often than we do".

In some cases vampirism is integrated into human society. This usually happens at old, historic spawning grounds - generations of human families have lived with vampires in their homes. In those cases, those vampires extend their protective and nurturing qualities to humans and become well-regarded companions and protectors of their settlement. Having a vampire in your family is seen as a sign of good fortune and they will often be included in religious ceremonies.

In modern, urban environments, hive structures often reach a critical breaking point. In individualist cultures with capitalism and 9-5 jobs and paying rent, forming a commune to take care of newborns is increasingly difficult if not impossible. Vampires often end up homeless and severely malnourished, and eventually perpetually institutionalized. Many do not make it past the first years of the transformation stage. Even relatively well-off newborn will struggle immensely due to the social isolation and the rate of depression and nervous disorders is exceptionally high for this population.

Young spawn showing his scarred arms. Biting oneself is a common soothing method for newborn, and this happens unfortunately largely due to neglect, anxiety and chronic starvation. Hospitals can offer transfusions as an emergency treatment, but in many places it is not allowed to offer a vampire an oral administration of blood.

Self-sustaining farming of life stock for blood is often not an option and strict government laws and police crackdowns on vampire hives create a tense and chaotic environment for spawn. This will result in cases of desperate violence and the death of e.g. free roaming family pets (such as cats) as starving spawn use any opportunity to feed. Some vampires will organize in small groups to break into farms to feed on cows or pigs. Those cases are used by politicians and "concerned citizens" to justify the killing and imprisonment of vampires.

# Undead thugs break into farm, drink pig's blood 

By JOHN BEYER

In the early hours of Wednesday morning, a group of Undead broke into the Miller Family Farm and helped themselves to what they likely consider a gourmet meal: pig blood.

According to Farmer Bernhard Miller, who discovered the aftermath just after dawn, the intruders bypassed locks, gates, and common decency to access the barn where their hogs were sleeping peacefully.
"They didn't kill them," Miller said, still visibly shaken. "But they drained a few of them enough to make them woozy. Laverne, my prize sow, was covered in her own blood."

Local veterinarian Dr. Minnie Rose confirmed the pigs are expected to make a full recovery after a weekend of electrolytes, rest, and, in her words, "therapy, probably."

Selling animal blood to vampires is sometimes criminalized by governments as it "promotes degeneracy", so there is a lot of black market activity between farmers, butchers and vampire colonies. With the internet, a lot of vampires started to organize in forums. With makeup, modern plastic surgery and dental prosthetics, there is a growing trend of young vampires helping each other to blend in and live undetected amongst humans.

Modern human rights groups slowly start to question this narrative and some advocate for a more empathetic approach. However, there is a lot of emphasis on the "recovery" and "cure" from vampirism, which many vampires themselves are not happy with. Environmentalists promote the conservation of vampire colonies as important ecological keystones, but usually those arguments fall on deaf ears.
