# QUANTUM SPELLBOOK 

SPELLS INSPIRED BY PHYSICS

In certain worlds, magic is not recognized as an esoteric energy drawn from the Weave-it is branded "science", understood by its laws and interactions. It's unclear who has the right of the situation: whether magic is an extension of the laws of nature, a completely unconnected essence, or some middle ground where magic and science coexist. In any case, it behooves a magic-user to understand the laws of nature before they tamper in them.

## SPELL DESCRIPTIONS

## ABSOLUTE ZERO

7th-level evocation
Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a shard of ice)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You sap the heat of a creature within range, leaving their body crystallizing near absolute zero. Choose a creature within range. The target must succeed a Constitution saving throw or be restrained as their limbs and muscles freeze. At the end of their next turn, the target must make another Constitution saving throw. On a second failed save, the target freezes into a solid statue of ice and is petrified for the duration. If the target succeeds on either saving throw, the spell ends.

## BLACK HOLE

6th-level evocation
Time: 1 action
Range: 90 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You create a 5 -foot radius superdense sphere of matter within range that consumes everything it touches. Any creature that comes within 10 feet of the sphere must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pulled 10 feet in a straight line towards the sphere. Due to the sphere's gravity, the 10 -foot radius surrounding the sphere is considered difficult terrain.
A creature that starts their turn within 5 feet of the sphere takes 8 d 6 force damage

as they are compressed by the rampant forces of gravity near the superdense matter.

## CONDENSE/LIGHTEN

1st-level transmutation
Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You rearrange the atoms of a creature within range, increasing or decreasing their density. Choose either a creature or an object that is neither worn nor carried. If the target is unwilling, it can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell has no effect.

Condense. For the duration, the target weighs twice as much as normal, though its size remains the same. The target has advantage on Strength saving throws, but disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws. Additionally, effects that would physically move you, such as the thunderwave spell, only move you half their normal distance.

Lighten. For the duration, the target weighs half as much as normal, though its size remains the same. The target has advantage on Dexterity saving throws, but disadvantage on Strength saving throws. Additionally, effects that would physically move you, such as the thunderwave spell, move you twice their normal distance.

## FIELD OF FORCE

4th-level evocation
Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a small magnet)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a 15 -foot radius field of gravitational force within range, which lasts for the duration. Choose one of the following options. A creature that starts its turn in the field must make a Strength saving throw, and on a failed save suffers the chosen effect. Objects that aren't being worn or carried and aren't adhered to the ground in some way are also affected by the field.

Attraction. The field attracts creatures and objects towards its core. The target is pulled 10 feet in a straight line towards the center of the field. A creature moving away from the center of the field while inside it is moving through difficult terrain.

Repulsion. The field repels creatures and objects from its core. The target is pushed 10 feet in a straight line away from the center of the field. A creature moving towards the center of the field while inside it is moving through difficult terrain.

## GRAVITON CRUSH

5th-level evocation
Time: 1 action
Range: 90 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
You summon the forces of gravity to crush a creature within range. The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 6 d 10 force damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell with a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1 d 10 for each slot level above 5th.

---

## GRAVITY LANCE

3rd-level evocation
Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
You fashion a lance out of pure gravitational force and spear a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 5d8 force damage, and must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 10 feet away from you in a straight line.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell with a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1 d 8 for each slot level above 3rd.

## INTANGIBILITY

3rd-level transmutation
Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 minute
You touch a creature within range and rob their solidity, rendering them intangible. A creature unwilling to become intangible can make a Constitution saving throw to resist this effect. On a failed save, the creature and everything they are wearing or holding becomes intangible for the duration.
An intangible creature can't physically interact with other creatures or objects, including making weapon attacks, lifting objects, or casting spells that require it to touch other creatures. An intangible creature can pass through solid objects and creatures as if they were difficult terrain.
If the target is inside a solid object when
the spell ends, it is shunted into the nearest unoccupied space big enough to contain them, and it takes one point of force damage for every foot it was moved in this way.

## INTENSE GRAVITY ZONE

4th-level evocation
Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a small obsidian bead)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You create a 15 -foot radius zone within range where the forces of gravity are massively amplified. A creature that enters this zone, including when the zone appears, must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
Regardless of whether a creature succeeds, the zone is considered difficult terrain due to the crushing forces weighing down every step. Additionally, physical projectiles in this zone, such as bolts and sling bullets, are instantly slammed into the ground, causing ranged attacks that pass through the zone to fail.

## PERPETUAL MOTION FIELD

2nd-level transmutation
Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You create a 10-foot radius field where the laws of inertia don't apply, and things in motion must remain in motion. A creature or object that enters this field travels in a straight line until it leaves the field unless it is tethered to an object outside the field in

---

some way. This movement costs the creature no movement speed, as they exert no energy in order to move. Creatures with no movement speed, such as paralyzed and unconscious creatures, are still affected by the field, regardless of their inability to move.

## QUANTUM BOND

5th-level transmutation
Time: 1 minute
Range: Touch
Components: S
Duration: 1 day
You touch two inanimate objects no larger than a 2 -foot cube in size and entangle them on a quantum level, bonding them across space.

A pair of bonded objects reflect each other's states: if one object is altered, the other object alters to reflect the change. For instance, marking one object with ink, scorch marks, or scratches causes identical marks to appear on the bonded object, unless that object is in some way resistant to receiving the change. For instance, you could not bond a mundane object to a magical one and destroy the magical object through ordinary means, as magical objects are resistant to ordinary means of destruction.

If both bonded objects have an interior space and you place an item inside, the item is present in both objects until it is removed from one, at which point it disappears from the other. In the event that two creatures attempt to pull an item from inside the bonded objects at the same time, flip a coin to determine who receives the item.

If one of the bonded objects is taken to a
different plane without its partner, the bond ends.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell with a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the duration increases to 7 days (6th level), 1 month (7th level), 1 year (8th level), or until dispelled (9th level).

## QUANTUM BOX

4th-level conjuration
Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S, M (a tiny lead box)
Duration: 8 hours
You conjure a black hinged box warded with quantum energies for the duration. The box can house an object as large as 2 feet in any dimension.

An object stored in the box has its qualities suppressed as if it doesn't exist. If the item generates heat, magic, or some other form of energy, that energy is limited to the confines of the box, and can't affect or damage anything outside the box. Magic items with passive effects take no effect while inside the box, and effects with a duration are suspended until they leave the box, at which point the duration and effects resume. Additionally, objects inside the box cannot be made the target of any spell short of a wish spell, including divination and conjuration spells that would remove the item from the box.

The box is near indestructible, but a disintegrate spell will cause it to turn to ash, revealing any objects inside.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell with a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the duration increases to 1 day (6th level), 7

---

days (6th level), 1 month (7th level), 1 year (8th level), or until dispelled (9th level).

## RAY OF ENTROPY

2nd-level evocation
Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
You create a ray of void energy that saps the heat and life of a creature within range. The target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 2d8 cold damage and 2d8 necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell with a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1 d 8 cold damage and 1 d 8 necrotic damage for every two slot levels above 2nd.

## REDIRECT ENERGY

3rd-level abjuration
Time: 1 reaction
Range: Self
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 minute
When you are made the target of an effect that deals acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage, you can cast this spell to absorb and contain some of that energy inside your body. The next weapon attack you make within the duration deals additional damage equal to half the damage you took from the attack that triggered this spell. This damage is of the same type as the triggering damage.
If you haven't made a weapon attack by
the end of this spell's duration, the spell ends and the energy is wasted.

## SPATIAL LOCK

4th-level abjuration
Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a length of gold chain)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
Chains of pure force bind an object no larger than a 5 -foot cube within range. For the duration, the object is locked in space, preventing its motion.
If a creature or outside force attempts to move the object, make a Constitution saving throw, as if maintaining concentration. On a roll of 10 or higher, the object is unaffected and the spell continues. On a roll of 9 or less, the object doesn't move, but the chains disappear and the spell ends.

## SUBLIMATION

5th-level transmutation
Time: 1 action
Range: 90 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
You focus on a 20-foot radius within range, causing water in the area to sublimate. Choose one of the effects below.

Evaporate. You cause any moisture in the area to flash-boil into scalding hot steam. Any creature in the area must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 8d8 fire damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one. Any bodies of water containing 10 gallons or less in the area evaporate into steam and then dissipate.

Condense. You cause any moisture in

---

the region to flash-freeze into razor-sharp ice crystals in the air. Any creature in the area must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 8d8 cold damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one. Any clouds of fog or mist in the area condense into crystals, then shatter and disappear.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell with a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1 d 8 for every slot level above 5th.

## TIME STUTTER

3rd-level transmutation
Time: 1 reaction
Range: Self
Components: V
Duration: Instantaneous
When you take damage, you can cast this spell to cause time to stutter back a second, giving you a second chance to react. If the attack was a roll made against you, the attacker rolls again and takes the new result. If the damage was caused by a failed saving throw, you roll the saving throw again and take the new result.

## VACUUM PALM

6th-level evocation
Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: S
Duration: Instantaneous
You strike a creature and pull all the air from their lungs. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 10d8 necrotic damage and is incapacitated until the end of their next
turn as they choke and gasp for breath. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and isn't incapacitated.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell with a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 2 d 8 for every slot level above 6th.

## WEIGHTLESS QUIVER

2nd-level transmutation
Time: 1 bonus action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
You touch a quiver of ammunition and enchant its contents. For the duration, ammunition from this quiver isn't affected by the forces of gravity, flying in a straight line. Ranged weapon attacks made with this ammunition can be made in the weapon's far range without suffering disadvantage.
The spell's magic ends on the piece of ammunition when it hits or misses, and the spell ends when ten pieces of ammunition have been drawn from the quiver.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell with a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the number of pieces of ammunition you can affect with this spell increases by two for every slot level above 2nd.
