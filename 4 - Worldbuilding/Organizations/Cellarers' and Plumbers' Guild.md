# Cellarers' and Plumbers' Guild

The **Cellarers' and Plumbers' Guild** was a guild in [Waterdeep](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Waterdeep) that dug building foundations and maintained [Waterdeep's sewer system](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Waterdeep/Sewers).[[4]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Cellarers%27_%26_Plumbers%27_Guild#cite_note-WWiW-p52-4)

## Base of Operations

The Old Guildhall was located on [Gaustus Street](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Gaustus_Street) in the [Trades Ward](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Trades_Ward_of_Waterdeep).[[1]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Cellarers%27_%26_Plumbers%27_Guild#cite_note-WWiW-p39-1) [[2]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Cellarers%27_%26_Plumbers%27_Guild#cite_note-CS-2)

## Activities

The guild was employed to dig foundations and maintain the city's sewer system. They kept the sewers well-maintained.[[5]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Cellarers%27_%26_Plumbers%27_Guild#cite_note-CoS.W-p121-5) They used secret recipes to perform their maintenance duties and ordered their materials from others rather than making them themselves. Although they didn't always do so, the Cellarers and Plumbers had to call the Loyal Order of Street Laborers to fill in any holes that they had dug.[[1]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Cellarers%27_%26_Plumbers%27_Guild#cite_note-WWiW-p39-1)

## Tactics

Frequently, the guild would dig up valuables and corpses during their excavations. They were required to inform the owner of the property beneath which the objects were found but commonly, they did not bother to do so unless being directly observed by said owner. Rumors were rife that the guild created nonfunctional pipelines in the sewers in which they could hide these things.[[6]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Cellarers%27_%26_Plumbers%27_Guild#cite_note-6)

## Relationships

Members of the Carpenters', Roofers', and Plasterers' Guild were seen as "thick-fingered clods" by the Cellarers and Plumbers but they reserved the majority of their derision for the Loyal Order of Street Laborers, whose formation took profitable work away from the Cellarers and Plumbers.[[1]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Cellarers%27_%26_Plumbers%27_Guild#cite_note-WWiW-p39-1)

## History

In [1356 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1356_DR), Orlar Sarluk published a book titled _[Down the Drain: A Life in the Guild of Cellarers and Plumbers](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Down_the_Drain:_A_Life_in_the_Guild_of_Cellarers_and_Plumbers)_.[[7]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Cellarers%27_%26_Plumbers%27_Guild#cite_note-BST-p25-7)

During the [Time of Troubles](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Time_of_Troubles), a large group of Cellarers were lost in the city's sewers. Unbeknownst to all, they had been transformed into [cursts](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Curst).[[8]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Cellarers%27_%26_Plumbers%27_Guild#cite_note-CoS.W-124-8)

In [1367 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1367_DR), many Cellarers, including the guildmaster, began to be enslaved by the Savants of the Dark Tide. The Cellarers were the only organized group within the sewers, and the [aboleths](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Aboleth) of the Dark Tide wanted to keep them under their control so that their presence in the sewers wouldn't be detected.[[9]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Cellarers%27_%26_Plumbers%27_Guild#cite_note-CoS.W-p57-9)

In [1479 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1479_DR), [Laraelra Harsard](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Laraelra_Harsard), daughter of the guildmaster, hired [Meloon Wardragon](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Meloon_Wardragon) to investigate a problem (namely a collapsed wall) for the guild. That event led Laraelra and Meloon to discovering that [Vajra Safahr](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Vajra_Safahr), the Blackstaff's Heir, was being tortured in a cellar. The two and their allies eventually rescued Vajra.[[10]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Cellarers%27_%26_Plumbers%27_Guild#cite_note-BsT-10)

## Membership

*   There were no halfling members in [1479 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1479_DR).[[11]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Cellarers%27_%26_Plumbers%27_Guild#cite_note-BST-p123-125-11)
*   Despite their superior skill working with rock, there were also relatively few [dwarven](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Dwarf) members of the guild as a result of discrimination by the other races in the guild.[[10]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Cellarers%27_%26_Plumbers%27_Guild#cite_note-BsT-10)

### Guild Dues and Fees

| Item             | Cost         |
| ---------------- | ------------ |
| Joining Fee      | 5 gold pieces |
| Monthly Dues     | 7 silver pieces |
| Pay per Job/Day  | 2 gold pieces |
| Food/Drink Stipend per Day | 10 gold pieces |

Members had to pay five [gold pieces](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Gold_piece) to join and guild dues of seven [silver pieces](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Silver_piece) per month. In exchange, they were paid two gold pieces per job per day, all of their materials were also paid for and teams were given a ten-gold-piece stipend for food and drink per day, making them the best-paying service guild in the city.[[1]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Cellarers%27_%26_Plumbers%27_Guild#cite_note-WWiW-p39-1)

The uniform of a Cellarer and Plumber was a deep orange cap and cloak with a red border. They typically wore leather armor and remained armed, to deal with the dangers of the sewers.[[9]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Cellarers%27_%26_Plumbers%27_Guild#cite_note-CoS.W-p57-9)

## Leadership

In [1374 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1374_DR), the guildmaster had been Master Plumber [Hilithiimm Turnstone](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Hilithiimm_Turnstone) for many years and he planned to turn leadership over to his son [Jhalossan](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Jhalossan_Turnstone) when he retired.[[12]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Cellarers%27_%26_Plumbers%27_Guild#cite_note-12) As of [1479 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1479_DR), the guild was headed by [Malaerigo Harsard](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Malaerigo_Harsard), the father of the [Blackstaff](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Blackstaff)'s Heir [Laraelra Harsard](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Laraelra_Harsard).[[3]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Cellarers%27_%26_Plumbers%27_Guild#cite_note-BST-p39-3)
