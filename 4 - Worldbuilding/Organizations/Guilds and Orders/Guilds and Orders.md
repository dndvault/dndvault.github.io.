# INTRODUCTION 

Guilds and Orders is a simple resource guide for use at almost any table and any roleplaying game. It lists several possible guilds or orders that you can port into your game and use to augment an adventure through role playing. It's a book that adds depth to a region by giving its people that much more flavor. Below you'll find outlined several guilds and orders, that serve as ready to play creations or as examples of what they should look like. There are entries from the commonly known thieves' guild to the less remembered trade guilds. Whatever the listing, there is more than enough fodder for everyone.

This book is wholly system neutral. The material is good for any role playing game. For that reason, nothing is stated out, guild leaders are not listed, nor any stats given for the rank and file. The few exceptions limit information to hit dice and level. This allows anyone to use it in any game. Where listed, the information is self-explanatory.

The guilds and orders below are written with a simple format. There are several sections divided up between class, such as ranger, rogue, wizard, etc. and in each section are five listed guilds or orders. Each order is introduced, followed by location of their guild hall, the organization of the guild, a list of its titles, the guild's wealth and influence and a brief discussion of its origins. All this information is easy to use or discard as the game master or players sees fit.

The entries take one of two forms, a small guild contained in one location or town, or a large guild that has multiple branches in multiple locations. As noted above, none of this is written in stone, change or alter the guild or order as best fits your game and style of play. The Gravel Mongers, a thieves' guild, is written up with only one guild hall in one town. If it suits your game nothing should stop you from making the Mongers a guild hall that is spread out through the whole region, in all its towns and halls. The same goes true for larger guilds. Written as if they were spread all over the realms, restrict them to one area if desired.

Guilds can and should be part of any ongoing role playing campaign. Coming up with the on the fly is difficult and time consuming, but with luck, this book will help fill in that gap, supplying the table with a host of new adventures from the mundane street battles with the Granite Men to the more elaborate dance of thievery with the Whip Jacks.

## 2 TROLL LORD GAMES

## BARD GUILDS

## THE IRON POETS GUILD

This guild of traveling bards is known throughout the land, for her members are hard fighting minstrels who enjoy satire and humor. They travel in small bands or with other groups seeking out their own adventures that they can turn into tales and songs. It consists of bards of all walks of life, but they must be dedicated to a life of adventure. They are loved by many, for when they entertain they often sing songs of their own exploits with a subtle self-deprecating humor about them. Few walk away from a song of an Iron Poet feeling aggrieved or aggravated. Their humor of course serves to make crowds happy, but also to provide a subtle mask for their power.

Location: There are many guild halls for the Iron Poets. Usually in small towns or villages, their halls consist of walledin courtyards and several tavern-like and inn-like buildings. Generally self-sufficient the bards employ a small staff of people to provide food, water, clean the place and take care of normal day to day affairs. They are supported by local city government and payments made by members. There is almost always a Minstrel in charge of a guild hall.

Guild Structure: The guild is very loosely structured with each guild hall managing its own affairs. Members who stay in the hall must pay room and board and usually conduct some task such as cutting wood, gardening, etc. They must also work for the guild in some capacity during their stay. The guild offers its members' services to local merchants, drinking establishments, lords and ladies, and other customers. The payments for these services go into guild coffers.

| Iron Poets Guild Ranking |  |
| :-- | :-- |
| Rank/Level | Title |
| $1-5$ | Sagaman |
| $6-9$ | Minstrel |
| 10 | Bard |
| $11+$ | Master Bard |

Wealth and influence: The Iron Poets are a wealthy group of minstrels who have the corner on many entertainment venues in many cities. Other bards are usually blocked out and forced to ply their skills in run-down sections of town. Their commitment to battle and plunder has given the guild tremendous wealth, which has in turn allowed it to buy into all levels of society. It is common to meet an Iron Poet at the right hand of a monarch and see another serving a merchant's caravan.

History: The Iron Poets sprang up from a need to organize and control the payments rendered to bards from noble families. Its founder's desire to both earn money and cull it from his personal adventures set the guild apart in both attitude and musical composition.

## LOREMASTERS GUILD

They are a guild of bards, scholars, seers and similar people whose particular bent is to gather the lore of various regions and peoples. Consisting of humans and demi-humans in almost equal numbers the Loremasters have access to a vast sea of knowledge. It is broken into several schools, each dedicated to a local region, and those Loremasters that dwell there are tasked with mastering its history. The material is written down in book and scrolls and stored at the libraries. Some is turned into oral history and retold to peoples far and wide. The Loremasters are well known as teachers and educators.

Location: Each region has a central library where the guild's information on that region is kept. Ranging from the historical to the common forms of flora and fauna, the lore is vast. The libraries themselves serve as book depositories and houses. Guild members live in the halls, always on the first floor where they can offer a line of defense for the library. The guild halls are usually defensible and held by 2-8 bards of various titles. Some of these halls are massive affairs.

Guild Structure: The Loremasters are governed by the Librarians. Each guild house placed under a Librarian's charge. They have access to all the collected scrolls and books as well as the key to their organization. Not all of their members are bards or minstrels, some are able scholars taught to recite litanies of information, sometimes in song format, sometimes not. They welcome new members, allowing any to join who have the abilities to retain information and understand it. Members are taxed $15 \%$ of their income. The monies go to the guild hall maintenance; however the real money comes from payments made to access information or speak with a Librarian.

Loremasters Guild Ranking

| Rank/Level | Title |
| :-- | :-- |
| 1 | Bragi |
| $2-4$ | Travatore |
| $5-7$ | Chronicler |
| $8-9$ | Troubadour |
| $10+$ | Librarian |

Wealth and Influence: The Loremasters are powerful members of almost every town or city where their guild halls are located. Their access to knowledge and willingness to sell it gives them an important role to play in the political machinations of the powers that be. It is well known that access is gained through payments in gold but also in knowledge. Visitors must leave some piece of information, however trivial for the Loremasters. As bards, they travel many lands, seeking information to fill in gaps in tales or histories.

History: A small cabal of bards who devoted their service to the monarch decided, after much abuse, that the information might be handled a little better, and turned into a more lucrative part of their trade. Songs and tales became vessels of collected wisdom and in short order, access was choked off except to those willing to pay. Those willing to pay were often willing to

protect the source of information the bards offered. Soon the idea spread and the bards organized halls everywhere.

## THE UNFORGIVING MASS

A bard's guild dedicated to the dark gods, the Mass consists of a host of races, humans, humanoids, and demi-humans who share a common bent toward evil. They are often in league with local thieves' guilds and both feed off of each other, robbing from any and all they can. There are many rumors about the Unforgiving Mass, their power and influence, but because of the guild's secretive nature, very few actually encounter members, or if they do, they do not know it. They use their craft to beguile people, rob or murder them, kidnap them or set them up for others to do the same. Many areas offer a bounty for a member of the Mass. When caught, they are usually hung, drawn and quartered.

Location: They have no particular guild hall, but travel singly or in small bands. New members are inducted in after traveling with an older member and being secretly tested for the role. Once offered, if someone refuses to join they are almost always murdered. New members are taught a secret language, that is similar to cant and they begin to ply their trade. Individuals retain wealth as would anyone else in the world. The guild's real purpose is almost indistinguishable from any thief guild.

Guild Structure: There is no real organization to the guild beyond that of training new members the tricks of the trade: how to beguile or charm people, rob them or con them out of the money they have. A Patriarch or Matriarch rules the guild, from the settlements on the northern coast. But they have little power and influence over the organization as a whole. Individuals are supposed to journey to them and pay tribute, but some do and other do not.

| Unforgiving Mass Guild Ranking |  |
| :-- | :-- |
| Rank/Level | Title |
| $1-3$ | Scop |
| $4-6$ | Bragi |
| $7-9$ | Rogue |
| $10+$ | Patriarch/Matriarch |

Wealth and influence: The guild has little wealth beyond what each individual member possesses. They so rarely come together to work in concert that they have little or no influence anywhere other than with the gallows men, who regularly hang them.

History: The Unforgiving Mass stems from a community of beggars and thieves whose number included a fair songsmith. Striking on the idea to teach others his craft in order to beguile victims to rob, he set about it with a gusto. Members with musical aptitude were taught and then sent out to ply their trade. At first, they returned to pay tribute but over time it fell apart and only some now return. The guild leader attempts to take back control from time to time, but these very bloody civil wars never end in anything but the status quo.

## THE RED SKALDS

The Skalds are well known as a hard drinking, traveling band of brawling troubadours who spend as much time wooing members of the opposite sex as they do in practicing their trade. The guild consists of mostly humans, though some demi-humans, usually half elves, join their ranks. They are constantly on the road plying their trade, returning to the guild hall when exhaustion or poverty overcomes them. They are not often called upon, nor sought out by any but the indolent lords seeking some wild tale of adventure that often crosses over into the real world. They are not an evil lot, nor use their trade to intentionally hurt others, but are rather a mirth filled club whose actions often leave others in ruins.

Location: The Skalds have built a lodge, the Wolf's Lair, deep in the forests where their members gather to rest, recoup and learn of each other's exploits. The lodge is maintained by a small army of servants and usually guarded by mercenaries paid well to keep the Skalds and their hall safe. A large dungeon lies beneath the Lair and here the Skalds store their various treasures and dues. The location of the lodge is secret though some of the rangers and druids are aware of it.

Guild Structure: There are no leaders of the guild, only a senate of members. Senior members meet to pass edicts, punish members, govern the lodge and set standards. Other members, not in the Senate are allowed to attend and participate, though they do not get a vote. One is chose by common acclaim to govern the Senate and he is called by the other Skalds "First Bard." People join the Skalds only occasionally, for they must have a certain mind set and the necessary skills.

Red Skalds Guild Ranking

| Rank/Level | Title | Notes |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| $1-3$ | Troubadour |  |
| $4-6$ | Minstrel |  |
| $7+$ | Bard | Become a member of the <br> Senate |
| $7+$ | First Bard |  |

Wealth and influence: The Skalds hold a great deal of power. Their many liaisons have left a network of victims behind them that have in turn bartered with the Skalds with information as well as gold. Shared with other guild members its makes the Skalds people who hold secret information on many people. With this power comes risk, and they are often found dead or go missing, themselves the victims of some enraged mark. The lodge itself is home to a mountain of treasure.

History: The Skalds were born in the midst of a brawl. Two brothers working against one another to seduce a nobleman's daughter ran afoul of her brother and his crew. The beating was enough to force them to work in concert. From there the Skalds were born, the original two bards setting the tone for the whole guild that came after.

## THE BARBICAN GUIILD

A guild of noble bards who specialize in voice, from song to tales. They rarely use instruments in their recitations, or on battlefields where they strive to drive their comrades on to greater deeds. The guild consists of humans and demi-humans, being open to all with a clear ability to sway crowds with their renditions of famous odes and poems. The Barbican derives its name from the power of its voice, seen by members as the first line of defense for any beleaguered people, such as is the barbican for a castle. They are well respected and much coveted in anyone's entourage.

Location: The sprawling Castle Lorn sits upon a high cliff overlooking the sea. It is accessed by a narrow spit of land which is itself guarded by several gates and barbicans. The castle is defensible and usually manned by a small retinue of soldiery handpicked by the bards of Lorn. Beneath the castle proper are a series of dungeons that hold the guild's treasure, keep her prisoners and serve as a store house for times of siege. The bards dwell here when not on the road or in another service. Visitors come here often seeking the Barbican Guilds assistance.

Guild Structure: The guild is militant and well armed and because of that it is structured with a clear channel of command. From the Master Bard to the Scop all members serve a role. To join the Barbican one must be inducted by an Odist. Once accepted the member becomes a Scop, advancing over time as their skills determines. The Master Bard rules the guild during times of war or conflict, otherwise a council of $8^{\text {th }}$ level and higher bards rule the order. Each member is required to tithe $10 \%$ of their income to the guild.

| 6 | Sagaman |
| 7 | Travatore |
| 8 | Chronicler |
| 9 | Troubador |
| $10-12$ | Minstrel |
| $13+$ | Master Bard |

Wealth and influence: The Barbican Guild is well established throughout the region and called upon by many, high and low. They are a kindly guild and often stagger their charges by their audience. A day's work at a peasant's wedding might be bought for a few chickens, but a King's wedding might cost a thousand golden coins. For this reason they are loved by all. The Castle Lorn is a powerful, independent fortification and as such offers a military force that is not to be overlooked.

History: Harcove of Lorn was a Warrior-Bard known for the songs he always sang as he waded into battle. As his prowess grew so did his reputation. He hired himself out many times and as his wealth grew it struck him a good idea to expand it. He built the first small keep on the cliffs of Lorn and called others to his side. In time the guild grew as did its wealth and the castle.

## RANGER ORDERS

## DEERSTALKERS

A group of rangers consisting mainly of humans and elves. They are loosely organized with no real guild hierarchy but with a network that allows them to exchange information, knowledge, techniques and anything else of in importance. They primarily hunt brigands, outlaws, raiding parties of humanoids, monsters or scouts for other armies. They are known for their aggressive tactics in bringing targets to bay, often killing them without malice or mercy. They are highly sought after for all these reasons.

Location: The Deerstalkers have no real halls but do have Meets in predesignated areas, usually a druid's holy ground, an old white oak tree, the mouth of a particular spring, etc. They gather on common days such as the solstice, or the spring equinox to exchange news, induct new members, learn from each other, etc. They are territorial with each band picking a base of operations. One ranger, usually a lower level ranger, stays at the base. If one band needs to contact another, they always go to the base.

Guild Structure: They travel in bands of 1-5, with one being the band leader. These range in level from high to low. Band leaders pick up and train new members. As they advance they either stay with the band leader or move on to cut out their own territory. Bands are usually very tight knit and work together well. Frequently bands group together to hunt dangerous or numerous opponents. New members are initiated at a holy site where Meets take place. They enter in as Novitiates. After that they must pass a rigorous number of tests that put their skills to work and their abilities to deal with foes before they are considered Deerstalkers. Those that fail, almost always die.

| Deerstalkers Guild Ranking |  |
| :-- | :-- |
| Rank/Level | Title |
| 1 | Novitiate |
| $2-3$ | Novice |
| $4-5$ | Able |
| $6-7$ | Practiced |
| $8-9$ | Seasoned |
| $10-11$ | Veteran |
| $13+$ | Lord Ranger |

---

Wealth and influence: The Deerstalkers have little influence and almost no wealth to speak of, but their reputations carry them into many circles. Nobles frequently employ them during times of war, or when on, or defending against, raids. Merchants hire them to guide caravans or hunt brigands. Towns hire them to hunt outlaws. They are known for their matter of fact approach to problems that almost always end in death.

History: The guild formed after independent hunters, trackers and rangers began running afoul of each other's territories or taking jobs that interfered with each other. What began as simple courtesies has developed into a loosely structured guild where members look out for each other.

## THE GREEN WATCH

The Green Watch is an order of rangers and their retainers who serve as the eyes and ears of the realm. They are few in number, but highly skilled and capable. These wardens dwell upon the kingdom's edge, patrolling the borders, always on the watch for anything that could be a threat to their lords. They are fiercely loyal, battle hardened and aggressive. They rarely serve as master of the hunt, though more than capable; their skill set is built around more cognizant targets.

Location: The House of the Green Watch is located near the overlord's palace. It's a large building with a huge courtyard where new and old members learn to fight and shoot. The Watch has rooms in other domiciles around the realm, from a room in a minor lord's castle to a bed in a peasant's cottage. More often than not they dwell in the wilds, sleeping under star and moon.

Guild Structure: The guild consists of a Ranger lord and some $48+$ rangers. Rank comes with level and a certain number of amenities. Lower level rangers cannot command other rangers, but when the level of Scout is achieved they are assigned one Huntsmen (a second level ranger). This goes on up the line as referenced below. The rangers are also able to claim hospitality anywhere in the realm as noted below.

| $12-13$ | Ranger Lord | 48 | Keep, 45,000 acre <br> fief; 300gp |

Wealth and influence: The Lord of the Realm relies heavily upon the rangers, using them in almost every conflict that arises as well as relying upon them to keep careful watch. The Ranger Lord and the Rangers are always members of the council and advise or assist as needed. They are used by the merchants and other nobles as well. Because they are well paid in land and money the Green Watch possess a great deal of local power as well.

History: The King called for an order of Huntsmen to form so that he could better protect the kingdom from external and internal threats. The order was founded on a series of structured principles of which loyalty to the crown as the greatest.

## THE ORDER OF THE RED ARM

This band of hunters consists of humans, halflings, half elves and elves. They are known as a stalwart group of scouts and hunters whose skills are more bent toward the traditional hunt than to war. They spend most of their time tracking and locating their prey than they do killing it. That is not to say that Red Arms are a peaceful lot, but rather, when employed, they use their skills to find the prey, step back and let their employer kill it. They are distinguished by the red fletching and marks on their arrow shafts and arms. These they decorate themselves as a mark of honor.

Location: The Red Arm is based out of a large manor house. The manor, called the Red Barracks, consists of several walled acres surrounding one large house, several smaller ones, barns and other out buildings. The wall stands roughly 12 feet tall and is marked by firing stands and small towers. The Barracks is home to the Red Arms and their retainers. The retainers are mostly servants who attend to the manor, making food, etc. They are armed and serve as auxiliary forces in times of need. Here the Red Arms gather to feast, decide guild business, exchange jobs and other sundries business.

Guild Structure: Bands mark the guildsmen's rank and station. These band are tattooed on the ranger's upper right arm. Joining the Red Arms is not difficult, proving a proficiency with tracking and animal husbandry can get one in the door, however, the ranger must be good or of a good nature. The guild takes great pride in its honor and the manner in which they serve those around them. Crimes of any caliber are

---

grounds for immediate expulsion. Crimes that cause harm to the guild are usually punished by beheading. All members are paid per job, but are required to pay $10 \%$ of their earnings in tribute to the guild.

Wealth and influence: The Red Arm is a powerful guild found in a number of towns and cities. Their professionalism, sense of honor and drive to achieve deeds they are paid for makes them highly sought after. The Guild itself is rather wealthy. The Red Barracks is fully fortified, maintained and possessing all the comforts and advantages of a palace.

History: The Red Arm was found by Gervais of Luth with the express purpose of creating a guild able to serve others, but serve his community of trackers and rangers as well. A stalwart champion of the King's, and of a noble house, honor became a major component of the Red Arm. It has since spread to many areas.

## THE LEFT BANK

This troop of rangers is a loosely structured order of hunters, trackers, scouts and rangers. They serve several realms and cities, towns and villages along the left bank of the Great River. They consist of men, dwarves, elves, half-elves, gnomes and halflings. Some work for the lords and mayors, while others hire out as independent contractors and still others serve the region, but know master. They are hard fighting, tough crew of rangers, highly skilled and spend much of their time on the hunt in the wilderlands, watching the enemy that live across the river.

Location: The dwell along the whole length of the Great River, from its mouth to the estuaries. They have common Guild Houses, paid for by the order itself. These are long houses built half into the ground, usually with dirt floors and stout wooden walls and shingled roofs. Some of these are monstrous in size. Here they gather to discuss business and feast.

Guild Structure: The guild is loosely structure with many independent agents. At times they gather in small groups, commanded by one of their own, but usually only for particular reasons, such as scouting for an army etc. They generally pay heed to the more experienced members of their order. Every member is required to pay $10 \%$ of their take in both treasure and payments for maintenance of the guild halls. The halls themselves are served by commoners, but there is always a house lord there.

Local guild house collect tribute from members and use it to maintain the houses and equipment necessary to for the order itself. They also take many donatives from local lords, who desire the Left Bank in the communities.

History: The Great River serves as a boundary between the scattered realms of men and the wilderlands. The wilderlands are home to hosts of obnoxious beasts, bandits, humanoids and other such riff raff dwell. Scouts and adventurers who dared to cross the river began gathering in small groups to work together. In time this groups banded into larger groups and eventually into the guild itself. They are called Bankmen by some.

## LONGSHANKS

The Longshanks are known for their ability to ability to cover a great deal of ground in a short amount of time. They largely consist of humans and half elves, though elves occasionally join their ranks. They have a reputation as being stalwart and trustworthy and are often used as messengers for nobles and their armies. They are noted for their light gear and ability to carve a living out of almost nothing. They also befriend druids frequently and the two work together.

Location: Some Longshanks dwell in small groups of 1-4 in or near a town or village. Most live in the wilds alone, carving

---

a living out of the wilderness. They generally live 20-30 miles apart, creating something of relay stations between larger communities. They have no particular guild halls or meeting houses. When there is need, the one in need sends runners to others and brings them to where they are, or they ask a druid to assist in gathering the order. They meet in some secluded place in the wild to discuss whatever business is pressing.

Guild Structure: They have a very loose guild structure, caring little for the organization of houses and guilds. There are no titles or ranks, just various levels of skill. One Longshanks does not command another, they can only request assistance. They do gather together to defend each other. If one is killed, others frequently group to avenge them.

WEALTH AND INFLUENCE: The Longshanks are highly sought after by nobles, commanders, knights, and other personages for their ability to get information, safely and quickly to their distant holdings. They are trustworthy as well. They are particularly useful when commanders are using large forces on many battlefields. For these reasons, they often have information that others do not. They rarely share this and even then, under only extreme circumstances. Longshanks generally have no personal wealth, having no use for it.

History: The Longshanks formed in response to messengers who formed relays between distant posts. These organized in a loose band to exchange knowledge and craft. From this the ranger order was born.

## THIEF GUILDS

## GRAVEL MONGERS

The Gravel Mongers are a band of human and halfling street toughs, thieves and fighters that hold allegiance to no one. They are extremely violent and brutal in a fight, leaving their hallmark calling card, a fist full of gravel, in any murdered victim's mouth. They are involved in a wide variety of criminal activities from petty theft to racketeering. They control the town's supply of rock and gravel for road and construction.

Location: The Gravel Mongers make their home near the city's gravel pits and construction yards in the run-down part of town. They have dug out a series of rooms and halls underneath the pits and use these as their base of operations. This is where the guild members gather, sleep, rest, sort their booty, and attend all guild functions. There are satellite guilds in the surrounding towns, each run by a Stoneman.

Guild Structure: Joining the guild is relatively easy for anyone from the neighborhood; they must fight their way in. If they survive a fight with another member, they are given provisional status and the rank of Pebble. This is highly dangerous as those that are not welcome are often killed in the introductory fight, sometimes by more than one member. Once granted pebble status they must tribute $75 \%$ of all they take to the Guild. Their tithe decreases over time as they rise in the Guild hierarchy.

| Gravel Mongers Guild Ranking |  |  |  |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Rank/ <br> Level | Title | Tribute | Note |
| 1 | Pebble | $75 \%$ | Pebbles have a <br> high mortality <br> rate. |

| $3-5$ | Slate Dog | $25 \%$ |  |
| $6-9$ | Rock Hound | $15 \%$ |  |

| 12 | The Masons | $5 \%$ | These are <br> the Monger's <br> Guards |
| $13+$ | The Monger | $1 \%$ |  |

Wealth and influence: The Gravel Mongers are not very powerful or wealthy. Their influence is minimal. They often claim control of the gravel pits and a town's stone supply but this is usually bought off, circumvented or causes brutal street fights with the extremely wealthy Stone Masons, which the Gravel Mongers usually lose. They have a high turn-over rate due to Guild deaths. They are, however, highly sought after for their brute force in a street fight.

History: The guild was founded early after the town's first wall went up. The men employed in the gravel pits, mostly criminals or urchins, were horribly beaten, starved and abused. One of their number, once an iron monger, banded them together and in several small street riots established their dominance over the pits. Through a careful balance of bribery, theft, extortion and violence they survived the early attempts to extinguish them, until they became part of the fabric of the town, albeit an extremely unseemly and violent part.

## THE KATE PLAYERS

The Kate Players consist of thieves, of any race, who use bards to distract a crowd with song or dance, while they pickpocket the crowd. A player (bard) begins their music in a public place, usually with a hat or bowl out for donations, while a Kate (a pickpocket) roams the crowd. They are not a particularly violent band, concentrating on picking pockets and cutting purses.

Location: The Players are found in most large towns, and frequent every neighborhood, tavern, inn, bar, or marketplace. They always use a decent, nondescript house in a good neighborhood as their base of operations. Their members dress to blend into their surroundings, never standing out as street urchins, nor as dandy's.

Guild Structure: The guild has a very loose structure, usually based in the town they are occupying. They are led by a Grand Commander and his Directors. Thieves petition for membership, usually paying a heavy tribute of 50 gp to become a Stage Hand. Once in they are apprenticed to another thief, usually an Usher. They advance through skill and stipends, buying their way to the

---

top. The Grand Commander is chosen from the Directors, who in turn are chosen from the Actors. They often communicate with other Kate Players in other towns, keeping tabs on bards who skip out on their pay, etc. But there are no attempts at any higher Guild Order.

| $11-12$ | Director | $0 \%$ |  |
| 13 | Grand <br> Commander | $0 \%$ | Always chosen <br> from the <br> Directors |

Wealth and influence: The Kate Players have a tremendous amount of influence over local bards and their guilds because they offer to front money to these traveling musicians. The loans are done at exorbitant interest rates and finders fees. Among their services are finding suitable engagements for the bards, housing them, buying or replacing their instruments and meeting their other financial needs. Those bards who fail to earn money and pay back the debt are left at the mercy of the Kate Players and forced to earn their payment by setting up engagements in public places and distracting the crowds, even to the point of keeping a thief from discovery or capture. They are given $10 \%$ of the take, which is used to pay back the Kate Players. Many bards die in the service of the Kate Players.

History: The Players first sprang up in the larger royal towns where there were many down and out bards and plenty of audiences for them. A loose confederation of thieves used the bards to gather crowds and eventually organized themselves. The practice soon spread to other towns and villages.

## WHIP JACKS

The Whip Jacks are found in most port communities. They are loose associations of impoverished mariners who make their living by strong armed robbery, burglary, freight theft, and fencing stolen goods. The lion's share of their money comes from the latter as they serve as the middle men for many other thief guilds and possible customers. They are a rough band of fighters and thieves, predominately human, but no mariner is turned away. They are generally careful and attempt to keep a low profile, however their very rough tactics often bring them into conflict with the local authorities.

Location: Their guild halls are always located on the waterfront, usually in a ware house or some storage facility where they can hide stolen goods. The warehouse is always a legitimate business, usually marked by its actual lack of business and very old inventory that never seems to move. In this they hide their stolen wares.

Guild Structure: The Whip Jacks vote on their leadership, the winner earning the title of Captain of the High Seat. A Captain, once chosen, serves until he is killed or until voted out of "his seat". The only way to vote him out is for three separate guild members to call for a vote. If he loses the vote he's kicked out of the seat and a new vote is called. The transitions between one leader and the next are rarely peaceful. New recruits are hazed mercilessly, usually through a series of beatings and whippings. Anyone who cannot handle the punishment is denied entry, and usually killed.

| $2-4$ | Midman | $45 \%$ |
| $5-8$ | Rumjacks | $25 \%$ |
| 9 | Uncle | $0 \%$ |
| $10+$ | Captain of the High Seat | $0 \%$ |

Wealth and influence: The Whip Jacks are usually very influential and powerful, owning a great swath of a town's docks. The harbor masters pay them, ship captains pay them and anyone doing business on the waterfront does as well. All this is protection money to keep the Whip Jacks and others away from their goods. They also buy and sale items, buying stolen goods or loaning money out to the wealthy elite.

History: Much like the Kate Players the Whip Jacks sprang up spontaneously in large port towns. Ex-mariners got together to form groups to protect themselves and from these more organized guilds sprang, eventually spreading to other port tows.

## THE CHOIR

A large, well organized guild of pickpockets, cutpurses, burglars, smugglers, and hijackers. The Choir consists of humans, halfelves, gnomes, and even some humanoids. They are well organized and have a strict hierarchy, and are known for both their finesse and their abject cruelty. People who cross the Choir usually end up on the torturer's rack. They are known for their complicated series of calls, signs and sounds to communicate with each other.

Location: The Choir is found in many towns and cities. Their main guild hall is always built in an inconspicuous neighborhood, usually in the tradesman's neighborhoods. The hall itself is nondescript, but has access to several larger streets and the city's sewers. Branches are set up throughout the town, from the very poor to the very rich. These serve as safe houses for the thieves who people the Choir.

Guild Structure: The Choir is difficult to join and highly structured from the Nippers to the Master. To join one must be recommended to an Upright Man who in turn will test the applicant's skill at cutting purses. If the applicant fails, the test they are cut loose to suffer whatever punishment the city officials mete out. A second attempt to join is not allowed, anyone who attempts to do so is usually murdered.

---

Those members found to possess a certain level of cruelty are given the extra title of Cat Gut. These individuals are mean, enjoy the suffering of others are used as the strong arm of the guild. Anyone with Catgut in their title pays 5\% less tribute.

Upright men aware level and status to the lower orders. A Conductor does the same for levels 7-12. There is only one Conductor of the guild.

| $13+$ | The <br> Conductor | 0 |  |

Wealth and influence: The Choir is extremely powerful with guild halls in many towns. They are territorial, but are careful to allow other guilds to exist in the near proximity, often using them as foils against the powers that be. Their network is huge, and many, great and small, come to the Choir seeking their aid in retrieving items, robbing individuals, staking out highways etc. The Masters and Conductor are often leaders of their communities. They have close ties to the Urban Parkers.

History: The Choir's began when a powerful noble drove cast out a band of children who had formed a choir for his entertainment. Forced to live on the streets the children quickly learned to steal for their daily bread, all the while using their songs to communicate with one another. While one was robbing a store, another would watch and sing out if some threat materialized. Bereft of moral guidance the children developed a mean streak and were not afraid of hurting others to reach their ends.

In time, they matured and the guild did as well, formalizing their ranks and later spreading to other parts of the city. From there
the Choir's influence only grew, carrying over to other towns and villages, until it became one of the most powerful thief guilds in the region.

## LIRBAN PARKERS

The Urban Parkers are a guild of female thieves, cheats, counterfeiters, forgers, kidnappers, pickpockets and swindlers feared by many in power, for their members often live dual lives. Married women, high and low, unmarried women, street urchins, shop keepers, prostitutes, almost any woman or girl of a like mind can be a member of the Urban Parkers.

They are well known for keeping confidence and are often hired to hide people, kidnap children, or swindle goods from someone or some place.

Location: There are no guild houses. The Parkers are divided up into Houses that generally govern towns or neighborhoods. Each house is overseen by a Matron. These women meet when called by the Mother, but never at the same location. These women report to the Committee of 7 , who also meet in a constantly changing location. If a meeting is called the Queen Mother appoints a place. If the whole guild needs to meet for whatever purpose the Queen Mother sends out a summons.

The guild treasure is kept not in any one hall, but is apportioned up by the Committee. $25 \%$ by the Queen Mother and the remaining divided by the other women. In this way the guild is always protected unless the entire Committee were somehow captured or killed.

Guild Structure: The Parkers are governed by a Committee of 7 women, usually Mothers who control towns or regions. These are governed by the Queen Mother who has absolute say over all Guild decisions. The Mothers in turn control their houses and the Matrons theirs. Breaking rank is dangerous and usually gets someone killed. They rarely murder, but call on the Choir, with whom they have close relations, to kill the person in question.

| 13 | Queen <br> Mother | $5 \%$ |  |

---

Wealth and influence: The Urban Parkers possess as much leverage as they do wealth, using their contacts in high and low circles to gain access to all levels of society. They use this leverage to protect themselves and others they deem useful or as close allies. Because they keep themselves removed from murder and more heinous crimes, they are able to peddle this influence with even more acumen. Many turn to them to hide wealth, persons or to have it transported or stolen.

History: The first of the Queen Mothers was a prostitute that tired of the constant beatings and abuse. She set up a series of networks, of women in similar positions, and used them to better her own position. The networks eventually spread throughout the town and the guild was born. To hide it from prying eyes and protect the members (and herself) she established the loose nature of the individual Houses.

## TRADESMEN GUILDS

Tradesmen do not have classes, nor class skills. Below each tradesmen's level is listed in the Guild Ranking Table. For combat purposes consider his level equal to hit dice and allow for 1 d 6 hit points per level.

## GRANITE MEN

The Granite Men consists of the stone masons, rock quarry workers, sculptors, and others employed in the granite or stone working business. Their association is a powerful one and with guild halls in almost every city, town and village. Anywhere a stone mason has learned their profession from another. They are well organized and can be exceedingly violent in protecting their member rights and territory. They are frequently at war with the Gravel Mongers, a Thieves Guild.

Location: In any town of significant size, that has more than 12 Granite Men and at least one Mason, dwell they buy or rent a building where they gather to eat, discuss guild business, administer guild justice, house members or any number of other things that concern the guild. These Guild Houses are located in a more affluent part of town.

Guild Structure: Each Guild House is led by the Mason. A Master Mason commands 4 or more Guild Houses. When large events such as international wars, or wars with other trade guilds occur, the Master Masons meet in a central location to discuss what the guild's position is. Decisions are reached by votes. The decision is not debatable, if anyone in a Guild House refuses to comply they are beaten to death by other members, or at least driven out. Anyone who works in the trade can apply to join. They are accepted regardless of station, so long as they are in the trade.

Most common workers are flakers and will never advance beyond that. Some however, study to become stone masons or sculptors. To do that they must become an apprentice to a Master or a Mason and work their way up the ranks.

Wealth and influence: The Granite Men are powerful, controlling the work and conditions of almost every building project in any town there is. They are well known to fight for their jobs. For example, if a local lord was to hire a bunch of commoners to build his house, they Granite Men would form a brute squad and attack the workers, killing or maiming them. They are constantly at war with other stone mason guilds, independent contractors and the Gravel Mongers.

History: The Granite Men formed as a response to the abuses of many lords who used the Stone Mason for difficult projects for little compensation and a high-risk factor. Their early members were very industrious, traveling between towns to organize themselves into a guild.

## PIG CLEAVERS

A guild of butchers that consists of mostly humans but attracts halflings, gnomes and dwarves. Both men and women in the butcher trade join the guild. They are tough crew who work hard to protect members from outside forces such as thieves guilds seeking protection money, inn keepers who will not pay fair market value, or nobles who undervalue their services. Few cross the Pig Cleavers for they are hard group who are not afraid of blood. They are well armed for most street fights and are known to relish the contest of arms. Many a street has soaked up the blood spilt by the Pig Cleavers.

Location: Their main guild hall, the Slaughterhouse, is in the merchant's district and serves as a meeting hall for all guild business as well as a haven for any member who finds themselves in trouble for any reason. It is solidly built with no outside windows and high walls, making it a virtual fortress in town. Though individual members carry their own cutlery in battle the Slaughterhouse is well supplied with arms and foodstuffs.

Guild Structure: Business is conducted by vote. Every Master Butcher has a vote in guild business. When anything that requires the guild's, attention comes up, a meeting is called and they gather in the Slaughterhouse. There, speakers explain the problem and a vote is called.

| 5 | Master Butcher | $10 \%$ |

Wealth and influence: The Pig Cleavers are a fairly wealthy guild and possess some power in that they control a great deal of the foodstuffs in town. They are also known to be extremely reactive street fighters. The slightest affront can send them tumbling into the street, cleavers and pig stickers in hand, hacking at whoever offended them. However, they collect little in the way of dues, and what they do collect goes toward maintenance of the Staugtherhouse. They have little influence with the nobility in town, few of their members managing to acquire or retain jobs with the nobles.

History: The Pig Cleavers came about during the Spillway War while the town was under siege. Hungry people began attacking shop keepers and butcher shops most of all. The butchers in town gathered together and formed a brotherhood to protect shops and fellow butchers. They have been a pillar of the community ever sense.

## COPPER LECION

A guild of guardsmen that consists of a men and women, humans and demi-humans and even, where called for, humanoids. The guild is open to any who is trained or serves in the capacity of a city guard, night watch, caravan guard, etc. They are known for the copper coin that is riveted to their skull, usually on the side, above the right ear. They are a dangerous guild to cross because their members are well trained and organized and usually able to fight as a unit. They are also referred to as Copperheads.

Location: The Copper Legion have purchased and remodeled an open-air palace as their headquarters, which they call the Armory. There, the central courtyard is used as a training field, the side rooms as barracks and storage for weapons and foodstuffs and the larger halls for eating and dining. The guild leader dwells here, as do several training masters and his lieutenants.

Guild Structure: The Copper Legion are highly militarized, following a simple command structure as noted below. The Consul serves for 1 year and is voted in by the Legates and Tribunes. It should be noted that the guilds command structure is often different than the city watch with whom they serve. But in general Optios are sergeants in the watch, Centurians are Captains and Tribunes are commanders. Anyone who serves as a guard in any capacity can join. They are immediately branded with the riveted coin to the head and introduced to the guild hall.

| 6-7 | Tribune | $10 \%$ |
| 8-9 | Legate | $10 \%$ |
| 10 | Consul |  |

Wealth and influence: The Copper Legion is a powerful guild as they are responsible for the cities protection. Because of this the guild is not particularly liked as its members serve to protect the populace but also work to protect themselves as well. They are often at loggerheads with various factions in town, including nobles and their retainers/guards, City Burghers, other guilds, etc. Much of the guild's wealth is spent on weaponry and training. They always attempt to protect members from being impressed into armies that march into the field, but at times, if the money is good enough, actively sponsor such excursions from their normal duties.

History: The Copper Legion formed some time ago when a guardsman named Holveg was wrongfully arrested and put to death. Once he was vindicated the city burghers did nothing to rectify the wrong and caused a riot. Guardsmen ran rampant for several days and a host of thieves and cutpurses joined them. In the ensuring mayhem, the city attempted to placate them and get them back to their posts. Realizing they had strength in numbers the guardsmen organized, marking themselves with copper coins riveted to their heads.

## SAWBONES CLUB

A guild of doctors, surgeons, herbalists, and dentists the sawbones consist of all manner of people in the medical profession. They are highly organized and follow a strict set of rules. Though they do not command the muscle many of the other guilds do, in both numbers and brute strength, they walk the center line as most everyone will be in need of the services of a Sawbones. For this reason, they are treated carefully by people, guilds, nobles and generally everyone. They fix prices for services as well.

Location: The Sawbones meet in a small fortified palace, the Boneward House, on the edge of the noble's quarter. The walls are high and guarded by several towers. Access is gained by one central gate that requires a password. Within the palace is laid out like a military barracks, allowing members to live there in comfort and safely. The Sawbones use it in time of siege or riots. It is always well stocked with provisions. The Boneward House is always protected by 20 mercenary guardsmen who are housed in the House.

Guild Structure: The guild is run by a council of three who are chosen for 2 year terms by guild members. Every member is allowed a vote for the councilmen. Guild business is conducted in a public forum in the Boneward House, and guild members can

---

participate. Serious decisions are put to a common vote. If four guild members call for a vote of no confidence for a councilmen and immediate election is held. Joining the Sawbones requires a tribute of 25 gp and an elaborate initiation process that involves various tests to determine the candidate's capabilities.

**This includes anyone who was a councilmember.
Wealth and influence: The Sawbones Club is very influential as members are sought after by all classes of people for simple ailments to devastating wounds. They are well paid and use their money to maintain the Club's strength, the Boneward House, and to keep it well armed. They have enough money accumulated to hire a small army for some time.

History: The Sawbones organized only late in the town's history when others began to take their services for granted. Many began to see doctors in an evil light, living unhealthy or dangerous lives, these patients turned to the doctors to cure them of their woes. When the doctors failed to do this, the doctors were abused for it and cast as societies' pariah. Those in the profession revolted at this concept and organized. The guild works hard to cleanse bad members, set price controls, and discredit troublesome or whiney patients.

## SCRIVENER GUILD

The scriveners are a collection of human, elf, and gnome scribes who offer their services in most towns and cities. Some travel with caravans as permanent record keepers. They work for noble houses and merchant houses. Some are hired by adventurers and other travelers to log their exploits in the annals of history. They are versed in several writing styles form the complex to the simple. They are not particularly educated, though many possess a greater than normal knowledge of regional history, information they have gathered over time.

Location: The Scriveners Guild sets up shop in town by purchasing or renting a small house, set in a quiet neighborhood. The guild house is usually well kept, clean, and possesses a sign of ink bottle and feathered quill on it. The opening rooms are for customers who come seeking a scribe. The back or upper rooms are for the scribes themselves. Here they keep supplies for guild members to purchase at discounted prices, gather for meetings,
feasts and celebrations or entertain guests of the guild. There are always one or two scribes living at the Guild House.

Guild Structure: The Scriveners Guild has little structure. Members are not beholden to each other or to the guild itself. They gain its benefits through discounted prices, price controls, protection if necessary, job placement, etc. The most powerful, if such a word applies, of the scribes are those in the guild house. These manage jobs and payments. They negotiate with all parties seeking a scribe or set pay rates for those in permanent employ. These are usually older scribes whose abilities have failed through arthritis or some other ailment. They are often bribed or attended to by other scribes to help grease the way to new jobs.

All guild members take oaths of confidentiality, that, if broken, are punished by death by stoning.

No scribe who is a member of the guild takes a job that is not recommended by the Scriveners Guild. People looking to employ a scribe are always directed to the guild house where prices are negotiated to assure that the scribe in question does not have to partake in the ugly business of negotiation. A scribe will send someone seeking to employ them to the guild house to negotiate prices and payments before taking the job.

Very old scribes are always given homes to live in upon retirement, usually small houses or rented spaces. These Venerable Masters no longer work through choice or happenstance, unless there is some special circumstance.

Wealth and influence: The Scriveners Guild is very powerful as their members work for all classes of society, from the rich to the poor and they are party to all manner of information. The guild itself makes certain their members are well paid and taken care of; abuses by an employer are not tolerated and allow one to get black balled quickly, an action that can be devastating to a local organization or government.

History: Scribes have served the great house for years, but when they realized that some were well paid, others not so much and still others abused and beaten, that they began to organize. Slowly at first, various scribes communicated through letters to build a loose association. In time this became a powerful guild, spreading from town to city.

## WIZARD AND ILLUSIONIST ORDERS

## THE AMBIT GUILD

A guild of wizards, witches, illusionists and sorcerers that is represented in all the kingdoms of men. It primarily consists of humans, but some demi-humans occupy its ranks. The Font is well known as their members are aggressive practitioners of their craft. They serve both the guild's needs, as well as their own. They are common members of adventuring parties and as such are found in every hole, mountain, forest and river bank in the world. They do not commonly hire themselves out to nobles or others, as their primary task is the acquisition of power as contained in the Guild.

Location: The Ambit Guild is located on the physical plane and a pocket dimension. Designed like a six spoked wheel the Guild House contains a number of rooms for members to live in as well as an extensive library, any number of cells devoted to the study of magic as well as apothecaries, brewing rooms, etc. Member pay their dues and dwell in the Guild House or on their own as they choose. The Guild House always has open rooms for traveling wizards to find comfort, despite their condition. The Guild House is also kept in a pocket dimension, accessed by members via rope trick spells. Here the real power and wealth of the guild is hidden.

Guild Structure: The Ambit has an extremely loose structure where members are governed by their own conscience. They tribute $10-20 \%$ of their income, depending on how much they can afford. A Grand Council of the Magi oversees the Guild House, its maintenance and members and their activities, but possess little in the way of governing authority. Knowledge is their primary goal and keeping it safe in the pocket dimension Guild House their goal.

| $1-9$ | Travelers | Those who seek out <br> knowledge |
| $1-9$ | Keepers | Those who catalog and <br> study the knowledge |
| $10+$ | Grand Council <br> Member |  |

Wealth and influence: Vast stores of wealth, both magical and mundane, are kept at the primary guild hall and with their members. Because of their reluctance to interact with local government, coupled with their accumulation of knowledge and power, they are often at odds with others. Generally distrusted, few turn to them for aid, unless it is for a singular reason. They attempt to steer clear of all local entanglements and problems.

History: An Ambit refers to a compass, and the guild is named after it for they seek knowledge at all points of the compass. They were first formed man years ago, when several wandering wizards met on the road and exchanged news of their
discoveries. They struck up a friendship and a loose affiliation after that. The guild grew out of that exchange.

## CULT OF MERITHUL

The Cult is a band of wizards dedicated to the collection and mastery of secret knowledge and sorcery, things hidden from the world by the ancients. They come from all walks of life, high and low, all races of men and demi-humans. They are noted by their tattoos of geometric designs that band their forearms. They are known as subtle practitioners of the sorcerous art, drawing little attention to themselves through their deeds, for this reason few know of their existence and almost never seek them out. They are fiercely loyal to one another.

Location: There is no central guild hall. Each member has their own domicile where they build a base of power. Their homes are towers, keeps, castles, palaces, houses, cottages or whatever the individual desires. They communicate via magical means, whether a spell or item is up to the individual. Many of members keep their locations hidden, even from their fellows, to protect both themselves and their compatriots from magical disasters. New members are inducted by another member, but must be approved before knowledge of the Cult is handed to the new applicant. They in turn create a base from which they begin building their own pools of knowledge.

Guild Structure: The cult's structure is based on experience and respect. Wizards are generally intelligent individuals, and cult members are no different. They can discern qualities of leadership in their own ranks, even those who may not be entirely self-aware. Those who earn the admiration of their comrades are the cult leaders. The greatest of these assumes the title of Arch Mage. Others are titled appropriately. There are no dues. Members take care of their own needs.

Wealth and influence: The Cult has no accumulated wealth, and very little in the way of influence. The guild is secretive and its members do not seek out power or influence. They are

---

known by a few and are called upon from time to time when in need of secret knowledge.

History: The Cult came together when several powerful wizards banded together to seek out the power of the ancients. Failing this they set themselves to the task of working together, albeit secretly to bring about the guild's ultimate goal. This has been largely abandoned in the later years as new members seek ever different knowledge.

## THE WARDENS OF ELKHORN

A conclave of powerful wizards known for their deep knowledge in all things arcane, from travel upon the plains to battling the undead. The guild largely consists of humans, though some few demi-humans make their way into the ranks of the Wardens. They are well known and called upon frequently, though they use their power carefully, reserving it for those tasks they set themselves and those select personages with whom they possess a personal connection, or find deserving. Their reclusiveness does not come from arrogance of power, but rather the knowledge that many who seek it will abuse it, or at least fail to use it properly.

Location: The Guild House of the Wardens is located on a hill just outside the walls of the old town of Elkhorn. Here a huge wooden manor serves the guild as a meeting hall and laboratory. Rooms are set aside for guild members and visitors. A great hall serves as chamber to feast, entertain and for ceremonies. It is a sprawling complex with an extensive underground where are set a host of shops, halls, and rooms devoted to the craft.

Guild Structure: The Wardens are highly structured, led by an Arch Mage, a Council and a Senate. To join it a member must recommend a candidate and the candidate pass a series of competency tests. The members advance in rank only after extensive testing by three other higher ranking guild members. All members are given a vote in the Senate and these choose Council Members. The leader of the Wardens remains the founder, the Arch Mage Jamemsward.

Wealth and influence: Long ages have given the Wardens a tremendous power. Their physical wealth in worldly treasures is large enough, but their connections to many of the kings and princes of the world, as well as men of common stature has given them access to halls great and small. Few are the places that a Warden cannot find friends. But their real wealth lies in the unfathomable knowledge of the arcane arts.

History: Many years past a young mage in the small town of Elkhorn made a name for himself with his skill in the magical arts. He cut his teeth in the deep dungeons of ancient beasts seeking adventure, fame, power and wealth. In time, his abilities set him apart from other magi and his power was matched by few. As the years passed a desire to devote himself to the conquest of knowledge overrode his lust for battle and plunder. His hometown of Elkhorn had grown in the many years since his youth and he returned to his roots. He founded the Wardens of Elkhorn, a guild of like-minded adventurers. He carefully selecting young wizards to serve in his order. In time it grew until the wizards were a force from the frozen north to the seas of the distant south.

## THE SCINTILLANT DAWN

A guild of wizards who practice magic that focuses on fire, heat, and motion. The guild is large and includes many peoples of diverse backgrounds, and they are well represented throughout the human and demi-human realms. The guild has a reputation for evil, though this is not true. There have of course been evil members in the Scintillant Dawn, but by and large they are a neutral guild. Their reputation comes from the nature of their magic which can be highly destructive, though they argue that they are exercising control only. Heat is a fundamental part of motion, and all things must be moved to greater deeds or they languish in the shadow of what could have been. They are often called the Unclouded and are forever at war with the Wintertide Guild.

Location: The Unclouded have guild halls everywhere. These range from the small to the large, but are always made of stone house with slate shingle roofs. The guild halls, called Halls of Fire, offer members places to live, study, practice, test and interact with others. An audience chamber exists in them all, where people can come to hire the guild or one of its members for any number of magical tasks. The Halls of Fire are usually built with defense in mind, from both the magical and the mundane.

Guild Structure: The guild is highly structured, from the top to the bottom. Applicants must petition for entry at one of the guild houses, once accepted they are assigned 3-8 years of duty (depending on age) in the Hall of Fire before being given to another as an apprentice. Moving up through the ranks is done by experience and rigorous tests which must show the master of certain spells. Apprentices are awarded a spell book with four spells. Each rank attained in the guild is rewarded with one spell added to their book. At the highest levels the guild has an Arch Mage who presides over a council. These usually meet on a metaphysical planes to discuss club business. Every member must give $25 \%$ of their income to the guild.

Scintillant Dawn Guild Ranking

Wealth and influence: The Scintillant Dawn is powerful, with guild houses everywhere. Their members serve kings and princes, merchants and their houses, people, communities, and themselves. But the loyalty of the Unclouded is never in doubt, it lies with the guild. Monies flood the guild's coffer from tribute made by their guild members, payments made by those seeking the guild's help and other means both nefarious and above the board.

History: Many years past a large guild, the Order of the Celestial Tapestry, was known far and wide. Its members were highly respected magi that served a variety of purposes. But the guild split into factions over dogma and the practice of magic. Eventually the factions broke the guild apart, many leaving entirely to forge their own path. But the two most powerful formed rival guilds, the Scintillant Dawn, or the Unclouded, and the Wintertide, or the Gloaming. Their rivalry eventually came to blows and the two guilds have been at war as long as can be remembered.

## WINTERTIDE GUILD

The guild of wizards that practice magic that focus on ice, cold and binding magic. The guild is large, though not so large as the Scintillant Dawn. It consists of many wizards from all walks of life and races of humans and demi-humans. They guild is seen by many as evil and its reputation is somewhat deserved for they believe that the world is filled with chaos, represented by how it embraces the destructive powers of fire. The Wintertide Guild believes that peace is found in control of others, in dampening the fires of desire and locking them in the cold embrace of winter. Ice is the binding agent, and all things must be held for the greater good, for if not guided by the invisible hand, they cause chaos and pain. They are often referred to as the Gloaming and they are forever at war with the Scintillant Dawn.

Location: The Wintertide Guild has houses in many towns and cities. They are less common in small burgs for few welcome
them. In large population centers their towers are easily forgotten. The Wintertide guild house is a tower of stone surrounded by a low wall. They all possess large dungeons underneath. The tower itself is small, a hundred feet tall and serves more as an entry point. They are always lavishly decorated. Beneath, in the dungeons are hosts of room for the members to meet, practice their craft and conduct guild business.

Guild Structure: The guild is structured much like a feudal kingdom, with the Arch Mage ruling all beneath him and delegating powers and responsibilities. Each tower is given rule of its own members and the master of each tower is called Lord of the Tower. They are answerable to the Arch Mage. Joining the guild is not easy, as they generally seek out applicants who have magical abilities; these can be from other guilds or wholly unknown. There is no tribute but donatives are encouraged and the guild thrives upon it, for members can buy status from the Arch Mage.

| 9 | High Mage |

| $13+$ | Arch Mage |

Wealth and influence: The Wintertide Guild has little influence with common people and not much more with the nobles and merchants. They guild is generally closed off from normal society, but members do occasionally join the service of some lord or other. They are inward facing and explore magic on their own terms. They have a vast fortune however as members pay donatives to gain rank and station. Their repository of magic is extraordinary as well.

Guilds and Orders is a simple resource guide for use at almost any table and any roleplaying game. It lists several dozen possible guilds or orders that you can port into your game and use to augment an adventure through role playing. It's a book that adds depth to a region by giving its people that much more flavor. Below you'll find outlined scores of guilds and orders, that serve as ready to play creations or as examples of what they should look like.
There are entries from the commonly known thieves' guild to the less remembered trade guilds. Whatever the listing, there is more than enough fodder for everyone.
