## ON THE COVER

Kerem Beyit illustrates a lonely ranger casting a spell while she finds a troll footstep on the forest ground after several weeks of tracking and searching the creature.

Disclaimer: I'm not responsible for the consequences of trying to hunt down an ancient red dragon without proper equipment. Some side effects by creating a healing potion using strange materials may include hallucinations, paranoia, sudden changes in behavior and glowing cyes.

# Part 1: Collecting Materials 

UOU CAN COLLECT MATERIALS DURING your travels, which are used to craft new equipment, create alchemical concoctions and gemstones. To get new materials, you must expend the whole process without major interruptions (like a combat). There're three material categories, and each one has a special way to collect them: Creatures, Minerals and others and Plants and herbs.

Also, depending of the type of material and the place where it is, they might be modifiers to the skill check made for collecting the materials. The DM can add more than one of the modifiers (for example, if you're traveling at normal pace in a rainy day, the DC will be +11 ).

## Special conditions

Rain, fog, low visibility areas
Storm, snowfall, no visibility areas
Traveling at slow pace
Traveling at normal pace
Traveling at fast pace

## Material Sourges

## Creatures

Creature parts are used as alchemical materials and for creating armor and weapons for the adventurers, which some of them gives special features. Others take some of the creature parts as trophies and decorations for their armor and houses.

If you want to extract parts of animals and creatures, you must make an Intelligence (Nature) check for common creatures, Intelligence (Arcana) or an Intelligence (Religion) check for rarer creatures. You can also make a Wisdom (Survival) instead an Intelligence check when harvesting parts. On a failed check, the part is destroyed or damaged. It's up to the DM to determine which check is made depending on the creature type and how common is that creature in the world.

DC: $\mathbf{1 5 + 1 / 2}$ of the creature's CR (Creatures with a CR less than 2 don't add the $C R$ to the $D C$ )

The number of checks you can make and the time used for harvesting all the parts of a creature depends of the size of the creature as shown in the following table. For example, if you harvest a medium sized creature it will take one hour for the whole process, even if you only make 1 check.

## Creature Size Max. harvest checks Total time to harvest

| Tiny | 1 | Two hours |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Small | 1 | 30 minutes |
| Medium | 2 | One hour |
| Large | 3 | One hour |
| Huge | 4 | Two hours |
| Gargantuan | 5 | Two hours (minimum) |

Each successful check gives you a number of units depending on the creature size as shown in the following table, which can be used for creating new pieces of equipment or as alchemical materials.

Creature size Units collected per check

| Tiny | $1 / 4$ unit |
| :-- | :-- |
| Small | $1 / 2$ unit |
| Medium | 1 unit |
| Large | 2 units |
| Huge | 3 units |
| Gargantuan | 4 units |

You can only make one check for each part you want to harvest. For example, a character can make 3 checks for harvesting a large sized dragon, but he can only use one of the checks to harvest the scales, and the other two checks can be used for other parts of the dragon (like an essential organ and the horns)

For alchemical uses, the DM determines the essence type of the harvested parts. You can read more information about the essences in the alchemy section.

When you use the parts for crafting armors and weapons, you need a number of units of the same material depending of the size for the object. You can read more about crafting and the materials in the crafting section.

---

In the following table are examples of creature parts and their uses. Some parts deals damage if you fail to extract it. The elemental damage can be any type of damage, and it's defined by the DM (for example, a character takes fire damage on a failed check to extract the essential organ of a red dragon). You can determine the damage using the same guidelines for traps damage found in the chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide.

| Part | Uses | Damage on a failure |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Sting | Alchemy, equipment | Deals poison damage on a failed check |
| Wings, feathers | Alchemy, equipment | — |
| Fins | Alchemy, equipment | — |
| Chitin | Equipment | — |
| Tail | Alchemy | — |
| Fangs, teeth | Alchemy, equipment | Deals piercing damage on a failed check |
| Organ | Alchemy | — |
| Horns | Equipment | Deals piercing damage on a failed check |
| Ectoplasm | Alchemy | Deals necrotic damage on a failed check |
| Scales | Alchemy, equipment | — |
| Elemental essence | Alchemy | Deals elemental damage on a failed check |
| Claws | Alchemy, equipment | Deals slashing damage on a failed check |
| Bones | Alchemy, equipment | — |
| Slime, mucus | Alchemy | Deals elemental or poison damage on a failed check |
| Essential Organ | Alchemy | Deals elemental damage on a failed check |
| Fur, hide | Equipment | — |
| Blood | Alchemy | — |

## Parts Values

The value of each harvested unit goes from $1 \%$ to $50 \%$ of the experience of the creature. The harvested parts of common creatures have a value of $1 \%$ of the creature's experience, while the rarer creature's parts value is close to $50 \%$ of the creature's experience. You can determine the values of each extracted part in the following table.

## Units Value

| CR | Creature rarity | Unit value |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 6 or less | Common | $1 \%$ of the creature exp. |
| $7-12$ | Uncommon | $5 \%$ of the creature exp. |
| $13-18$ | Rare | $10 \%$ of the creature exp. |
| $19-24$ | Very Rare | $25 \%$ of the creature exp. |
| $25+$ | Legendary | $50 \%$ of the creature exp. |

For example, if you harvest some feathers from a hippogriff (CR 1), the value of the feather unit will be $1 \%$ of the base experience ( 200 exp ), which is 2 gp .

As other examples: A unit of pseudodragon's scales is worth $5 \mathrm{sp}(\mathrm{CR} 1 / 4)$, and a unit of an adult blue dragon's scales is worth $1,500 \mathrm{gp}$ (CR 16).

## Getting Meat (Foraging Variant)

While the characters can forage to survive on the wilderness, they also can hunt down and kill a creature to harvest the meat and use it as food. The meat they yield spoils after a single day if uneaten. Eating spoiled meat might require a Constitution saving throw to avoid throwing up the food or getting diseased.

A character can make a Wisdom (Survival) check to try to collect meat as food. The DC for the check is typically 15 , but it's up to the DM to modify the DC. The amount of meat harvested is determined by the creature size, as shown in the creature food yield table below.

Getting meat does not count on the maximum harvest checks you can make to harvest a creature.

## Creature Food Yield

Creature Size Food Gained

| Tiny | 1 lb . |
| :-- | :-- |
| Small | 4 lb . |
| Medium | 16 lb . |
| Large | 32 lb . |

## Minerals and Others

Minerals are earthen materials used for making armor, weapons, and gaining special effects for those armors and weapons. Minerals can be divided in two types and each type has a unique way to acquire them.

- Ores are extracted with the use of a Miner's Pick and a Strength (athletics) check.
- Gemstones are extracted with the use of Gem Extraction Tools (worth 25 gp ) and Dexterity check.

The check for extracting either mineral type is always DC 15. If needed, the character must make an Intelligence (Nature) check first to find a vein or a place where the ores or gemstones are.

- If the character is extracting ores, on a success they collects a number of ore units equal to $2 \mathrm{~d} 4+$ your Constitution modifier.
- If the character is extracting gemstones, the DM determines the amount of the gemstones found, or he can roll a d20 and compare the result with the following table. You can determine the kind of gemstones found using the tables in the page 134 of the Dungeon Master's Guide.

| d20 | Gemstones found |
| :-- | :-- |
| $1-15$ | 1 gemstone $(10 \mathrm{gp})$ |
| $16-17$ | 1 d 4 gemstones $(10 \mathrm{gp})$ |
| 18 | 1 gemstone $(50 \mathrm{gp})$ |
| 19 | 1 d 4 gemstones $(50 \mathrm{gp})$ |
| 20 | Roll twice |

---

# NON-MINERAL MATERIALS 

There're also other materials which are not ores or gemstones, such as wood, stone and coral that can be also used to craft weapons or pieces of armor.

For collecting those materials, you need to make a Strength (Athletics) or a Dexterity check, depending on the material (DC 15). On a success you collect a number of units equal to $2 \mathrm{~d} 4+$ your Constitution modifier. For example, if a character wants to collect some units of darkwood for an armor, he must make a Strength (Athletics) check to cut down the tree with an axe and get the material. On a success, he collects a number of Darkwood units equals to $2 \mathrm{~d} 4+$ his Constitution modifier.

The time used for extracting minerals and other materials equals to 1 day of downtime activity. This represents all the time the character uses to find and extract the materials.

## Materials Values

Minerals and other materials can be sold (and in some cases, bought), and the value of each unit depends of the material. For more information see the crafting section.

## Plants and Herbs

Plants are used for creating alchemical potions and mixtures, and they are divided in four levels of rarity.

- Common plants, which have one essence
- Uncommon plants, which have two different essences
- Rare plants, which have two essences of the same type
- Very Rare plants, which have two essences of the same type and one extra essence

To gather plants, herbs and other similar resources the character must make an Intelligence (Nature) check (DC 15).

If the character success the check, the DM rolls a d20 to determine the number of resources gathered.

| d20 | Number of plants gathered |
| :-- | :-- |
| $1-10$ | 1 |
| $11-15$ | $1 d 4$ |
| $16-18$ | $1 d 4+1$ |
| 19 | $1 d 4+2$ |
| 20 | Roll twice |

The time used for gathering equals to 1 hour for each check, and you can make a number of checks per day equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1).

## Plants Values

You can buy and sell the plants and herbs in the market as shown in the following table.

| Plant Rarity | Market Value |
| :-- | :-- |
| Common | 5 gp |
| Uncommon | 10 gp |
| Rare | 20 gp |
| Very Rare | 40 gp |

# Part 2: Alchemy 

![img-1.jpeg](assets/Wilderness%20Survival%20Guide%20-%20The%20Homebrewery_img-1.jpeg)

ACH INGREDIENT USED IN ALCHEMY has one or more essences which are extracted and used to create mixtures with alchemical properties: Water (6), Air ( $\boldsymbol{\sim}$ ), Fire ( $\boldsymbol{\sim}$ ), Earth ( $\boldsymbol{\Delta}$ ), Positive ( $\boldsymbol{\pi}$ ) and Negative (C)

## AlGHEMY BASICS

- You can create bombs, poisons and potions using up to six ingredients to craft them.
- The ingredients are any resource which have one or more essences you use to create the mixture (such as blue herbs or a Mandrake root).
- You need a glass bottle worth 2 gp for each bomb or potion you craft.
- If a bomb or poison requires a saving throw, the DC equals $8+$ your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.
- The value of bombs, poisons and potions equals to 10 points for the first ingredient plus 15 points for each extra ingredient after the first. Mixtures which have a value of 25 points or less can be crafted anywhere, while a mixture with more than 25 points will require a place and the required tools for crafting due the complexity of the concoction and the amount of ingredients.


## Creating a Mixture

Follow this steps to creating a mixture.

1. After determining the number of ingredients and the value of the mixture, the character must declare if it's creating a bomb, poison or potion.
2. Then, it must distribute the essences to choose the effects for the mixture at the beginning of the creation process. Any unused essences are lost.
3. The creation process must be made in sessions of 4 uninterrupted hours for each 25 points of the mixture you're trying to create. When you start the first session, all ingredients are consumed.
4. At the end of the last session, the character must make an Intelligence check, adding the proficiency bonus if he's proficient with the artisan's tools related to the mixture created: alchemist's supplies for bombs, poisoner's kit for poisons and herbalism kit for potions. The DC for the check is $6+$ twice the number of ingredients used. If the character passes the check, the mixture is created. On a fail, the mixture is not created and all the ingredients are lost.

## BOMBS

Bombs are throwable alchemical concoctions, and when the vial is shattered it releases its content. As an action, you can throw a bomb to a location you can see up to 30 feet from you.

## Bomb Creation Notes

- When creating a bomb, you can only choose one damaging effect, which are detailed in the Damage Effect table. If you add the same effect two times or more, the area of effect and damage stacks. For example, you cannot create a bomb that deals fire and necrotic damage, but you can make a bomb with 6 fire essences which deals 3d6 fire damage in a 15 -foot radius.
- Additionally, you can add only one extra bomb effect to the bombs you create, which are detailed in the Additional Bomb Effects table.


## Damage Effect

Combination Effect

| $\boldsymbol{\lambda}+\boldsymbol{\Delta}$ | All creatures in a 5 -foot radius must make a Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 acid damage. |
| :--: | :--: |
| $+$ | All creatures in a 5 -foot radius must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 cold damage. |
| $\boldsymbol{\lambda}+\boldsymbol{\lambda}$ | All creatures in a 5 -foot radius must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 fire damage. |
| $\boldsymbol{\text { 3 }}+\boldsymbol{\lambda}$ | All creatures in a 5 -foot radius must make a Intelligence saving throw or take 1d6 force damage. |
| $\boldsymbol{\text { 3 }}+\boldsymbol{\text { 3 }}$ | All creatures in a 5 -foot radius must make a Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 lightning damage. |
| $\boldsymbol{C}+\boldsymbol{C}$ | All creatures in a 5 -foot radius must make a Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 necrotic damage. |
| $\boldsymbol{\Delta}+\boldsymbol{\Delta}$ | All creatures in a 5 -foot radius must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 piercing damage. |
| $*+*$ | All creatures in a 5 -foot radius must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 radiant damage. |
| $\boldsymbol{\text { 3 }}+\boldsymbol{*}$ | All creatures in a 5 -foot radius must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 thunder damage. |

---

## Additional Bomb Effects

## Combination Effect

On a failed save, the targets are also covered with a sticky gel. Any effect that deals damage damage to them while covered in the gel occurs again at the start of each of their turns for 1d4 rounds. A creature can remove the gel spending its action.

The bomb releases slippery oil on the ground in the area that last for 1 minute. Any creature that start its turn in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.

A bright light explosion is released when the bomb explodes. All creatures must make a Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1d4 turns.

The bomb emits a loud sound, which can be heard 100 feet away. All creatures in the bomb area must make a Constitution saving throw or be deafened for 1 d 4 turns.

A dense fog appears in the area, blocking the vision for 1 d 4 turns.

## Poisons

Poisons are substances that cause disturbances in living creatures. The effect depends on the poison used.

## Poison Greation Notes

- Poisons come in the following four types: contact, ingested, inhaled or injury. When creating a poison, you must choose one of them.
- A creature must make a Constitution saving throw for resisting a poison.
- When creating a poison, you can only choose one effect, which are detailed in the Poison Effect table.
- You can add any number of extra properties to the poisons you create, which are detailed in the Additional Poison Properties.


## Poison Types

Contact: Contact poison can be smeared on an object and remains potent until it is touched or washed off. A creature that touches contact poison with exposed skin suffers its effects.
Ingested: A creature must swallow an entire dose of ingested poison to suffer its effects. The dose can be delivered in food or a liquid. You may decide that a partial dose has a reduced effect, such as allowing advantage on the saving throw or dealing only half damage on a failed save.
Inhaled: These poisons are powders or gases that take effect when inhaled. Blowing the powder or releasing the gas subjects creatures in a 5 -foot cube to its effect. The resulting cloud dissipates immediately afterward. Holding one's breath is ineffective against inhaled poisons, as they affect nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body.
Injury: Injury poison can be applied to Weapons, ammunition, trap Components, and other Objects that deal piercing or slashing damage and remains potent until delivered through a wound or washed off. A creature that takes piercing or slashing damage from an object coated with the poison is exposed to its effects.

## Poison Effect

## Combination Effect

$\boldsymbol{\Delta}+\boldsymbol{\Delta}$
On a failed save, the creature is poisoned for 1 minute.

- $+\boldsymbol{C}$

On a failed save, the creature is blinded for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
$\boldsymbol{\Delta}+\rightleftharpoons$ On a failed save, the creature is incapacitated for 1 minute and spends the duration screaming, laughing, or weeping.
$\Delta+\rightleftharpoons$ On a failed save, the creature becomes frightened for 1 minute and must use his or her action and movement each round to flee from the source of the fear, which is the creature or object it see.
$\Delta+\boldsymbol{C} \quad$ On a failed save, the creature begins babbling and is incapable of normal Speech or spellcasting for 1 minute.
$\Delta+\boldsymbol{C} \quad$ On a failed save, the creature is paralyzed for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
$\Delta+\Delta$ On a failed save, the creature is stunned for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
$C+C$
On a failed save, the creature is unconscious for 1 minute. The creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake.

---

## Additional PoISON Properties

## Combination Effect

On a failed save, the creature takes 1d6 poison damage.

- The poison takes effect 1 minute after the creature was exposed. If you take this property more than once, the the poison takes effect in 1 hour ( 3 times), 8 hours ( 4 times) or 24 hours ( 5 times)
- The effect last for 10 minutes. If you take this property more than once, the duration of the poison increases to 1 hour ( 3 times), 8 hours ( 4 times) or 24 hours ( 5 times)
*     - The poison looks like a potion. A creature can make an Intelligence (Investigation) check to reveal its true nature.


## Potions

Potions are mixtures created to give benefits to anyone who drinks it. The effects depends on the potion used.

## Potion Creation Notes

- When creating a potion, you can only choose one effect, which are detailed in the Potion Effect table. If you add the same effect two times or more, the effect and time stacks. For example, if you make a potion with 6 water essences it will heal $3 \mathrm{~d} 4+3$ hit points, and if you make a potion with 3 earth essences and 3 negative essences it will grant resistance against slashing damage for 3 minutes.
- You can only be under the effects of one potion that has a duration, and drinking a new potion will replace the previous effect.


## Potion Effect

## Combination Effect

The potion heals heals $1 \mathrm{~d} 4+1$ hit points.
You have resistance to bludgeoning damage for 1 minute.
You have resistance to piercing damage for 1 minute.

- You have resistance to slashing damage for 1 minute.
- You have resistance to cold damage for 1 minute.
- You have resistance to fire damage for 1 minute.
- You have resistance to lightning damage for 1 minute.
- You can breathe in places without oxygen for 10 minutes.

# Part 3: Crafting 

![img-2.jpeg](assets/Wilderness%20Survival%20Guide%20-%20The%20Homebrewery_img-2.jpeg)

URING YOUR ADVENTURES AND TRAVELS, you can collect a series of elements and materials to craft special equipment. This section expands the crafting system found in the Player's Handbook and modifies some parts of it.

You can craft nonmagical objects, including adventuring equipment. You must be proficient with tools related to the object you are trying to create (typically artisan's tools). You might also need access to special locations to create it. For example, someone proficient with smith's tools needs a forge in order to craft a sword or suit of armor.

For every day of downtime you spend crafting, you can craft one or more items with a total market value not exceeding 25 gp , and you must expend raw materials worth half the total market value. If something you want to craft has a market value greater than 25 gp , you make progress every day in 25 gp increments until you reach the market value of the item. For example, a suit of plate armor (market value of $1,500 \mathrm{gp}$ ) takes 60 days to craft by you.

Multiple characters can combine their efforts toward the crafting of single item, provided that the characters all have proficiency with the requisite tools and are working together in the same place. Each character contributes 25 gp worth of effort for every day spent helping to craft the item. For example, three characters with the requisite tool proficiency and the proper facilities can craft a suit of plate armor in 20 days, at a total cost of 750 gp .

While crafting, you can maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day, or a comfortable lifestyle at half the normal cost (see chapter 5 of the Player's Handbook for more information on lifestyle expenses).

## Object Types

There're three types of objects you can craft:
Common objects are the objects you can easily find in a store, dungeons and most of the artisans makes them regularly, like a longsword or a leather armor.

Special objects are the pieces of equipment crafted with special materials, like a darksteel longsword.

Unique objects are completely new creations, with custom forms, qualities and benefits, like a greatsword with a mechanism to transform it in two scimitars.

## Skill Checks

When you craft an object, you must make a skill check at the end of the process to see if you succeed on the creation of the object. The skill check has the following rules:

- You need to make an Ability check (d20 + ability modifier)
- You can add the proficiency bonus if you are proficient with the artisan tools you need.
- If you are in a place without the tools needed or you dont have the artisan tools, the check is made with disadvantage and without your proficiency bonus.

DC for crafting objects: Normal objects: 10; Special objects: 15; Unique objects: 20.

If you fail the check, you must finish a long rest to make the check again. After 3 consecutive failures, you need to start the process again and all the materials you used are lost.

## Hiring Artisans

You can hire one or more artisans to help you creating the object or to create the object completely by themselves. When using special materials, you need to hire an artisan which knows how to work that material.

The cost for hiring an artisan depends of the object type you want to create. In general, for rarer objects you will need an artisan who knows how to work the material, have a crafting guide or similar. You can see the cost of hiring an artisan in the following table. If you hire an artisan to create a unique object with special materials, the cost per day is 15 gp.

## Hiring an Artisan

Object type
Normal (common labors of the artisan)
Special (special materials)
Unique (completely new object)

## Cost per day

2 gp
5 gp
$10+\mathrm{gp}$

## Special Materials

To create an object with special materials, you need an amount of material units: For a medium-sized creature, when you use the materials for crafting armors and clothing, you need 3 units of the same material, for weapons and shields you need 2 units of the same material and for 10 units of ammunition you need 1 unit of the same material. If you want to craft something for a bigger sized creature, you need to use twice the amount of materials used for each size increment, and for smaller sized creatures you need only half materials per each size smaller than medium.

As an example, if you want to create an adamantine plate armor for a medium sized character, it will take 60 days to craft it, at a cost of 750 gp and three units of adamantine. If you hire two artisans to work with you in the crafting, it will take 20 days, at a total cost of 950 gp and three units of adamantine.

In case of the creature parts, you gain an extra benefit depending on the creature Challenge Rating, as shown in the following table.

## Creature CR Armor Class Weapons (attack and damage)

| 6 or less | none | none |
| :-- | :--: | :--: |
| $7-12$ | none | +1 |
| $13-18$ | +1 | +2 |
| $19-24$ | +2 | +3 |
| $25+$ | +3 | +4 |

For example, a scale mail created with scales from an adult blue dragon (CR 16) will give you an extra +1 to your armor class, for a total of $15+$ dex modifier (max. +2 ).

# Optional Rule: Material Resistance 

Every armor or weapon made with special materials have a number of resistance points. If the points are reduced to 0 , the piece of equipment is broken and you need to repair it to use it again.

The points are reduced in the following events:

- When you make an attack with a weapon made with a special material and you roll a 1 , the resistance points of the weapon are reduced by 1 point.
- When you take a critical hit from an opponent, it reduces your armor resistance points by 1 .

Each reduced point also reduces the damage dealt for weapons and the AC for armors.

In the following table you can see how many resistance points have a special material depending on the material value. A material that replaces any of the materials mentioned in the table uses the resistance of the replaced material (for example, a coral armor uses the metal resistance points)

## Resistance Points by Value

| Material Value | Clothing, non-metallic | Wood | Metal |
| :-- | :-- | :--: | :--: |
| 100 or less | 2 | 3 | 4 |
| $101-500$ | 3 | 4 | 5 |
| $501-1.000$ | 4 | 5 | 6 |
| 1.001 or more | 5 | 6 | 7 |

## Repairing Equipment

If you want to repair a piece of equipment made with a special material, you need to make a tools check using the required artisan tools. The DC equals to $8+$ total amount of reduced points.

Depending on what you're trying to repair, you need to use a number of units of the same material, as shown in the following table.

| Equipment type | Number of Material Units |
| :-- | :-- |
| Armor | 2 units |
| Weapon | 1 unit |

If you pass the check, the equipment is repaired completely. If you fail the check, you can make another check when you finish a long rest.

## Common Items Resistance

You can also apply this rules to common materials like iron and wood. Determine the resistance points using the market value of the items, and for repairing them you will need units of iron, wood, or any other common material.

# Part 6: Dangers of the Wild 

## Environmental Hazards

In this section you can find new environmental hazards, which follows similar rules as traps or lair actions. To determine the DC and damage, use the following tables.

## Hazards Save DCs and Attack Bonuses

| Hazard Danger Level | Save DC |  |  |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Setback | $10-11$ |  |  |
| Dangerous | $12-15$ |  |  |
| Deadly | $16-20$ |  |  |

Damage Severity by Level

| Character Level | Setback | Dangerous | Deadly |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| 1st-4th | 1 d 10 | 2 d 10 | 4 d 10 |
| 5th-10th | 2 d 10 | 4 d 10 | 10 d 10 |
| 11th-16th | 4 d 10 | 10 d 10 | 18 d 10 |
| 17th-20th | 10 d 10 | 18 d 10 | 24 d 10 |

## Hazard Examples

In the following section you can find a series of new hazards ready to use in your campaigns. Each hazard has one or more hazard danger levels which determine the DC for the checks and the damaged they deal.

## Avalanches, Rockfalls and Mudslides Any Level of Hazard

Any character in the area where the hazard occurs must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes bludgeoning damage and is buried by the hazard, or half as much damage on a successful one. The area is filled with snow, rubble or mud and becomes difficult terrain.

Any buried creature is considered suffocated, and it can dig through to free itself. To do so, the creature must succeed a number of Strength (Athletics) checks, as shown in the following table.

## Hazard Level

Number of Checks
Setback 2
Dangerous 3
Deadly 4
You can read more about suffocating rules in the chapter 8 of the Player's Handbook.

## Blizzard

Setback Hazard

The area affected by a blizzard is considered difficult terrain. When a creature without proper shelter is in the area affected by the blizzard for one hour, it must make a Constitution saving throw, taking cold damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. If a creature is wearing warm clothing, it has advantage on the saving throw.

## Earthquakes

Any Level of Hazard
A tremor shakes the area; each creature on the ground in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.

The hazard level is determined by the proximity to the epicenter or the intensity of the earth tremor:

- Setback. Far from the epicenter or light earthquake.
- Dangerous. Near the epicenter or moderate earthquake.
- Deadly. Very close to the epicenter or severe earthquake.


## Elemental Cloud

Any Level of Hazard
This cloud is made with elemental essence. When a creature enters the cloud, it must make an appropriate saving throw, taking damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn in the cloud must roll another saving throw.

| Cloud Color | Damage Type | Saving Throw |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Black | Necrotic | Constitution |
| Cyan | Cold | Constitution |
| Gray and Yellow | Lightning | Dexterity |
| Light Green | Acid | Constitution |
| Purple | Psychic | Wisdom |
| Red | Fire | Constitution |
| White | Force | Intelligence |

## Hailstorm

Dangerous Hazard
Similar to a blizzard, the terrain affected by the hailstorm is considered difficult terrain. When a creature without proper shelter is in the area affected by the hailstorm for one hour, it must make a Constitution saving throw, taking cold damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Insect Swarm

Setback Hazard
A cloud of swarming insects fills a 20 -foot-radius sphere. The swarm moves at 20 feet on each round. When a creature enters the cloud, it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes piercing damage, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn in the cloud must roll another saving throw. A creature cannot be damaged by the insect swarm if it's wielding a torch or if it is at least 5 feet from a fire.

---

## Lightning Storms

Dangerous or Deadly Hazard
The DM rolls a d100 to determine if any creature is hit by a lightning.

This check can be made at the beginning of each turn during a combat or in any time while the party is not in combat.

| d100 | Number of Creatures |
| :-- | :-- |
| $1-50$ | 0 |
| $51-70$ | $1 d 4$ |
| $71-80$ | $1 d 6$ |
| $81-90$ | $1 d 8$ |
| $91-100$ | $1 d 10$ |

The creatures hit by a lightning are determined by the DM, and any creature in the area under total cover from above cannot take damage.

## Magma Eruptions

Dangerous Hazard
Magma erupts from a point on the ground, creating a 20 -foothigh, 5 -foot-radius geyser. Each creature in the geyser's area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

## Poison Clouds and Spores

Setback Hazard
When a creature enters the cloud, it must make a Constitution saving throw, taking poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn in the cloud must make another saving throw.

## RAPIDS

## Setback Hazard

When a creature enters the rapids, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take bludgeoning damage, or half as much damage on a successful one. The creatures in the rapids are pushed 30 feet in the direction of the water flow, and any Large or smaller creature inside the rapids must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take damage.

Any creature caught by the rapids can move by swimming and it can make a Strength (Athletics) check to swim out of the rapids.

## Rogue Wave

Dangerous Hazard
A large and unexpected wave that can be extremely dangerous. When a creature is hit by the rogue wave, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take bludgeoning damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. The rogue wave, along with any creatures in it, moves in a straight line at a speed of 50 feet per turn, and any Huge or smaller creature inside the wall must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take damage. The wave damage is reduced by 1 d 10 on each subsequent round. When the damage is reduced to 0 , the wave ends.

A creature caught by the wave can move by swimming and it can make a Strength (Athletics) check to swim out of the wave.

## SandStorms

Dangerous Hazard
Any creature in the sandstorm must make a Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the sandstorm ends. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature cannot be blinded by the sandstorm if it's wearing goggles or something that protects its eyes.

Any check that relies on sight is made with disadvantage for the duration of the sandstorm.

## Unsteady Ground

Setback Hazard
The floor in the area is considered difficult terrain. Any creature on the ground that starts moving on its turn while in the area must succeed on a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check or fall prone. If a creature uses a Dash action or bonus action, it must make another check.

---

## Dangerous Terrains

In the following section you can find survival considerations and hazards for various terrains. You can combine different terrains to create a more dynamic (and probably more deadly) environment.

## ARCTIC

Cold and Extreme Cold. The temperatures in this environment are lower than other places, and you need proper gear for resisting this temperatures. Whenever the temperature is at or below 0 degrees Fahrenheit, you must follow the rules of extreme cold.

## Extreme Cold (DMG, P.110)

Whenever the temperature is at or below 0 degrees Fahrenheit, a creature exposed to the cold must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour or gain one level of exhaustion. Creatures with resistance or immunity to cold damage automatically succeed on the saving throw, as do creatures wearing cold weather gear (thick coats, gloves, and the like) and creatures naturally adapted to cold climates.

Food Scarcity. It's hard to find food like plants and creatures due the low temperatures. All the checks for foraging and hunting have a DC equal to 20 .

Shelter. In general, the arctic areas are vast frozen plains with big glaciers and rocks, making it difficult to find a natural shelter.

## Environmental Hazards

| Hazard | Source | Notes |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Avalanches | WSG, P. 20 | Only near mountains |
| Blizzard | WSG, P. 20 |  |
| Elemental Cloud | WSG. 20 | Cyan clouds only |
| Frigid Water | DMG, P. 110 |  |
| Hailstorm | WSG, P. 20 |  |
| Chasms and Ice Cracks | DMG, P. 122 | Use the pits trap |
| Slippery Ice | DMG, P. 110 |  |
| Thin Ice | DMG, P. 111 |  |

## Gaves

Darkness and Light. Most of the natural caves don't have light sources, so anyone who enters must bring their sources of light and fire for warmth, cooking and in some cases, defense. A caves might have some light sources, such as groups of fluorescent fungus or other dangerous light sources, like lava.

Orientation and tracking. Inside a cave it's almost impossible to determine where's North: lots of caves are just tunnels connected, making it more difficult to create an accurate map of it.

Flooding. Some parts of the caves might be close to a water source or any other liquid that can quickly fill a room.

| Environmental Hazards |  |  |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Hazard | Source | Notes |
| Earthquakes | WSG, P. 20 | Might cause rockfalls |
| Elemental Cloud | WSG, P. 20 |  |
| Lava | WSG, P. 20 |  |
| Pits | DMG, P. 122 |  |
| Rockfalls | WSG, P. 20 |  |
| Unsteady Ground | WSG, P. 21 |  |

## DESERT

Heat and Extreme Heat. The oposite of the arctic terrain, temperatures in this environment are higher than other places, and you need enough water supplies for resisting the heat. Whenever the temperature is at or above 100 degrees Fahrenheit, you must follow the rules of extreme heat.

## Extreme Heat (DMG, P.110)

When the temperature is at or above 100 degrees Fahrenheit, a creature exposed to the heat and without access to drinkable water must succeed on a Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour or gain one level of exhaustion. The DC is 5 for the first hour and increases by 1 for each additional hour. Creatures wearing medium or heavy armor, or who are clad in heavy clothing, have disadvantage on the saving throw. Creatures with resistance or immunity to fire damage automatically succeed on the saving throw, as do creatures naturally adapted to hot climates.

Shelter. In general, the desert areas are just sand and rocks (in some areas they might be some scattered shrubs), making it difficult to find a safe campsite.

Strong Wind. A strong wind imposes disadvantage on ranged weapon attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing. A strong wind also extinguishes open flames, disperses fog, and makes flying by nonmagical means nearly impossible. A flying creature in a strong wind must land at the end of its turn or fall.

A strong wind in a desert can create a sandstorm that imposes disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

Water Scarcity. Finding water in a desert is extremely difficult, unless you're near an Oasis. All checks made for getting water have a DC equal to 20.

## Environmental Hazards

| Hazard | Source | Notes |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Earthquakes | WSG, P. 20 |  |
| Elemental Cloud | WSG, P. 20 | Mostly red clouds |
| Lightning Storms | WSG, P. 21 |  |
| Sandstorms | WSG, P. 21 |  |

---

## FORESTS AND JUNGLES

Density. Sometimes is hard to walk through a forest due the great number of plants, trees and vegetation. In most of the cases, you can't walk in a straight line through the forest.

Orientation and tracking. Inside a forest, the trees covers the sky, making it hard to determine where's North, and depending the density of the forest it might be harder to keep a track.

Sight and hearing. It might be more difficult to see or hear your surroundings because the density of the forest, the tree shadows, obstacles (such a fallen tree) and the sound of the trees and vegetation moving with the wind.

## Environmental Hazards

| Hazard | Source | Notes |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Earthquakes | WSG, P. 20 | Might cause trees to fall |
| Elemental Cloud | WSG, P. 20 |  |
| Insect Swarms | WSG, P. 20 |  |
| Lightning Storms | WSG, P. 21 | Might cause a forest fire |
| Poison Clouds <br> and Spores | WSG, P. 21 |  |
| Razorvine | DMG, P. 110 |  |

## LAKES, RIVERS AND OCEAN

Orientation and tracking. In the middle of the ocean or under a storm, it's difficult to determine the cardinal points without the proper tools.

Shipwrecks. In the ocean, lakes and even in rivers there're rocks, icebergs, and more that can damage or destroy a ship or boat.

Water streams. The river streams can change drastically depending on the terrain around the rivers, like the terrain elevation, inclination and waterfalls.

## Environmental Hazards

| Hazard | Source | Notes |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Elemental Cloud | WSG, P. 20 |  |
| Hailstorm | WSG, P. 20 | Only near arctic zones |
| Frigid Water | DMG, P. 110 | Ocean only |
| Lightning Storms | WSG, P. 21 |  |
| Rapids | WSG, P. 21 | Rivers only |
| Rogue Wave | WSG, P. 21 | Ocean only |

## MOUNTAINS

Altitude. When you're traveling at altitudes of 10,000 feet or higher above sea level, you must follow the high altitude rules.

## High Altitude (DMG, P.110)

Traveling at altitudes of 10,000 feet or higher above sea level is taxing for a creature that needs to breathe, because of the reduced amount of oxygen in the air. Each hour such a creature spends traveling at high altitude counts as 2 hours for the purpose of determining how long that creature can travel.

Breathing creatures can become acclimated to a high altitude by spending 30 days or more at this elevation. Breathing creatures can't become acclimated to elevations above 20,000 feet unless they are native to such environments.

Strong wind. A strong wind imposes disadvantage on ranged weapon attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing. A strong wind also extinguishes open flames, disperses fog, and makes flying by nonmagical means nearly impossible. A flying creature in a strong wind must land at the end of its turn or fall.

A strong wind in a desert can create a sandstorm that imposes disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

## Environmental Hazards

| Hazard | Source | Notes |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Avalanches, rockfalls <br> and mudslides | WSG, P. 18 |  |
| Blizzard | WSG, P. 20 |  |

| Lava | WSG, P. 18 | Near volcanoes |
| Lightning Storms | WSG, P. 21 |  |
| Magma Eruptions | WSG, P. 21 | Near Volcanoes |
| Unsteady Ground | WSG, P. 21 |  |

## SWAMPS

Clean water. Swamps are characterized by having slowmoving water and stagnant waters, making a bit difficult to find drinkable water. Drinking stagnant water might cause diseases.

Warmth. The swamps are wet and soggy, so finding dry resources for making a fire it's almost impossible.

Low visibility. Mist, fog and lowlands are common in this terrain and they reduce the visibility of any creature.

## Special Terrains

In the wilderness, there're places that have been touched by ancient magic or energies for centuries, creating a persistent effect on those lands. Here're some ideas for creating special terrains you can add to flesh a particular zone in the wild.

## Blood Rock

This area were part of old and forgotten ceremonial sacrifices, a massive battle between armies that fought for centuries or the place where a powerful otherwordly creature was slain. The area is covered by stones with a red tone, bones covered by dirt and mud and dry blood. Any creature standing in this area can score a critical hit on a 19 or 20.

Long-Term Effect: A creature must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw at the end of each hour. On a failed save, the creature must use its action each round to attack the nearest creature it sees. At the end of each of its turns, the creature can make a new Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the effect ends until another hour passes.

## Death Circle Ruins

This area surrounded by dark stone pillars is infused with necrotic energy. Any healing effect, such as a cure wounds spell only heals half the total ammount in this area.

Long-Term Effect: A living creature must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour. On a failed save, its hit point maximum is reduced by 1 d 6 . To recover the reduced hit points, the creature must spend 1 hour outside the area covered by the death circle ruins.

## Defiled Ground

The dark energy fills this area, attracting undead creatures to this area. Any undead creature gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls while standing in the defiled ground. Aditionally, when an undead is reduced to 0 hit points, roll a d20. On a 10 or higher, the undead creature rises with 1 hit point on its next turn. If an undead is reduced to 0 hit points by radiant damage, it cannot roll for rising again.

Long-Term Effect: A creature must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour. On a failed save, it takes 5 necrotic damage.

## Grab Grass

This thick, tough grass grows in areas constantly touched by Feywild magic that clings to characters and creatures that falls prone. An area covered by grab grass is considered difficult terrain, and any creature that falls prone in this area must make a Strength (Athletics) check to stand up (DC 10).

## Life Circle Ruins

This area surrounded by white stone pillars is infused with pure life energy. Every 1 minute, any living creature that begins its turn in the area regains 2 hit points.

Long-Term Effect: Any living creature that stays in this area for 1 hour can end either one disease or one condition afflicting it. The condition can be blinded, deafened, paralyzed or poisoned.

## Planetoughed

Due to planar energy, a powerful artifact or some other factor, this terrain boosts certain types of energy related to one plane. Pick one damage type from the following list: Acid, Cold, Fire, Force, Lightning, Necrotic, Psychic or Radiant. Any attack that deals the choosen damage type deals an extra 1d6 damage of that type.

## Sacred Shrine

A sacred shrine is dedicated to a particular deity, infusing with divine energy the area nearby. A creature that shares the deity's alignment gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls while standing in the area covered by the shrine.

Long-Term Effect: A creature that has a different alignment to the deity's alignment must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw at the end of each hour. On a failed save, it has disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures that shares the deity's alignment. At the end of each of its turns, the creature can make a new Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the effect ends until another hour passes.
