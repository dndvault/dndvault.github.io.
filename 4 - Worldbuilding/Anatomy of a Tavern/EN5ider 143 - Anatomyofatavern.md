### Atmosphere

You can get a good sense of a tavern just by surveying the main room. From the moment the PCs walk in, they are able to ascertain a few crucial facts about the tavern's character.

1. The PCs clearly do not belong. The noise and murmur of the tavern stop abruptly as the PCs walk in, and every eye in the room goes to them. The patrons look like average citizens, but a conspiratorial atmosphere pervades. Conversation resumes after a few seconds, but backs are turned and voices hush as the PCs walk by.
2. The tavern is large, smoky, and stinks of spilled beer. Patrons sit in drunken stupors, and waiters step over the unconscious ones. Nobody cares when  
the PCs enter. They seem just like another group of low-lives looking to dissolve themselves in their drinks.
3. They serve far more than alcohol in this dismal place. The smoke in the air reeks of opium, and other stronger stuff. Along the walls, comatose customers lay on filthy cushions. The room is silent and the atmosphere reeks of people resigned to an unhappy and inevitable fate.
4. This is a large, well-lit tavern, with enough room for at least 50 patrons. However, only one table is occupied. The bartender's face is a panicked mask, his suffering margins evident in his overeager greeting. He rushes to attend to the PCs, desperate to get new customers.
5. This tavern is far nicer than it looks from the outside. Tables are of clean mahogany, and the glass cups add an element of wealth. A small silver chandelier hangs from the ceiling, illuminating the crimson tapestries on the walls.
6. Warm laughter and the smell of fresh bread escapes from the tavern. This is a cozy place where friends come to drink and spend the evening in idle chatter.

### Signature Drink

Most taverns serve a signature drink, and those that do not usually serve one on request. It is not always cheap, but it gives a good sense of the establishment's character.

1. Aegin's Wine. White wine from a faraway elven land, blessed with the gift of being always cold.
2. Black Lager. A stout and yeast mixture so thick it has the consistency of mud. A pint of black lager is filling enough for a meal.
3. Breügar's Brew. A thick, milky porter brewed by a famous dwarven brewery.
4. Demondrink. Heavily distilled bourbon, served with a burning flame on top.
5. Fish Lips. A salty beer, delicious to connoisseurs and disgusting to everybody else.
6. Fizz Ale. Extremely carbonated, but an otherwise very pleasant ale.

---

7. Forest's Blessing. Various fermented berries and herbs. Batches vary in flavor, but every serving is tongue-numbingly sweet.
8. Kitchen Soup. A randomly chosen mixture of old beer, sour wine, and hard alcohol.
9. Milk Wine. Warm red wine with a froth of fresh milk.
10. Red Honey. Honeymead with day-old strawberries.
11. The Cleanser. A shot of grain alcohol.
12. "We Got Grog". They only serve grog here, a sour combination of water and rum.

### Signature Meal

All taverns serve food in addition to alcohol. Use the following table to generate a signature meal.

1. Braised ribs with mushrooms and onions
2. Breaded chicken wings with a spicy dipping sauce.
3. Crisped root vegetables with honey.
4. Foul smelling plate of fermented salmon and roast acorns.
5. Fried cheese dumplings with a filling of nuts and honey.
6. Goose liver pate, stale bread, and a surprisingly sophisticated range of cheeses.
7. Hearty meal of roast goose and strips of fried pork.
8. Honey glazed mushrooms and parsnips.
9. Roast rack of lamb with mint and plum sauce.
10. Roasted spareribs, remarkably bland for their excellent smell.
11. Runny vegetable soup overburdened with pepper.
12. Thin platter of mutton, carrots, and tomato.

### BARTENDER

The bartender is perhaps the most important feature of a tavern. He takes orders, serves drinks, and gossips with the customers. Patrons return to a tavern, not for the drinks or food, but for the company. If the bartender is lacking, he'll quickly find himself out of business.

1. Azamagus the Grand (Male Half-Orc). An unemployed sorcerer who believe that this sort of work is far beneath his station. He dresses in bizarre purple robes, makes sloppy drinks, and takes secret pleasure in impressing customers with minor feats of magic. With every poured beer, he lets out a large sigh and mumbles about wasted arcane power and unanswered evils waiting to be slain.
2. Burdonk Brubart (Male Halfling). An ancient halfling with a stoop. He clearly used to be some great warrior; battle scars mar his flesh, to say nothing of the runes of power etched into his forehead. He brushes off questions about his past, but the name of the tavern holds some clue.
3. Groda (Female Dwarf). Her accent is totally indecipherable. Dressed in singed leather and armed with a tiny hammer, Groda seems a better fit for a blacksmith than a tavern. A swollen jaw and massive white muttonchops only hinder comprehension, but the usual patrons have no trouble understanding every slobbered word out of her mouth.
4. Janhawk Ironhammer (Male Dwarf). He has a craggy face which never stops smiling. His foul breath seeps from between brown teeth, and it's hard to ignore the beard hairs in the drinks he serves. However, he is an amiable fellow and more than willing to sit with customers and tell them stories of his youth-even if it means the bar goes unattended for hours.
5. Meena Burge (Female Human). She is definitely too young for this sort of thing; no more than 8. Under her short brown hair and perpetual scowl, Meena berates customers for any perceived transgression. She refuses to answer any questions about her age or profession, responds to jokes with glares, and is universally adored by her patrons. She has never tasted alcohol, but still prepares excellent mixed drinks.

---

6. Shielain (Female Elf). She is almost supernaturally attractive, a beaming, giggling woman with soft eye, golden hair, and perfect teeth. Something about her seems entirely off, almost feral, but the patrons do not seem to mind.

### Patrons

A tavern is nothing without its patrons. Each tavern attracts a certain kind of guests, but some stick out from the crowd.

1. A butcher, bloody from a day's work, sits quietly and sips a glass of hard alcohol. Alone and quite drunk, he wears a distant smile and gazes indistinctly at the bartender.
2. A dark skinned human with yellow eyes closely reads from an untitled book. He is intensely focused, but casts furtive glances at any who comes his way. Smoke curls from the long ivory pipe clutched between his lips.
3. A gigantic orc, at least 8 feet tall and covered in hair, sleeps soundly on the floor. Far from intimidating the other customers, some of the smaller patrons even use him as a footrest.
4. A handsome human with grey eyes and a large chin chats up with a trio of interested women, none of his own race. The dwarf, halfling, and elf, apparently friends on the town, are all smitten.
5. A pair of half-elf twins, ruddy and muddy from too much time outdoors, attempt to out drink one  
another. The game is dead serious, and they appear to be working through some sibling rivalries.
6. A red-skinned goblin makes racist jokes to a table of bemused patrons.
7. A sputtering elf pouts in a group of otherwise giddy customers. He is drenched in an absurd amount of wine, as if he took a swim in a barrel of the stuff.
8. A suspicious looking dwarf roams the tables, monitoring intoxication and keeping an eye on purses.
9. A thin, extremely pale man drinks no alcohol, but watches the other patrons with an unreadable stare.
10. An elderly couple sip wine, hold hands, and sit in comfortable silence. They are thin and appear friendly, but their veins and teeth bear the signs of drug abuse.
11. An entire adventuring party sits anxiously in the corner. They sit in awkward silence, and do not appear too comfortable with one another. By the looks of things they are eavesdropping on other people's conversations.
12. Two half-orcs play cards in the back. The larger has apparently won the knives, gold, and shirt of the smaller, but the game goes on. Both appear cool and collected, but intensely focused. The stakes of the current game are unclear.
