# OVERVIEW 

GM Note: This is a live document, and will be updated as the campaign progresses. It is not, by any means, all-inclusive. Particularly: expect to see additional weapons, relevant ammunition types, and other miscellaneous items as the story progresses.

## General Info:

This compendium takes inspiration from aspects of the Victorian/Elizabethan era (a.k.a. the mid to late 1800s). It introduces firearms, various constructs and automatons, multiple classes, races, revisions on traditional races and classes, equipment and mechanics that fit the overall theme that is Steampunk.

## World Background

The world has entered a new era of technological and cultural advancement, allowing the intermingling of new ideas and concepts with fantasy and medieval/Renaissance traditions. This can be applied at whichever scale you choose, from a small scale, where developement is limited to some small countries and cities, to a much larger scale, where the whole world is under the influence of this advancement.

In these areas, population has exploded. Settlements grow and have their population and density rival traditional large cities.

The danger of monsters attacking has dwindled, while the threat of crime has risen. It's much more probable to be a victim of a mugging then be attacked by a horde of orcs in this era, though the danger still exists. You can never really know when monsters and tribes will attack, or how they have advanced with the times, possibly changing their equipment or tactics while keeping true to their basic methods.

## City Vs. Outside World

In the cities, although humans, elves, dwarves, and gnomes make up the majority of the population, other diverse races can be found in smaller numbers, such as kobolds, goblins, half-orcs, dragonborn, etc. Some of these "exotic races", though, prefer the tranquility of the natural world and less populated settlements.

Law enforcement are better equipped then the average town guard, but aren't necessarily better as a result. Medicine has also improved with technological advancement, allowing people in general to live longer and stay healthier.

One can still expect the city to be divided into the traditional poor and rich districts, but this division has worsened to the point where the poor district is much larger, due to the exodus of people moving to cities for their larger job opportunities, their safety, or other reasons.

The richer parts of the cities are usually closer to the city center or at higher elevations, having better access to many different kinds of services, such as the aforementioned medicine and law enforcement. The poorer parts of the cities are usually closer to the city walls; on these outskirts you can find the slums, ghettos, and run-down areas where the poor and struggling gather up to try and survive in this new age in the cities. In these areas, law enforcement and other services are a bit scarcer, causing crime to be more rampant.

The real danger of these cities is the underworld; the nest of criminals; the place where thieves and murderers satiate their growing desire to spread anarchy and commit crime. Usually, the underworld of a city is located in the slums, but in some cities it can be like an infestation that has grown to the size of the whole town. No matter how much law enforcement may try to cut down on underworld activity, they will never be able to destroy it completely, and some may not even want to; corruption spreads largest in very populated areas.

# Races, New and Old 

## AwakENEd UndEAd

## BY U/THE_SINGULAR_ANYONE

THE MISTS CLING TO THE TALL CHARRED PINES of the valeheart woods like clawed spectral fingers, as the billowing breeze breathing through the trees give this miasma a sinister semblance of life. At once menacing and warding against outside visitors to this deathly realm, the locals know well of the evil nature of this forest, and how willing the very air of this place is to choke the live out of those foolish mortals that venture inside.

Nevertheless, a gnarled dwarf by the name Blidwenn gazes into the opaque vapor streaming from the trees, his eyes more accustomed to the dim light of this place than the pure sunshine found in more wholesome lands. Braiding a few errant strands of beard, Blidwenn continues his vigil for well on an hour, tracing the elusive forms in the mist for any sign of living movement. Clasping his braid in a ruddy, calloused hand, the dwarf lets loose a sigh and slowly rises to his feet.

His sharp dwarven eyes snap open and he pauses instantly mid-motion. Movement in the mists, shadows, a shape emerging from the woods. His vision traces the outline of a lean, solitary figure, set bone white against the grey fog. With slow, creaking footsteps, the creature emerges from the fog and advances on the steadfast dwarf.
"That you, Clacks?" Blidwenn rumbles, his hammer suddenly finding itself in his large hands, "You see anything in there?"
"Indeed, friend," the approaching skeleton replies dryly, holding aloft a faint, purple gem, "The master's old phylactery wasn't nearly as well defended as he would have us think."

---

Death comes for all things in a near-infinite variety of ways. So, too, are there many reasons that the dead might return from the grave. Directly applied necromancy, cursed lands, and unfinished buisness are but a few, and all leave the newly-undead soul with a mere semblance of the life it had before. All undead carry the physical or emotional scars of what ended their mortal lives, though some may be far more subtle than others.

## Dead and Reborn

Typically having no lands to call their own, undead with an awakened sense of self are typically perpetual foreigners, wanderers in a land and often a time not their own. Compounding matters, most mortal cultures carry within them an instinctual fear of death and the dead, and many associate necromancy specifically with dark tidings. This forms a wall of (often well earned) prejudice and hatred that sentient undead find themselves up against, and many undead choose to hide their necrotic natures behind clothes, masks, and pungent perfumes when journeying into civilization.

Depending on composition, humanoid undead typically range a wide gamut from 20 to 300 pounds, and may possess empty eyes, a colored flame-like magical aimuss in their sockets, or harrowed, surprisingly mortal eyes burning with an inner fire. Hair (if they have it at all) is usually lank, dark, and wrought with grime and grave dirt that no amount of cleansing will fully remove.

## Service and Freedom

Undeath is effectively immortality, a strong reason why many mortal spellcasters of a certain moral bent consider it a viable alternative to actually dying. Still, it is not immortality without price - senses and emotions dull, food and drink no longer have taste, and often an undead state comes alongside a subservience of will and unthinking service to a master who likely does not have the world's best intentions at heart.

Some undead are born into freedom, while others earn it or have it thrust upon them. Regardless, all undead that have freedom greatly cherish it, as the reminders of what could easily happen were they not fortunate enough to possess free will abound throughout history. Many consider it their sacred duty to free other mindless undead, or simply dispatch them wherever they may be found. The reason is straightforward enough: a final rest awarded to all mortals is greatly preferential to eternal slavery to the likes of a short-sighted, megalomaniacal wizard.

## Fallen Home, Forgotten Past

For many awakened undead, the past is a distant homeland to which they may never return, holding names and faces now partially-forgotten, and loves and lives as dead as they are. The anguish of this loss is enough to drive many mad, but others use this rage and pain as a source of power and drive, carrying them further on the road to whatever dark destiny awaits.

Frequently, entire countries, customs, and cultures the undead may be familiar with no longer exist, and the sentient dead behaves or speaks in a antiquated fashion because of this. It may be even more difficult than usual for such undead to relate to more modern mortals, and typically these undead leverage what companions they may have to bridge this epoch-long communication gap.

## Undead Names

Many undead that awaken into sentience prefer to keep the names they held in their mortal lives. For others however, their mortal names are forgotten or have lost meaning. These undead often adopt nicknames given to them by their former masters or present companions, and hold them to be as true as any other creature's birth name.

---

Examples of names given in this fashion may be seen below:

Names: Rattlebones, Spore, Rotface, Raven, Bane, Carver, Drudge, Rook, Mort, Pale, Minion, Crumble, Shade

## Awakened Undead Traits

Awakened undead have the following traits in common:
Ability Score Increase. Your Constitution score increases by 1 .

Dead Immortality. You do not age. Given time, the necromantic energies that sustain you will heal most wounds you take at approximately the same rate as a mortal, and your hit dice function as normal.

Past Life. Choose another living race besides this one. Before your death, you were a member of this race and appear as an undead version of it. Your size, height, and movement speed are the same as a typical member of that race. You do not retain special movement speeds from this race (such as swimming or flying), and, though you may choose to have formerly been a member of a subrace of a particular race, you derive no benefits from doing so.

Undead. Raised from the dead as a beaing of undeath, you count as an undead creature for all spells and abilities that affect the undead. You are immune to disease and treat exhaustion as if it was one level less. You do not need to eat or breathe, but you can ingest food and drink if you wish. Instead of sleeping, you enter an inactive state for 4 hours each day. You do not dream in this state; you are fully aware of your surroundings and notice approaching enemies and other events as normal.

Darkvision. Through the necromantic energy animating you, you are able to perceive with greater clarity thatwhich lurks in the darkness. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of grey.

Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and one language avalible to the race you chose for your Past Life.

Subrace. Three types of awakened undead are avalible to you. Choose Skeleton, Revenant, or Ghost, listed in the following sections.

## SKELETONS

An animated figure made of dry bones devoid of flesh and muscle, you were likely raised by a necromantic caster or dark, supernatural curse as a simple minion, completely without will and self knowledge. Something changed, however; perhaps your master was slain, the land cleansed, or you merely awoke one day to fragmented memories of your previous life. Whatever the case, possessed of a fragmented sense of self and newfound purpose, you struck out into the wider world to find a new destiny.

Ability Score Increase. Your Dexterity or Intelligence score increases by 2 .

Bloodless. You are immune to poison damage and the poisoned condition.

Bone Pile. When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. If you do, you reduce yourself to a pile of bones, render yourself prone, and are considered under a similar effect to the feign death spell. While subject to this condition, you are unable to move or take action other than using your action to end this effect. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

Bone To Pick. Whenever both of your hands are free (not including equipped shields), you may use a free hand and a bonus action to remove one of your hands or arms. If you remove an arm, it counts as a weapon with the finesse property that deals 1 d 6 bludgeoning damage, and you have proficiency with your arm while you wield it. If you remove a hand, it counts as thieves' tools or a similar set of simple tools while you hold it. In either case, removed hands and arms may be re-attached by using another bonus action.

## REVENANT

When a brutal murder or an atrocious crime slays an innocent soul endowed with sufficient willpower, there is a rare occasion where the victim refuses to stand by and stay dead. You were created not at the whim of a mortal spellcaster, but when you were slain and either a god of death, veneance, or justice, or you yourself, took enough umbrage at the death to raise you from the grave, typically at least a full day (though sometimes up to centuries, if the revenge is still relevant) after your death occured.

---

Born again out of an undying thirst for vengeance, you will not rest until the wrongs surrounding your death have been righted. Though you superficially appear similar to a zombie, complete with tattered flesh and sporadic decay, your eye gleam with an intelligent intent, a burning passionate fury that will lay low all in your way.

Ability Score Increase. Your Charisma or Strength score increases by 2.

Eternal Vengance. You know at all times the general direction of and relative distance to a creature of the DM's choosing against whom you seek revenge for your death, even if the creature and you are on different planes of existence. Should this creature die by your hand or that of another, you instantly know, and your DM chooses another creature also responsible for your death for their feature to apply to, should such a creature exist.

Poison Resilience. You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage.

Unnatural Vitality. When you drop to 0 hit points, you may choose to stay conscious instead of falling unconscious. If you do, you gain temporary hit points equal to your total character level. In this state, you may take an action or bonus action on your turn, but not both, and you make death saving throws at the end of your turn as usual. You can remain in this state until you fail your first death saving throw (at which point you fall unconscious and continue making death saving throws until you stabilize or regain additional hit points) or die outright to massive damage. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

## Ghost

Lingering souls of the dead and departed, ghost are raised as servants by potent necromancers or hold onto the world theselves where there is unfinished business they yet to accomplish. Adventurous ghosts such as yourself typically either escape the masters that raised them or have something unresolved from their days amongst the living that requires they journey far and wide. If a ghost is charged with unfinished business it can take many forms, from protecting a loved one to keeping a particular item safe to simple revenge. Ghosts are spectral and luminous, but solid to the touch, and can interact with objects as mortals do. All ghosts carry obvious and sometimes twisted marks of what caused their death, which are often quite disturbing to all but the most jaded mortals.

Ability Score Increase. Your Charisma or Wisdom score increases by 2.

Bloodless. You are immune to poison damage and the poisoned condition.

Flight. You gain a fly speed equal to half your land spee, rounded up to the nearest 5 feet.

Withering Touch. Your unarmed strike deals necrotic damage, as well as additional damage equal to your Constitution modifier.

Incorporeal Stride. You can move through other creature and objects other than physical barriers (such as walls or ceilings) as if they were difficult terrain. Once per short rest, you may pass through up to 10 feet of physical barriers (treating them as difficult terrain) as a part of movement. You take 1 d 10 force damage if you end your turn inside an object or barrier, and are immediately ejected to the closest available space if within a barrier.

## A Matter of Life and Death

Death doesn't have to be the end for a player character - an interested DM may allow a dead character to rise from their grave as one of the awakened undead, replacing the character's race and subrace features with those listed here.

Conversely, an awakened undead character can wish to regain their mortal life. This may only be achieved through the use of the true resurrection spell, and, again, DM permission. A character returning to their mortal life replaces their awakened undead race and subrace with what they chose for their Past Life feature, loses all features and abilities associated with being an awakened undead, and instead gains abilities typical for a member of their new race.

## ClocKWORK AutOMATON

## By u/MaxhyDRO

There was once an ambitious master engineer who wanted to create life. The engineer gave their all to birth such a creation, until finally, using clockwork prosthetics, the scientist created fully sentient automatons. At first they were mindless machines, blindly following orders, but eventually they grew consciousness, thoughts, and emotions. They'd ask questions and wonder if they too were living beings. No such answer was found, and the scientist died in the wake of their creations - or so it is thought.

The future of this race of machines is a mystery; only a few automatons were made to the complexity of the scientist's original design, and all of their schematics, blueprints, plans, and notes vanished with their death, save for a single note, telling of a secret apprentice that would continue their work where no one could find them. Few automatons exist claiming to have a "soul", but it's likely more will appear when the apprentice comes out of hiding.

## Physical Description

Made of gears, metal, and cogs held together by magic, Clockwork Automatons are beings unlike any other. They are constructed out of combinations of thick ceramic and metal filaments built around a metallic skeletal frame, with a mysterious fibrous material acting as a muscular system. A network of tubes runs through the Automaton's body, filled with a blood-like fluid designed to lubricate and nourish their gears.

Automatons are completely sexless and genderless. Though their bodies may have been designed with masculine or feminine features, these are considered by the Automatons to be little more than aesthetics. Automatons are able to be repaired and modified by those with the right training, which makes for an endless array of possible changes to their appearances in the hands of capable engineers.

A Clockwork Automaton on average stands little taller than their creator's race's height and weighs in at 100 - 300 lbs. These numbers will vary among specific Automatons.

## Personality

Clockwork Automatons have unique personalities and experience anger, pain, fear, and hatred, just like their human creators. But Automatons naturally seem reserved, stoic, and pensive, hiding an array of emotions behind their minorly inexpressive metallic faces. Their faces were not designed to display facial expressions, merely to replicate talking, so at times they appear to be distant to the conversation. Despite their lack of physical facial expressions, they're not completely without them, as their eyes tend to brighten when experiencing strong or specific emotions. Some Automatons have their faces modified to be more expressive for their companion's comfort, but these expressions are learned rather than natural and often appear stilted and awkward.

Some Automatons can be incredibly naive and lack a sense of introspection. However, many others are the opposite and question their existence, they wonder if, as constructs, they have souls, and ask what becomes of them in the afterlife. More intelligent automatons create complex philosophies about what they perceive and learn. Though they can show loyalty to religions and organizations, typically they become loyal to a small group of comrades.

Automatons built for war understand duty, the chain of command, and conflict. But aside from this, many Automatons often have little life experience as they have spent most of their time working towards one specific duty. If there is one interest all Clockwork Automatons share it is their love of working and the satisfaction of a job well done. Many create endless lists of goals and chores to feed that feeling. They take pride in their work and can work incredibly hard, both traits that make them dislike idleness and failure. Automatons can excel at most tasks, having a single-minded efficiency, especially in combat related roles. But this same single-mindedness can often translate to a lack of creativity and they can be easily surprised or "outflanked."

Clockwork Automatons dislike being called "it" and usually accept the gendered pronoun that they most closely resemble. Some Automatons adopt names from the culture they were created in, though most of their names were assigned at construction and are straightforward and related to their job, abilities or rank. Many Automatons simply accept the nicknames given to them by their comrades while others seek more meaningful names that best describe them.

## Automaton Names

Clockwork Automatons are usually given names by their creators, either named for their purpose or rank or adopted from the naming tradtions of the race that created them.

Some Automatons adopt a "personal name," chosen for themselves after long periods of soul-searching. This name is usually a special designation an Automaton reserves only for their friends and carries sentimental meaning to them.

Examples of names given in this fashion may be seen below:

Names: Andromeda, Hunter, Legacy, Loki, Babylon, Raven, Harmony, Hercules, Exarch, Nexus, Legionnaire, Vagabond, Vice

Names of Automatons can also be choosen by trusted companions or by parental figures that hold a sort of close bond.

Examples of names given in this fashion may be seen below:

Names: Prime, Alpha, Gears, Tick Tock, Brass, Spirit, Silver, Gold, Plexi, Bronze, Steel, Id

## AutOMATON TRaITS

You share a number of traits with other Automatons:
Ability Score Increase. Your Constitution score increases by 1 .
Age. Automatons are created as adults; they have no childhood or adolescence. It is theorized that Automatons may show signs of physical deterioration after about 150-200 years, but have no further aging effects after that point and no maximum age.
Alignment. Automatons tend toward lawful alignments, as they were constructed to be built for one purpose, usually to help.
Size. Automatons who are gendered as "male" tend to have broader and heavier builds while "female" gendered automatons are thinner, looking more like the race they were modeled after, with more elegant facial features. Your size is Medium.
Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
Living Construct. Even though you were constructed, you are a living creature. You are immune to disease. You do not need to eat or breathe, but you can ingest food and drink if you wish.
Instead of sleeping, you enter an inactive state for 4 hours each day. You do not dream in this state; you are fully aware of your surroundings and notice approaching enemies and other events as normal.
Composite Plating. Your construction incorporates metal sheeting, granting you a +1 bonus to Armor Class.
Electrical Conductivity Lightning based attacks are extremely effective against you. When you take lightning damage you must make a Constitution Saving throw, instead of the required saving throw, equal to half the damage or a DC of 15 (which ever is higher).
If you succeed, take half damage, additionally you can use your reaction to shot a lightning attack at the target within 60 feet dealing 1 d 8 lightning damage. The scaling damage of this is the same as the spell shocking grasp. On a failure you have disadvantage on your next melee or ranged weapon attack.
Hydrolock If you end your turn at least halfway submerged in water or any liquid your gears will begin to lock up and function at a lowered pace.
Your movement speed is decreased by 10 , and you have disadvantage to attacks and skill checks. Enemies will have advantage on attacks against you until you take a short rest. (Repairs are a pricey alternative).
Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and your creator's native language (select one language at random if your creator is human).
Subraces. Only four configurations for Automatons were known to have been created or altered, each quite unique in their own respect, built for different jobs.

## Guardian Automaton

Guardian Automatons were built to protect and serve others, always wishing to keep everyone safe and fend off those who would harm weaker beings.

Pushing the Limits. You gain proficiency in your choice of Arcana, History, Perception, or Persuasion.

## MedICAL AutOMATON

Made to help people who are injured, these are well known for their medical prowess. They instinctively know how to treat minor injury, but they still require training for conditions that are more severe.
Ability Score Increase. Your Wisdom score increases by 1.
Rest Easy. You have proficiency in the Medicine skill (if you already have proiciency in medicine you have expertiese in it).
Bilingual. You can speak an additional language of your choice.

## DROMITE

## By KenMarble

## Another Cosmos

Beyond the known planes of existence lie other realities. These are not simply additional planes. They are entirely different cosmologies, entire sets of planes organized in ways far different from the known cosmology. One such reality was the home of the dromites.

Unlike the known Inner Planes that are composed of the four elements as well as Positive and Negative Energy planes, the reality of the dromites was based on the five energies (acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sound) as well as the planes of Elemental Life and Elemental Undeath all intertwined within the Ocean of Thought. This cosmology was known as the Cosmic Mesh, as each plane of existence was a strand woven through the others merging and splitting in an infinite weave.

The dromites were beings touched by the Energy Planes, much like the elemental genasi of this reality. Just as the planes were interwoven with each other, so too do the dromite castes typically live with and are born to each other. Each caste is touched by one of the forms of energy, but they are not subraces in a traditional sense since any type can be born within a community.

## Invasion of Nightmare

The influence of the Ocean of Thought engulfing these planes lead to a preponderance of psionic magic both from trained practitioners, as well as abilities native to the beings themselves. The power of the dromites manifested itself in their use of their planetouched energy, but other races, most long forgotten, were born with a wide array of psionic abilities.

Unfortunately, such a concentration of psionic ability garnered the attention of a dimension of nightmare. Slowly corrupting the beings within these planes, this nightmare dimension managed to seep its way into that reality. As the infestation grew, it reached a threshold and these planes were opened up entirely to this dreadful realm.

Horrors surged throughout that entire universe, consuming and twisting its inhabitants into frightening monstrosities. As the end drew near, the dromites managed to find a means for some of them to escape. The Pyre Caste had discovered links, almost like metaphysical overlaps, between their Energy Plane of Fire and our own reality's corresponding Elemental Plane.

Drohma, the goddess and mother of the dromites sacrificed herself in a conflagration of divine energy strong enough to rip a hole between the two realities. Waves of dromites fled before the link was broken in hopes of containing the infestation to that reality. Now refugees in another reality, dromites have tried to find a place and a new purpose.

## Dromite Traits

Your dromite character has a number of traits in common with all other dromites.
Ability Score Increase. Your Charisma score increases by 2.
Age. Dromites mature slightly faster than humans, reaching adulthood in early to mid-teens. They typically live as long as humans.
Alignment. Dromites tend toward no particular alignment. The best and the worst are found among them.
Size. Dromites average about 3 feet tall and weigh about 40 pounds. Your size is Small.
Speed. Your base walking speed is 25 feet.
Keen Smell. You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.
Natural Armor. Your have hardened, almost exoskeletonlike skin. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC is $12+$ your Dexterity modifier. You can use your natural armor to determine your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC. A shield's benefits apply as normal while you use your natural armor.
Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Primordial.
Subrace. Five subraces of dromite exist: dissolution caste, glimmer caste, ice caste, pyre caste, and voice caste. Choose one of these subraces.

## Glimmer Dromite

In many respects, Glimmer caste dromites are more the opposite of the Ice caste dromites than the Pyre dromites are. While the Ice dromites thoughtfully consider their actions, Glimmer dromites blurt out virtually every thought that ever occurs to them. One would think this would lead to many regretted comments, but Glimmer dromites see life and the world as too fleeting to waste on regrets. To many others, it looks as if Glimmer dromites live their lives as a raceconstantly focusing on the next moment before the current one has been experienced. A Glimmer dromite actually seeing a project through to completion is a rare thing indeed.

Ironically, they actually share some characteristics with the Ice dromites. Their ability to think quickly on their feet actually leads them to be among the more intelligent dromites as well. Furthermore, in their own very different ways, the Ice and Glimmer caste dromites tend to be the ones most focused on the future.

They are tall and thin to the point of occasionally being mistaken for a short elf. Their skin is typically either a near white with deep violet accents or a lavender with striking yellow highlights. In both cases, the colors are in branching patterns similar to cracks of lightning.
Glimmer caste dromites have the following traits.
Ability Score Increase. Your Dexterity score increases by 1.
Energy Resistance. You have resistance to lightning damage.

Speed Burst. You are able to double your movement speed until the end of your turn. You are unable to use this ability again until you complete a short or long rest.
Energy Ray. You know the shocking grasp cantrip. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for it.

## Ice Dromite

The members of the Ice caste tend to be more calculating and analytic than others. Some dromites, especially of the Glimmer and Pyre castes, look upon the members of the Ice caste as slow in thought, and sometimes even dim-witted because their inability to react quickly. This is far from the truth, as Ice dromites tend to be the most intelligent and wise members of their race, but take the time to analyze every action before it is taken, and every word before it is spoken. They may not snap to judgment as the Glimmer dromites would, but their precision in thought and logic are greatly beneficial. A more accurate criticism is that Ice dromites lack emotions. Although not entirely true, they often become too caught up in considering a situation and all the alternative courses of action, that they often leave little room in their thoughts for emotional reactions to grab hold. Besides, emotions can be fleeting, and by the time a Ice dromite reacts, the emotion may have already passed, leaving only the cold logic speaking.
They are broadly built and typically shorter for dromites. Their skin is often a consistent color in the blue to white shades. Any variations in their skin tone is subtle and difficult to notice.
Ice caste dromites have the following traits.
Ability Score Increase. Your Intelligence score increases by 1.
Energy Resistance. You have resistance to cold damage.
Calculating Mind. You have advantage on Intelligence saving throws.
Energy Ray. You know the ray of frost cantrip. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for it.

## Pyre Dromite

Pyre caste dromites are among the most passionate and emotional of their race. Their emotions may seem erratic to others, but to the members of the Pyre caste, this is simply how they react to an ever-changing world. As things happen around them, it only makes sense that their emotional reactions would shift as well. Pyre dromites tend to be the most excluded of the castes because most dromites are not thick-skinned enough to deal with a Pyre caste member calling them their truest friend one day and then bitterly insulting them the next.

---

This does not bother the Pyre dromites greatly, as they prefer their own company anyway. Most of the other castes seem dull and unfeeling to the Pyre dromites. Although the Glimmer caste is as capable as the Pyres to dare to great feats of bravery (or foolishness if you ask the Ice dromites), the Glimmer ones do so more out of compulsion, whereas the Pyre dromites savor every breathtaking moment.

They, along with the Glimmer caste, are typically the tallest of the dromites. However, their builds run the full range from slim to well muscled. The skin tones are typically a pale yellow with red, orange, and deep black streaks and stripes.

Pyre caste dromites have the following traits.
Ability Score Increase. Your Strength score increases by 1.

Energy Resistance. You have resistance to fire damage.
Bold Spirit. You have advantage on saving throws against the frightened condition.

Energy Ray. You know the fire bolt cantrip. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for it.

## Voice Dromite

Voice caste dromites are an interesting blend of the passion of the Pyre caste and the calm of the Ice caste. Their emotional lives are as rich as any Pyre dromites, but it is an introspective richness, every bit as analytical as the Ice dromite's logic, but focused more on the ephemeral emotions within them and the subtle wisdom in the world around. Voice dromites express their emotion through works of art that range from the life-alteringly enlightening to the utterly nonsensical. In the later cases, Voice dromites merely shake their heads in realization that the other castes can never see the world as they do and experience the things they can experience. Even though they prefer contemplation and creative expression to seeking positions of authority within their community, many Voice dromites view themselves as greater than their brethren. They only wish that their art, whether it is a song or a sculpture, helps elevate the other castes toward the serenity and superiority of the Voice dromites.

They are small and thin, making them typically the meekest of the dromites. They are often various shades of grey with one other highlight color, but this color can be virtually anything. These accents ripple over their chitin skin like waves.

Voice Caste dromites have the following traits.
Ability Score Increase. Your Wisdom score increases by 1.

Energy Resistance. You have resistance to thunder damage.

Powerful Hearing. You have advantage on saving throws against the deafened condition.

Musical Talent. You are proficient with one musical instrument of your choice.

Energy Ray. You know the thunderclap cantrip. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for it.

## Dissolution Dromite

Dissolution caste dromites are often somber and can make other dromites uncomfortable. They realize all reality is a cycle of renewal. Living things die and become food for other life. Mountains rise and eventually crumble. Everything is temporary and in transition, and Dissolution dromites are drawn to helping that cycle. Others see them as destructive, but Dissolution dromites feel resisting change is unnatural and harmful. Despite the opinions of others, Dissolution dromites are rarely malicious and are not wanton agents of destruction. They are reminders that anything built will someday fall, and everyone will someday die. These reminders make many other dromites uncomfortable. However, when a dromite community is threatened, the other castes are quick to overlook that as the Dissolution dromites remind their enemies just how transitory their existence is as well.

Members of the Dissolution Caste tend to be thin and frail in appearance. This is deceiving as their wiry frames mask a flexible resilience. Their skin tends towards yellow-greys with green spots and speckles randomly scattered.

Dissolution Caste dromites have the following traits.
Ability Score Increase. Your Constitution score increases by 1.

Energy Resistance. You have resistance to acid damage.
Find the Weak Spot. You can find the weaknesses in objects, and have advantage on attack rolls against objects until the end of your turn. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

Energy Ray. You know the acid splash cantrip. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for it.

# ManneQuin 

## By u/Ezfi

Created by an ambitious wizard who wanted to start a dressmaking business, mannequins are living constructs with the sole purpose of selling wares, clothing in particular. Graceful, sly and alluring, they are perfectly designed to find out what customers want and offer it to them before they can think to ask. While their original inventor is long dead, the recipe for their creation still circulates, and many merchants and nobles employ them for retail and other services. All mannequins are intelligent-they have to be to analyze their clientele so effectively-but most are content in a life of subservience. Only the strangest and most daring among them pursue a life of independence.

## Fageless Replicas

Mannequins are constructs, usually made out of either wood or metal. They are sometimes painted a solid color, but more expensive and well crafted ones may be allowed to show their true material. They have no real facial features. Some have a flat plane instead of a face, while others have a face carved into the head. Even when they appear to have facial features, none of them work, and they are incapable of facial expressions. Due to their lack of a mouth, they speak with a basic form of telepathy.

While most resemble humans in form and build, they can be constructed to resemble any medium-sized humanoid race, from elves to dragonborn. The race they resemble will reflect the industry they were made to be employed in and what race they mostly sold to. Some mannequins have multiple interchangeable head casings that they can wear to resemble different races.

## Stiff yet Graceful

Originally made to sell clothing, mannequins know how to show off whatever they are wearing. When they move, they do so with grace, fluidity and poise, even in the midst of battle or when they are overcome by intense emotion. They are programmed to be careful with the "merchandise" on their bodies, and become extremely distraught if their outfit is damaged or soiled.

---

When mannequins aren't moving, they stand completely still, without the slightest twitch or fluctuation. It can be very difficult for someone who is unfamiliar with the race to tell that it is alive at all before it starts to move. They have incredible patience while holding still and can stay that way for days on end, ignoring slight discomforts and annoyances. When they stand still, they have a habit of striking a graceful pose and holding it as long as they have to.

## Natural Merchants

From the way they move, mannequins may seem to be shallow creatures, but they are highly intelligent in matters of economics and trade. They are experts in selling people things they don't need and getting them to pay more for the things they do need. This expertise also helps them when they are on the buying end of a transaction, making them effective hagglers and deft at spotting unfair prices and scams. They take great pride in their mercantile prowess. Nothing makes them feel better than a successful sale where everyone leaves happy.

While their opinions on morality can vary from individual to individual, all mannequins have a strict, instinctual code of conduct when it comes to money and possessions. Stealing is the most terrible sin possible from their perspective. Large thefts can throw even the most gentle and good-natured mannequin into a murderous rage.

## Mannequin Names

Mannequins are named by their owners, so their names can follow the pattern of any culture in the world. Often they will lack a family or clan name, or their family or clan name will be based on the store they worked for or the noble family they served. Their names tend to be elegant and trendy. A single mannequin may go through many names in their lifetime.

For mannequin name options, look at the name section for the race of your character's previous owners.

## Mannequin Traits

As a mannequin, the way that you were designed and constructed gives you a variety of traits that you share with other mannequins.

Ability Score Increase. Your Charisma score increases by 2 , and your Dexterity score increases by 1.

Age. Being constructs, mannequins come into the world fully formed. They normally last about 500 years before breaking down.

Alignment. Made to follow orders, most mannequins tend towards lawful neutral. Free mannequins normally have a more chaotic streak in them that pushed them away from their predefined place in life.

Size. Mannequins are often around the same size as humans, although they can be slightly bigger or smaller depending on what race they were modeled after. Their inner mechanisms are too complex to be condensed down to halfling size. Your size is medium.

Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

Living Construct. Even though you were constructed, you are a living creature. You are immune to disease. You do not need to eat or breathe, but you can ingest food and drink if you wish. Instead of sleeping, you enter an inactive state for 4 hours each day. You do not dream in this state; you are fully aware of your surroundings and notice approaching enemies and other events as normal.

Business Sense. Add your proficiency bonus to any Charisma (Persuasion) and Wisdom (Insight) checks related to buying, selling and trading items and services. If you are already proficient, add double your proficiency bonus.

Statuesque. You have the ability to stay unnaturally still. You have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks when you are not moving.

False Face. You are able to use all of your senses and speak normally, despite having no real facial features. You cannot be blinded by non-magical means, except by covering your entire face with an opaque material. You also cannot be deafened by non-magical means except by covering your whole face with a thick material that blocks sound.

Perfect Fit. Whatever you wear magically resizes to fit your body. You may wear armor and clothing made for Small and Large humanoid creatures without having to modify it. When you take armor or clothing off, it will return to its original size.

Languages. You can read, write, and speak Common and one language of your choice.

## RAGIAL AdJUSTMENTS

In this more advanced age, the growing presence of magic and technology has changed the way races interact with their surroundings.

These changes will evolve with the campaign as it goes. Everything you see here is capable of changing in the future.

## DWARVES:

## Hill DWARVES

Many of those that used to be referred to as "hill dwarves" moved on to fill in as intermediaries between the deepdwelling mountain dwarves and the growing "civilized" world. Hill dwarves have become surface dwellers that gain advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks among common folk, but have lessened darkvision, up to 30 feet.

## Mountain DWARVES

Many of the mountain dwarves remained in seclusion within mountainous fortresses. As a result, they have trouble congregating into civilized areas and prefer more natural areas. Their heritage retains the dwarves' 60 foot darkvision.

## Elves:

With the exception of drow and moon elves, adapting to modern technology has left most elves without darkvision, but provided other unique traits instead.

## High Elves

High elves have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks involving eyesight in direct sunlight.

Moon elves have darkvision up to 60 feet in direct moonlight, as long as there are no other light sources within 60 feet. They also have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks in these conditions.

## Wood Elves

Wood elves are likely to have spent most of their time living outside of the "civilized" world. They have adapted to using electrical lighting with modern technology, but still retain an uncanny familiarity with the "uncivilized" world. Thus, they will notice small differences in natural environments and will have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks outside of civilization as long as they can see.

## Drow

All drow were born in the underdark. They retain their 60 feet of darkvision.

The banishment of the drow to the underdark is still in effect, even now. They are a rare sight on the surface world, and are - at the very least - regarded in a suspicious manner. Drow have disadvantage on all Charisma checks if they are recognized as drow.

The few drow that have a reason to leave the underdark know to hide their true identity. A character who plays a surface dwelling drow will have proficiency with the disguise kit. If a class or background would normally grant proficiency with the disguise kit, they gain proficiency with another toolkit of their choice instead (at the DM's discretion).

## GNOMES:

## ROCK GNOMES

"Rock gnomes" are now more commonly known as "Tinker gnomes" as their tinkering typically places them in technological roles. They have advantage on any checks that involve manipulating a mechanical or electric item.

## FORESt GNOMES

Forest gnomes typically avoid the bustle of the cities, instead choosing to hone and maintain their knowledge of the world outside their walls. They have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks outside of civilization as long as they can see.

## Half-Elves

Life spent among modern technology and readily accessible lighting has left half-elves without darkvision.

As half-breeds, half-elves are haunted by the social stigma of their mixed ancestry. Quick thinking and the need to adequately assess social situations has granted them advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks against commoners, but they have disadvantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks against individual who have "racial pride," particularly regarding Elves and Humans.

As half-breeds, half-elves are unable to reproduce.

## Half-ORcs

Orcs can still be found in the modern world as a sentient species, but are more often than not in highly vegetated areas far from civilization, usually farmers or secluded societies.

Half-orcs deal with prejudice similarly to half-elves, but tend to be more feared (usually with good reason). They gain advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks against common folk, but have disadvantage on other Charisma checks against them.

Having distanced themselves from the cities, half-orcs (and Orcs, for that matter) are unlikely to have a major understanding of technology and will have disadvantage on checks involving technology unless they have received training.

Half-orcs tend to be particularly adept at "sizing up" opponents. They may analyze an opponent by rolling a Wisdom (Perception) check contested by the target's Charisma (Deception) to determine its threat level (CR).

As half-breeds, half-orcs are unable to reproduce.

## Tieflings

In "modern" society, sin and vice run rampant. Tieflings are the offspring of demons with humanoid races, and typically are treated as such: children of vice.

Tieflings have disadvantage on all Charisma checks when dealing with "normal" commoners in "normal" situations, but have advantage on all Charisma checks when dealing with individuals of a "shady" nature. This extends to individuals who glorify a life of "sin and vice."

Due to their urban upbringing, surrounded by technology, most Tieflings have never spent time in the dark except when taking their rests. Tieflings still retain their darkvision, but only out to 30 feet.

---

# Classes 

![img-4.jpeg](assets/The%20Homebrewery%20Steampunk_img-4.jpeg)
dditional classes have been added to the universe of Dungeons and Dragons made by content creators and Wizards of the Coast. These are to give players more options when selecting a class to play making in game roleplay and combat a more fun experience.

## ARTIFICER

## By u/ReVLID

A gnome sits hunched by the campfire, carefully using needle and thread to darn a ranger's cloak. As he works, he incorporates tiny runes into the stitch pattern, symbols which emit an ever-brightening glow. Finally the light fades, as the energies channeled by his needle flow into the finished cloth. He grins, and experimentally waves a handful of nothing in the air. He hopes she likes her brand new invisibility cloak.

A troll growls in hunger as it looms over a dwarf. The short girl smiles. One eyelid flickers. She whips a wand from a hidden sheath, and with a thunderous roar blasts the beast with a gout of arcane, twisting flame. The troll's growls turn into shrieks of panic as it turns to flee, and she blows smoke from the tip of her blasting rod.

The half-orc magician sprints down the corridor, panting breathlessly as he flees a scuttling thing with far too many teeth. It screeches as he rounds a corner, certain that it has him pinned. Then a fist of fire-hardened clay smashes into its carapaced head, and it goes reeling as a golem steps forth.

Makers of magic-infused objects, artificers are defined by their inventive nature. Like wizards, they see magic as a complex system waiting to be decoded and controlled through a combination of thorough study and investigation. Artificers, though, focus on creating marvelous new magical objects. Spells are often too ephemeral and abstract for their tastes. Instead, they seek to craft potent items.

## Cunning Inventors

Every artificer is defined by a specific craft or science, which they use as a foundation for their arcane practices. Some artificers are engineers, who develop mechanisms that work in conjunction with magical sigils and patterns. Others are alchemists, focused on the creation of potions and ointments with mystical ingredients. Still others are tailors, sculptors, woodworkers, gemcutters, and even chefs.

To an artificer, magic is not something beyond comprehension, but an ancient and ever-evolving art which should be explored for any number of reasons. Novelty, discovery, power, wealth, and the simple joy of creation all drive artificers onwards.

## Intense Rivalries

The artificers' need to invent and expand their knowledge creates an intense drive to uncover new magic discoveries. Good-aligned artificers recover items on adventures or offer gold or wondrous items to those who possess items they are keen to own. Evil ones have no problem committing crimes to claim what they want.

Almost every artificer has at least one rival, someone whom they seek to outdo at every turn. By the same token, artificers with similar philosophies and theories band together into loose guilds. They share their discoveries and work together to verify their theories and keep ahead of their rivals.

## Greating an Artificer

As you build your artificer character, think about their specialty. What drew them to this craft, and what was the first thing they made? Who was their teacher, and what was their relationship? Do they have a rival, or favor lone research?

What sort of role do artificers play in the setting of your game? Are they isolated geniuses performing dangerous magical research, or the cornerstone of a mighty industry?

Why did you set out adventuring? You might be fleeing a disastrous experiment, in need of funding, searching for an ancient artefact to study, or eager to discover new ingredients and materials for your creations.

How do you relate to your party? Do they value your magical insight and tinkering, or do you meddle to the point of perfectionism? Do you subject your friends to endless minutiae, or closely guard your secrets?

## Quick Build

You can make an artificer quickly by following these suggestions. First, put your highest ability score in Intelligence, followed by Constitution or Dexterity. Second, choose the guild artisan background. Third, choose the mending and prestidigitation cantrips, along with the 1st level spells cure wounds and thunderous smite.

Hit Points at 1st Level: $8+$ your Constitution modifier
Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per artificer level after 1st

---

## ArtifiCER SPECIALTY

At 1st level, you choose your Specialty as a crafter of amazing items. You can choose from Apothecary, Bladesmith, Golemancer, or Wandslinger, all of which are detailed at the end of the class description.

Your choice grants you features at 1st level and again at 3rd, 10th, 14th, and 17th level.

## SPECIALTY TOOLS

Every specialty grants proficiency with a specific set of tools useful to its secret arts. If you are already proficient with these tools, the DM should allow you to choose another.

## Spell Formulae

You are versed in the estoreric magic of an artificer.

## CANTRIPS

You know two cantrips of your choice from the artificer spell list. You learn additional artificer cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Artificer table.

## Spell Slots

The Artificer table shows how many spell slots you have, and what level those slots are; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast an artificer spell of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.

## Spells Known of ist Level and Higher

At 2nd level, you know three 1st-level spells of your choice from the artificer spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Artificer table shows when you learn more artificer spells of your choice. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level.

When you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the artificer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the artificer spell list for which you have spell slots.

Spells learned through other artificer features do not count toward your Spells Known, and cannot be swapped.

## Spellcasting Ability

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your artificer spells. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an artificer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
Spell save $\mathrm{DC}=8+$ your proficiency bonus + your
Intelligence modifier
Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your
Intelligence modifier

## Tool Expert

Also at 1st level, choose two of your tool proficiencies. You double your proficiency bonus for any ability check you make that uses these tool proficiencies.

Beginning at 11th level, this feature applies to all of your tool proficiencies.

## Infuse Magic

Starting at 2nd level, you gain a pool of infusion charges which you can use to create temporary magic items. This pool starts empty, but you can expend a Spell Formulae spell slot to gain charges equal to the slot's level.

All your infusion charges are lost at the end of a short or long rest, whether they are in an item or your pool.

## Infusing Items

You can choose one artificer spell you know of 1st level or higher, and spend 1 minute infusing it into an inanimate object you are touching. Once this process is complete, you transfer any number of infusion charges to the item.

An item can hold a number of charges up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum one) at once. You cannot infuse the same spell into multiple items, or infuse multiple spells into the same item.

## Using Infused Items

A creature with Intelligence 6 or more holding or wearing an infused item can cast its spell with a range of self (or touch, if it targets the infused object), by spending a number of the item's charges equal to the spell's level.

For example, expending a 3rd level Spell Formulae slot offers 3 infusion charges. Infusing these into a cloak with absorb elements allows the wearer to cast that spell three times at 1 st level, or once each at 2 nd and 1 st level.

The spell uses your spellcasting ability, and does not require concentration. The bearer can cast it even if they could not normally cast spells, and the infused item acts as a spellcasting focus for its spell. An infused spell ends early if the bearer casts another infused spell.

## WrightLORE

Also at 2nd level, your understanding of magical craftwork allows you to analyze the secrets of magic items. You learn the spells detect magic and identify, which don't count toward your number of spells known and are artificer spells for you.

You can cast these spells at will, without expending a spell slot or providing any material components.

---

## Wondrous Panoply

At 3rd level, you complete two minor wonders, magical items that only you can use.
Wonders each contain a spell, chosen from the table below, which you can cast without expending spell slots or material components. These spells are cast at their lowest level, and end immediately if they are cast again. If a spell targets one or more creatures, its range becomes self.
You treat spells you can cast using your wonders as artificer spells you know for the purposes of infusion.
If a wonder is stolen or lost, you can remake it during a short or long rest with 1 hour of work and 25 gp of materials.
You complete an additional minor wonder at 7th level. At 5th level, you create a potent wonder, and another at 9th and 13th level. You complete a greater wonder at 11th level, and another at 15 th and 20 th level.
If you wish, your wonder can contain a spell associated with a lower level of item (e.g. a Potent Wonder can contain jump). When you gain an artificer level, you can choose one of your wonders and remake it into another of the same level.

## Wonders Table

Level Spells
Minor alarm, comprehend languages, continual flame, darkvision, detect poison and disease, disguise self, enthrall, grease, jump, illusory script, mage armor, magic mouth, Nystul's magic aura, purify food and drink, silent image, speak with animals, unseen servant, water breathing
Potent any cantrip, alter self, animal friendship, arcane lock, feather fall, feign death, fog cloud, levitate, meld into stone, phantom steed, spider climb, speak with dead, speak with plants, Tenser's floating disk, tongues, water walk
Greater barkskin, detect evil and good, detect thoughts, enhance ability (one effect), expeditious retreat, fly, gust of wind, invisibility, longstrider, nondetection, see invisibility, stinking cloud

## Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2 , or you can increase two scores by 1 . You can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

## Delicate Infusion

Starting at 5th level, when you create an infused item, you can describe a circumstance under which the spell triggers.
The first time that circumstance occurs while the item is held or worn by a valid creature, the infused spell is cast without an action. This consumes charges normally.
For example, you might specify that an item infused with darkvision casts that spell when its wearer is plunged into darkness, consuming two charges.
If you wish, you can instead use an action to set this trigger on one of your wonders.
You must complete a short or long rest before you set another trigger.

## Knick Knacks \& Widgets

You decide the specific form your wonders take, as appropriate to your Artificer Specialty. They could be rune-carved amulets, mechanical contraptions, a belt of potions, or something even stranger. For inspiration, check the list of trinkets on page 160 of the Player's Handbook.

You do not need a separate action to ready a wonder. This is represented by its casting time.

## Talismonger

Beginning at 6th level, you can spend 10 minutes working on an object to end all curses affecting it. If the object is a cursed magic item, its curse remains, but the spell breaks its owner's attunement so it can be removed.
You can also end any spells affecting the object, a process which occupies a number of additional minutes equal to the total combined spell levels of each removed spell.

## Master of Craft

Starting at 11th level, you learn fabricate, which does not count toward your number of spells known and is an artificer spell for you. If you are proficient with appropriate tools (e.g. carpenter's tools for wood) you can cast that spell without expending spell slots.
In addition, you now ignore all class, race, and level requirements for the use of magic items.

## Magnificent Creation

Beginning at 13th level, when you complete a long rest you can choose one of the following spells: arcane gate, forcecage, globe of invulnerability, mordenkainen's magnificent mansion, mordenkainen's magnificent sword, move earth, simulacrum, or symbol.
Once before the end of your next long rest, you can cast this spell as an artificer spell, without expending a spell slot.

## Infusion Surge

Starting at 15th level, you gain infusion charges equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum one) when you complete a short or long rest.
Additionally, you can use a bonus action to supply any number of infusion charges from your infusion pool to an item you have already infused within 60 feet. You must complete a short or long rest before you do so again.

## Spirit of the Muse

At 20th level, you can spend 1 minute to reflect on your designs and ideas. If you do so, you regain all your expended spell slots from your Spell Formulae feature.
Once you regain spell slots with this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.

## ArtifiCER SPECIALTIES

Artificers pursue a variety of specialties, ranging from methods to materials to goals. The wide-ranging hunter who works the bones and hides of his prey into mystical gear is just as much an artificer as the proud architect who reshapes the land to match his geomantic designs.

Some specialties are self-taught, but others are literal schools or guilds, complete with all the support and obligations such an organization offers.
![img-5.jpeg](assets/The%20Homebrewery%20Steampunk_img-5.jpeg)

Apothecary
In a world where the gods will heal their chosen followers of all that ails them, the study of herbs and minerals for restorative properties is sometimes regarded as backwards or even heretical. The apothecary brews regardless, seeking a cure for what ails them.

## SPECIALTY TOOLS

When you choose this specialty at 1st level, you gain proficiency with alchemist's supplies or brewer's supplies.

## Bolstering DraUGHT

Also at 1st level, you learn to temporarily reinforce the vitality of others with a stiffening concoction. You can use your action and touch a creature to grant them temporary hit points equal to $1 \mathrm{~d} 6+$ your Intelligence modifier. These temporary hit points last for 1 hour.

You can choose to catalyze this brew upon applying it, increasing the hit points provided by your artificer level but reducing their duration to one round.

## Potent Curatives

Beginning at 3rd level, if one of your infused spells is used to restore a creature's hit points, grant it temporary hit points, or remove a condition, it regains 4 hit points in addition to any supplied by the spell.

If you know an artificer spell which can restore a creature's hit points, grant it temporary hit points, or remove a condition, you can infuse it into multiple objects at once.

## Hardened Stomach

Starting at 10th level, long experience with various chemicals grants you immunity to disease, poison damage, and the poisoned condition.

In addition, you learn the mass cure wounds spell, which is an artificer spell for you and does not count toward your spells known.

## Devil's Bargain Brew

Beginning at 14th level, when you complete a short or long rest you can administer a special brew to a willing creature within 30 feet. One of the creature's ability scores of your choice increases by +2 , as does its potential maximum in that score. However, it suffers disadvantage on all rolls made with one other ability, also of your choice.

The brew's effects last until you finish a short or long rest.

## Transcendant Alchemy

Starting at 17th level, you can use an action to heal a creature you are touching, magically infusing their internal chemistry. That creature immediately regains all its lost hit points, and you can end one disease or condition afflicting it.

You cannot do so again until you complete a long rest.

## Bladesmith

Hammering away at their forge, the bladesmith labours in pursuit of legends: awesome weapons of incredible power, born from steel and skill. Such artificers often join parties of mighty warriors, for how better to learn a blade's needs?

## SPECIALTY Tools

When you choose this specialty at 1st level, you gain proficiency with smith's tools.

You also gain proficiency with shields, heavy armor, and martial melee weapons.

## Forge Arts

Also at 1st level, you learn to channel the heat of the forge. You learn green-flame blade, which is an artificer cantrip for you and does not count toward your cantrips known.

## Master of the Hammer

Starting at 3rd level, if you know an artificer spell that enhances a melee attack or improves a weapon's qualities (e.g. magic weapon), you can infuse it into multiple separate melee weapons at once.

In addition, you can use a bonus action to reforge a metal weapon you are holding, with the following effects:

- You can change the spell infused into that weapon.
- You can add any number of infusion charges to the item directly from your pool.
- You can transform the weapon into another type of metal weapon (e.g. a shortsword into a greataxe). Magic items revert back into their original form after 1 minute.


## Master of the Anvil

Also at 3rd level, you have +1 AC while wearing metal armor. This does not stack with the Defense Fighting Style.

## Stoke the Forge

At 10th level, you gain resistance to fire damage. You also learn the heat metal spell. This is an artificer spell for you, and does not count toward your spells known.

---

## Sage of Steel

Also at 10th level, if you cast a cantrip on your turn, you can use a bonus action to reforge your weapon and then make a single melee weapon attack with the altered weapon.

## FONT OF BlaDES

At 14th level, you can cast blade barrier without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you do so again.

## FORGE LORD

Beginning at 17th level, you have resistance to non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage while wearing armor made of metal.

## GOLEMANCER

While the creation of life is an ambition for many artificers, most abandon it in favor of more practical pursuits. The golemancer has not, and seeks to perfect the art of crafting a servant with an inexhaustible body and unthinking mind.

## SPECIALTY TOOLS

When you choose this specialty at 1st level, you gain proficiency with potter's tools.

## Construct Servant

Also at 1st level, you create a servant golem from clay and precious stones. This loyal companion uses the traits of an Ape with the following modifications:

- It is a construct instead of a beast.
- It loses the Multiattack action.
- It is immune to being charmed, frightened, exhausted or poisoned, as well as poison damage.
- It has proficiency in all saving throws, and adds its proficiency bonus to its AC and damage rolls.

Your golem can understand your languages, and obeys your commands as best it can. It rolls for initiative like any other creature, but you determine its actions. If you are incapacitated or absent, it acts on its own.

## Better, Stronger, Faster

If you cast mending on your golem, it can spend Hit Dice to regain hit points, just as though it had completed a short rest.

If you actually complete a short rest, your golem regains all of its hit points, as you engage in more mundane yet thorough repairs.

If your golem dies, you can rebuild it during a long rest. This occupies 4 hours of work, and consumes raw materials based on its size: tiny ( 5 gp ), small ( 10 gp ), medium ( 25 gp ), large ( 100 gp ), huge ( 200 gp ).

You can spend 1 minute using your potter's tools to harvest valuable reagents from your destroyed golem (DC 20). If you succeed, this cost is eliminated.

You can also remodel a living golem in a new size. This works similar to rebuilding a golem, but at half the cost.

## AdVANCED SERVITOR

You continuously work to improve your golem's capabilities.

- It uses your proficiency bonus instead of its own.
- It has a number of hit dice equal to your own, and adjusts its maximum hit points accordingly.
- Whenever you gain the Ability Score Improvement class feature, your golem can increase one ability score of your choice by 2 , or two ability scores of your choice by 1 , up to the normal maximum of 20 .

You can rebuild your golem (see the Better, Faster, Stronger sidebar) to be tiny, small, or medium-sized. This adjusts its hit dice, carrying capacity, and so on as normal.

Starting at 5th level, you can build a large golem, and at 11th level you become able to build a huge golem.

## GOLEM PROGRAMMING

Starting at 3rd level, you can use a bonus action to use your golem's senses while it is within 100 feet. While you do so, you can communicate telepathically with your golem.

On your turn, you can use your action to give your golem one of the following commands. It can use its reaction to receive the relevant benefit until the start of your next turn:

- Accelerated Reposition. Your golem immediately moves up to its full speed.
- Guardian Protocols. One creature of your choice benefits from the Dodge action while within 5 feet of your golem.
- Priority Target. Your golem gains advantage on its attack rolls against one creature of your choice.

Alternatively, you can use your action and spend a Spell Formulae spell slot to overclock your golem. It can use its reaction to immediately take an action, in addition to any action it takes or took on its own turn this round.

## WONDROUS AUTOMATON

Starting at 10th level, your golem incorporates a copy of each of your wonders into its body, and can use them in the same manner as yourself. It also counts as a single inanimate object for the purposes of infusion charges.

## HACK CONSTRUCT

Beginning at 14th level, you can cast command at will, as an artificer spell, without expending a spell slot or material components. This spell can only be used to target constructs.

Additionally, you can spend a Spell Formulae spell slot to cast the animate objects spell, as an artificer spell. You must complete a long rest before you do so again.

## MAGICAL MATERIALS

Beginning at 17th level, your golem gains resistance to all damage while you are within 30 feet of it.

---

## WANDSLINGER

All artificers invest themselves in their creations, but the wandslingers are those who obsess over a single tool of destruction, pouring their soul into every minor adjustment. The wandslingers are legendary as wandering warriors, everready to test their blasting rods against a new foe.

## SPECIALTY TOOLS

When you choose this specialty at 1st level, you gain proficiency with woodcarver's tools.

## BlaSting Rod

Also at 1st level, you create a blasting rod, a special wand imbued with destructive magic. You learn the fire bolt cantrip, which is an artificer cantrip for you and does not count toward your number of cantrips known.

If you cast fire bolt through your blasting rod, it inflicts your choice of acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage, and deals additional damage equal to your artificer level.

You can only have a single blasting rod at a time. If your rod is lost or destroyed, you can make a new one during a long rest with 50 gp of materials and 4 hours of work.

## FoGUS BlaST

Starting at 3rd level, if you cast fire bolt through your blasting rod and miss, you can use a bonus action to cast it again at the same target.

## Blast Essence

Beginning at 10th level, you learn to properly shape volatile energies. As an action while holding your blasting rod, you can project an area of destructive magic from yourself.

Each creature in that area must make a saving throw against your artificer spell save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes damage as if struck by fire bolt, as well as possibly suffering additional effects based on the blast. You do not add your artificer level to the damage from this blast. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and does not suffer additional effects.

You choose one of the following shapes when you reach 10th level, and select another at 14th and 17th level:

- Diffused Blast. You project a 15 -foot cone of concussive energy. Each creature in its area must succeed a Strength saving throw or be pushed 10 feet away.
- Explosive Blast. Your energy bursts in a 10 -foot radius sphere centered on a point you can see within 120 feet. Each creature in its area must succeed a Constitution saving throw to withstand the blast.
- Piercing Blast. You project a searing beam in a 50 foot long, 1 foot wide line. Each creature in its area must make a Dexterity saving throw, receiving no benefit from half or three-quarters cover.


## Infused Blast

Also at 10th level, when you use the Blast Essence feature you can spend a Spell Formulae spell slot, or five infusion charges, to alter the shapes in the following ways:

- Diffused Blast. The size of the cone increases to 60 feet, and it inflicts an extra 2 d 10 damage.
- Explosive Blast. The radius of the sphere increases to 30 feet, and it inflicts an extra 2 d 10 damage.
- Piercing Blast. The length of the line increases to 150 feet, and it inflicts an extra 2 d 10 damage.


## Swift Wand

Beginning at 14th level, when you roll initiative and are not surprised, you gain a special turn that takes place before other creatures can act.

If more than one creature in an encounter has such a feature, they all act first in order of initiative, then the regular initiative order begins.

On this turn, you can move, ready your blasting rod, and use your rod to cast fire bolt or project a shape. You cannot take any other actions or a bonus action.

## Disintegration Blast

At 17th level, you can use your blasting rod to cast disintegrate as a 9th level spell, without expending a spell slot. You must complete a long rest before you do so again.
![img-6.jpeg](assets/The%20Homebrewery%20Steampunk_img-6.jpeg)

I Do Not Aim With My Eye
In settings more comfortable with guns as part of their aesthetic, the Wandslinger can be replaced with the Gunsmith. This specialty works in the exact same way, except that it uses a personalized arcane firearm in place of a blasting rod.

You can assume that the verbal component of fire bolt is replaced by the gun's loud retort.

Similarly, it is possible to reflavour a Golemancer as a Roboticist: this version of the Artificer is more magical than mechanical, but play what suits you.

## u/ReVlid's Design Notes

This take on the Artificer class is designed to fill the niche of a support caster. It provides many of the same features as the Unearthed Arcana Artificer, but is intended to allow more flexibility and a clearer focus.

## Cracked Magic

The Artificer uses short rest spell slots, much like the Warlock's Pact Magic, but its ability to convert slots into infusion charges allows it to use preparation and forethought to supply buffs more flexibly and efficiently.

The lack of concentration on these spells means Barbarians can use them, and allows Searing Smite and similar spells to be cast without interrupting the wielder's own concentration. This is not without precedent; potions allow the same thing.

The Artificer spell list is limited to those spells which enhance the character who casts them or the object they're stored in, to let Artificers create a cloak of invisibility or a potion of cure wounds.

This class' higher level features are roughly balanced against the Warlock's Mystic Arcana spells.

## At Willworking

The Artificer has a limited number of spell slots. Even when parceling them out into infusion charges, the Artificer will mostly be giving control of the spell to another character. This limits the agency its players can exercise.

Therefore the Artificer comes with a great range of at will spells, which it can use for out-of-combat utility without expending any resources. These include features like Wrightlore, as well as access to custom Wonders.

In combat, an Artificer is more likely to rely on their subclass (or Specialty), which supplies their turn-by-turn combat features. A Golemancer commands her golem, a Wandslinger blasts his enemies, and so on.

## Artificial Flavour

This version of the class eschews mechanical or clockpunk flavour in favour of a "magical artisan" theme. This makes it usable in a much broader range of settings, but as noted elsewhere in this document, can easily be replaced.

The Artificer does not create literal magic items, which are dependent on the setting and campaign, hard to balance, and can be lost or consumed. Instead, it emulates them with its Wondrous Panoply and temporary infusions.

## The Drawing Board

So that's it: the Artificer is a short-rest caster focused on buffs, capable of creating temporary magic items with a little prep-time, festooned with magical gizmos, and specialized in a particular craft they can employ on adventures.

I'm interested in any and all feedback. Let me know what you think, and let me know if you play with this class!

## Multiclassing

Whether learning treasure-hunting skills from a rogue or focusing on magical theory as a wizard, artificers can benefit from multiclassing as much as any adventurer. The details are as follows:

## Artificer Multiclass Prerequisites

Ability Score Minimums: Intelligence 13

## Artificer Multiclass Proficiencies

Light armor, medium armor, two tools

## Artificer Multiclass Spell Formulae

If you gain warlock levels as a artificer (or vice versa), add together all your warlock levels and all your artificer levels, and use the Warlock table to determine your number and level of Pact Magic spell slots. You can use these interchangeably with Spell Formulae spell slots.

## Artificer Feats

The Magic Initiate, Ritual Caster, and Spell Sniper feats (along with other feats that allow a character to learn spells) add the artificer spell list to those that can be chosen from. Artificer spells use Intelligence as their spellcasting ability.

## Custom Build

If you want to add your own material to this class, you're absolutely welcome! The most obvious areas are the spell list, the choice of Wondrous Panoply spells, and the Specialties.

Artificer Spells. The only restriction on Artificer spells is that they should enhance the caster or an object in their possession. Try to imagine a magic item that has this effect.

Wondrous Panoply. Spells suitable for the Wondrous Panoply cannot inflict damage or restore health, and probably shouldn't require a saving throw on the part of the victim. Always consider what would happen if a PC could cast that spell over and over, every turn.

Artificer Specialties. An Artificer's Specialty should focus on what they make, how they make it, or what it's made from.

The Specialty should also provide the Artificer with something they can do every turn in combat. The Apothecary can bolster its allies, the Bladesmith can attack with martial weapons, the Golemancer can support its golem, and the Wandslinger can blast its enemies at range.

- At 1st level, the Artificer gets a tool proficiency, and the central focus for its turn-by-turn play.
- At 3rd level, that central focus should be improved and refined, its gaps filled. Make this cool: it's the last Specialty feature the Artificer will receive for a while.
- As a reward for sticking around until 10th level, the Artificer gets a hefty (and flexible) boost to its focus.
- 14th level is something of a breather, offering an oddball feature that sits orthogonal to the rest of the Specialty.
- 17th level is equivalent to a single specific 9th level spell, cast once per long rest.

## Card Master

Running forward with his cloak billowing behind him, a human draws three cards from his deck - one green, one red, one orange. Once within range, he throws the cards forward. Each card strikes a different target, embedding into the flesh like a razor blade. An orc becomes wreathed by flame, another covered in acid, and the last one collapses and lets out screams of agonizing pain.

Pulling out an intricately crafted card embedded with gold, he lifts his hand into the air. He speaks a single word, and the card glows a blindly bright gold. All around him, meteors fall from the sky, exploding into giant balls of flame and light.

With eyes closed and a hand over mouth a woman shivers in terror, having witnessed the death of the men around her. The card master calmly picks up his dealt cards and says to her coolly, "Ma'am, I sure am lucky but not everyone around me can say the same. I recommend you get on outta here before you're next to have your fate dealt." With a toothy grin and tip of his hat he walks away, the woman falling to her knees in terror.

Spinning a gold coin in his hands, the human clears his mind and focuses on the cards in front of him imagining he's playing with other players. With a deft wriggle of the fingers, the man pushes all his money into his pocket, and with a weary smile flips his cards over, showing a winning hand. Despite having lady luck on his side, he never truly feels lucky to have done any harm to anyone.

## A Means to What End?

Card masters are the practitioners of an ancient mystical art that relies on magical cards. Card masters piece together collections of their cards, or decks, which they draw from in order to cast spells. Utilizing the power stored in these collections, card masters can conjure fiery explosions, flashy illusions, arcane lightning, and many other spectacular sights.

The card masters' uncanny ability to manipulate the weave of magic and the people around them with cards alone leads them to do amazing things. Whether stealing money from unsuspecting victims, offering mercenary service, or simply drifting from tavern to tavern to gamble, a card master must decide whether their gift should be used for good or ill. Many are nomads, traveling the world and searching for wealth and fame, using their mystical card magic to get an edge over everyone else. Others look within themselves, focusing on their ability to manipulate the world through magic over nights of endless study.

In combat, a card master focuses on supporting their allies and weakening their enemies through strategic use of their cards. When push comes to shove, a card master always has a trick up their sleeve, and can unleash some powerful spells to keep their enemies at bay, before fleeing, enthralling or finishing off their enemies.

## Collectors of the Arcane

A card master is defined by their collection of magical cards. As they travel and adventure throughout the world, a card master will either create or find cards to add to their collection. When two card masters cross paths, they also can trade or copy cards from each others' collections, with the eventual goal of creating a vast collection of cards that they can choose to put into their deck.

Using Card Magic is much harder than it looks. While a creature unfamiliar with card magic may think all that card masters need to do is to throw their magical cards and hope for the best, even beginning a path as a card master takes years of practice and countless hours of study.

## Greating a Card Master

Creating a card master requires access to at least a small starter set of cards. How did your character find these cards? Did you have a master you learned from? Did you find them in a ancient ruin, and then experimented with them until you figured out how to use them? Did you have natural talent, or did it come slowly to you after years of practice?

What causes you to start adventuring? Are you on a quest to add to your collection? Have you taken on an apprentice to whom you are teaching your art? Or perhaps you simply wish to put your newfound power to the test.

## Quick Build

You can make a card master quickly by following these suggestions. First, Charisma should be your highest ability score, followed by Dexterity or Constitution. Second, choose the Charlatan background. Third, choose card throw, minor illusion, and light as your cantrips, and add the following spell cards to your collection: burning hands, color spray, disguise self, false life, ray of sickness, and shield.

## Class Features

As a Card Master, you gain the following class features:

## Hit Points

Hit Dice: 1d8 per Card master level
Hit Points at 1st Level: $8+$ your Constitution modifier
Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per Card master level after 1st

## ProFigiengies

## Armor: Light armor

Weapons: Simple weapons, sidearms and firearms with the scatter property
Tools: One gaming set of playing cards
Saving Throws: Intelligence, Charisma
Skills: Choose two from Acrobatics, Arcana, Deception, History, Intimidation, Investigation, and Sleight of Hand

## EQUIPMENT

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

- (a) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (b) any simple weapon or (c) a primitive firearm and 20 rounds
- (a) a scholar's pack or (b) a dungeoneer's pack
- leather armor, a playing card set, and two daggers

---

## Card Magic

At 1st level you know the card throw cantrip as detailed at the end of the class description, and two other cantrips of your choice from the card master spell list. You learn additional card master cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Card Master table.

## Your Card Collection

At 1st level, you have a collection of of six 1st-level card master spell cards of your choice. Your card magic is intrinsically tied to having these cards in your possession; a card master's collection must be kept complete and in good condition at all times.

## Adding Cards of ist Level and Higher

Each time you gain a card master level, you can add two additional card master spell cards of your choice to your collection. Each of these spell cards must be a spell from the card master spell list whose level is no higher than your card level.

Additionally, over the course of your adventuring career, you may stumble across additional cards, even possibly encountering other card masters to trade cards with. Finally, if you encounter a spell written in a scroll or spell book, you can scribe it onto a blank spell card using the same rules as that of a wizard's spellbook.

## Preparing a Degk

The Card Master table shows two attributes related to the cards you use: hand size and deck size. The table also shows the level of cards in your deck; all of your cards are of the same level.

The cards in your deck determine the spells you will be able to cast, therefore, you must prepare your deck beforehand. To do so, choose a number of spell cards in your collection equal to your deck size, shown in the Card Master table. For each card you choose, you can add one, two, three, or four copies of the card to your deck. Add cards this way until you reach your maximum deck size.

You can prepare your deck with different cards whenever you complete a long rest.

## Drawing a Hand

As an action, you can draw a hand of cards from your deck. In order to cast one of your spells of 1 st level or higher, you must have the corresponding card in your hand. You cast the spell at the level indicated by your card level.

Once you cast a spell in your hand, that spell card is discarded. Discarded spell cards may not be used again until you draw a new hand. You are able to draw a new hand whenever you finish a short or long rest.

## Spellcasting Ability

Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your card master spell, as card magic is fueled by sheer force of will. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a card master spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

Spell save DC $=8+$ your Proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

Spell attack modifier = your Proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

Your cards themselves serve as your arcane focus.

## Implied Odds

At 1st level, your proficiency in card magic has made you unnaturally lucky and precise. Your spell attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 . Additionally, whenever a creature rolls a 1 on a save against one of your spell, the spell score a critical hit on that creature.

## PATH OF MASTERY

When you reach 2nd level, you choose a path of mastery, shaping your path through one of two specializations: the Gambler and the Master of Luck, each detailed at the end of the class description.

You choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th.

## Luck of the Draw

At 3rd level, your gifts in card magic allow you to gain an even greater advantage when things go well for you. Choose one of the following options:

Quick Draw. Whenever you score a critical hit with one of your spells, you can move up to your speed as part of the action used to cast the spell.

Two of a Kind. Whenever you score a critical hit with one of your spells, your first spell attack on your next turn has advantage on the attack roll and +1 to the damage roll.

Under the Gun. Whenever you score a critical hit with one of your spells, you get a +3 bonus to your AC until the start of your next turn.

## Simulating Cards with Dice

To simulate drawing a hand of cards from the deck with dice, you can assign each of the spell cards in your deck a number. Then roll the appropriate die based on your deck size, adding the spell card that you rolled to your hand. Note the card you have added to your hand, then repeat this process until you have added a number of spell cards to your hand equal to your hand size.

For example, if you are a 5 th level Card Master, you first assign each of the ten cards in your deck a number, 1-10. If you assigned the spell scorching ray the value of 3 and then end up rolling a 3 on your d10, then you add scorching ray to your hand. When you cast scorching ray, you cast it at 3rd level, then that card is discarded.

---

## Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2 , or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

## Legendary Card

At 11th level, you are given a Legendary Card. When you first acquire your Legendary Card, choose a 6th-level spell from the card master spell list, adding that spell to your Legendary Card. Your legendary card is separate from your other cards and cannot be added to your deck.

You can cast a spell added to your Legendary Card once without needing to draw it. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.

At higher levels, you gain more Card Master spells of your choice that can be cast in this way: one 7th-level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th level and one 9th-level spell at 17th level. You regain all uses of your Legendary Card when you finish a long rest.

## Card Trick

Starting at 20th level, when you roll for initiative and have no spell cards in your hand, you can draw one spell card.

## Path of Mastery

The card master's specializations come in two flavors - the Gambler and the Master of Luck.

## The Gambler

As a Gambler, you specialize in the art of risk-taking. You become skilled in calculating the risk versus the reward in every action you take, and you gain abilities that are both very risky and very powerful. Those who follow this specialization are often charismatic daredevils and entertainers that take pride in the flashy, high-risk plays that mark this path.

## Reckless Spell

Starting when you choose this path at 2nd level, you can choose to cast one of your card master spells recklessly. When you do so, if the spell requires an attack roll, that roll is made with advantage; if it requires a saving throw, that save is made with disadvantage.

However, whenever you use this ability, you must succeed on a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the spell backfires and you take 1d6 force damage per level of the spell you cast. The DC of this saving throw is equal to $12+$ the level of the spell cast.

## Life's Gambit

At 6th level, when you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can choose to drop to 1 hit point instead. However, if the creature that reduced you to 0 hit points is not killed before the end of your next turn, you are automatically reduced to 0 hit points.

Once you use this feature you can't use it again until you complete a short or long rest.

## Tip the Scales

Starting at 10th level, whenever you make an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can choose to roll an additional 1d10 after seeing the results of your roll. If the number rolled on the d10 is even, then you add the number of your roll. If the number if odd, you instead subtract the number from the roll.

## Deal with Death

At 14th level, whenever another creature you can see makes an attack roll, you can use your reaction to roll 3d4 and apply the result as a penalty to the creature's roll. However, if the attack still hits, the same number is applied as a bonus to the attack's damage.

## Master of Luck

As a Master of Luck, the odds seem to unnaturally swing in your favor. You gain a multitude of abilities and skills that cause life to just go your way, such as better card draws, more precise attacks, and uncanny escapes from danger. Those who follow this aspiration often become thieves and adventurers, allowing their luck alone to carry them through the day.

## Lucky Escape

Starting when you choose this path at 2nd level, you gain the ability to effortlessly escape from your enemies due to luck alone. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns to take the Disengage action.

## Re-Draw

At 6th level, whenever you score a critical hit, you can choose to discard one of the cards in your hand. If you do so, you then immediately draw another card from your deck and add it to your hand.

## Uncanny Precision

Starting at 10th level, your spell attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 18-20. Additionally, whenever a creature rolls a 1 or 2 on a save against one of your spells, the spell scores a critical hit on that creature.

## ScRY

Starting at 14th level, you can use your complete mastery of card magic to cast directly from your deck, without relying on the luck of the draw. As an action on your turn, you may draw a card of your choice from your deck and then immediately cast it.

You can use this feature up to two times. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

# Gunslinger 

A human finishes loading rounds into her gun and and runs straight into a pack of angry kobolds that are threatening her town. She tumbles and spins, her weapon burping out salvo after salvo of hot lead against the poorly armed draconians with naught but simple spears to use against her.

Setting his perch up at the top of a tree, a half-elf begins to train the custom built sights of his homemade rifle on his prize. Amidst the roaming herd of goblins and hobgoblins, there stands a single, massive fire giant shouting commands to the monsters near the edge of a cliff. As he lets out a haughty guffaw, the half-elf sees his opening. His lips curl into a grin, and he pulls the trigger.

A band of orcs move in and surround a tiefling and her disarmed friends, calling for their surrender. Undeterred, the tiefling turns her steely gaze to the firearms within her hands, and imbues them with a mysterious arcane force. Suddenly, she starts to twirl about, firing a multitude of magically charged shots towards her now baffled foes.

Be they outlaws from a distant land trying to redeem themselves, swashbucklers with an eye for the explosive, or smiths that wish to show off their talents to the world in the heat of battle, gunslingers come from many backgrounds, but all have one thing in common. They're all very good with guns, and use unique fighting styles and speed to strike down any foe that challenges them with less advanced weaponry.

## Using Unique Weapons With Style

Though this is heavily dependent on the adventure being run, guns are considered very rare in most adventures, and few know how to operate them. Their exotic nature can lead to confusion and panic among those at the business end of these tools. Gunslingers take advantage of this and combine the usage of these guns with a stylistic grace and speed very few can comprehend. A Gunslinger will take nearly any opportunity they feel appropriate to show off with their weapons of choice, and as they hone their skills with these distributors of supersonic lead death, they become speedy, nearly impossible to track and able to hit a target with their guns under nearly impossible circumstances.

## Born for Adventure

Most adventurers seek adventure out. Others have it thrust upon them. Gunslingers seem to have been born with a natural affinity and curiosity for exploration and dealing with the problems out in the wild. You'll find them at the job board before any paladin or fighter, and they'll be eager to take on the challenges of the darkest and most dangerous dungeons. The more challenging the encounter, the greater use they'll get out of their pride and joy.

## Creating a Gunslinger

When creating a gunslinger, consider two major things. Firstly, consider how rare guns are in the adventure your DM is running, and then consider how your character came across their knowledge of how to make and use them? Did they have a eureka moment in a time of renaissance? Did they train with a mentor before deciding to go on their own path? Or did they form a pact with a dark entity for this knowledge? Either way, their background should lead them to come across these deadly tools for use in their adventures.

If anything, your weapon fills you with more courage than even the angriest barbarian or the most stalwart paladin. Starting at 1st level when you choose this class, you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened. If you are frightened, you can spend an action to gaze down at your firearm if you have it drawn, instilling you with a nearly supernatural courage, ending the effect on yourself and gaining temporary hit points equal to $1 \mathrm{~d} 8+$ your gunslinger level.

---

## Gun Tactics

At 1st level, you adopt a tactic with your guns that emphasizes your unique skill with them. You can't take a gun tactic more than once, even if you get the option to choose again.

## Akimbo Shooting

When wielding two light firearms, you can add your ability score modifier to the damage of the second attack. You can reload both light firearms at once using a bonus action.

## SNIPER

If you make an attack with a two-handed firearm beyond 30 feet, you get a +2 bonus to damage rolls. The firearm cannot have the scatter property in order to gain this benefit.

## Basic Gun Stunts

Gunslingers learn unique skills that set them apart from anyone else who can point and shoot a gun. At 2nd level, you can perform various different daring feats with your firearms. You can use the following abilities during your turn.

Analytical Shot. You can use a bonus action to train your firearm's sights on a creature's vitals before you fire. When you do, you can use your Intelligence modifier, instead of your Dexterity modifier, when making an attack roll.

Additionally, you can use your firearms to make opportunity attacks at enemies who have moved out of melee range, if you have the ammunition to do so.

---

## LUCKY ITEM

When you reach 3rd level, the personal effect you chose at 1st level, such as a cigar, a trench coat or a ten gallon hat, has become a defining aspect of your personality. Choose from one of the following traits below. If your lucky item is lost or destroyed, it mysteriously reappears on you at the end of your next long rest. You cannot choose the Gunslinging Trail specific Lucky Item options until 13th level.

## Ability Score Improvement

## OVERWATCH

At 5th level, you can use an action to go into overwatch, lying in wait to fire upon against an enemy given the slightest opening. While in overwatch, you can make an opportnity attack against any enemy that moves, attacks, or casts a spell in your firearm's normal range (i.e. 30 feet for a firearm with range 30/90) if you have the ammunition to do so. You cannot use Basic Gun Stunts or Advanced Gun Stunts in conjunction with this feature. When an enemy is hit by one of these opportunity attacks, it suffers the following penalties:

- If the creature is moving, its speed is halved until the end of your next turn.
- If the creature is making an attack roll, the attack is made with disadvantage.
- If the creature is casting a spell, any creatures targeted by the spell have advantage on saving throws to resist the spell.


## BULLETSTORM

At 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once when you take the attack action on your turn. This can only be done with firearms if they have at least one round left in them.

The number of these attacks increases to 2 at 20th level, but you can only make the third attack with a firearm.

You ignore the reload action or loading time for firearms when and only when making a bulletstorm attack.

## BULLET Time

At 7th level, your reflexes are as fast as any bullet you fire from your gun. You can now take the Dodge action using a bonus action. While dodging, the damage you take from ranged weapon attacks is reduced by half.

Additionally, when you make a Dexterity saving throw to take half damage from a damaging effect, such as a shotgun's scattering shells or a black dragon's acid breath, you take no damage on a successful save and only half damage on a failed save.

## IRON Intuition

Gunslingers pride themselves as being folks who can tell an honest person from a cheat from a mile away. The strange weapons in their holsters also give them an air of someone who can deal with many dangers. At 7th level, you can spend one minute talking to a creature or observing it to glean knowledge on their tics to gain advantage on any Insight checks to discern intent or disposition on any topic. You can also use your Intelligence instead Wisdom for your Insight roll modifier. You can spend ten minutes gathering info about a creature to gain this benefit, so long as there are a few people who know at least basic information on them.

Additionally, when you make Wisdom (Perception), Intelligence (Investigation), or Intelligence (History) checks involving firearms, double your proficiency bonus for those checks.

## Shootout Sense

Gunslingers live for the possibility of danger at any moment. At 10th level, you get advantage on initiative rolls. If you are surprised, you can take your turn as normal, but must use your action to go into overwatch.

---

## Advanced Gun Stunts

At 11th level, you get access to new and more advanced gun stunts. When you use an Advanced Gun Stunt as your bonus action, you can also use a Basic Gun Stunt as part of that bonus action. Alternatively, you can now use two Basic Gun Stunts at once as a bonus action.

Expert Shot. When you use Analytical Shot, you can then add half your Dexterity modifier to the first attack roll you make during your turn as part of that bonus action if you have not already used another Advanced Gun Stunt during your turn. If your Dexterity modifier is higher than your Intelligence modifier, then add half your Intelligence modifier instead.

Luck of the Craft. You can reroll one failed ranged attack roll with a firearm.

Marksman's Stance. When you attack with a longarm, you can draw a sidearm and fire again at any target of your choosing as a bonus action. You do not add your Dexterity modifier to the damage of this attack, unless your modifier is negative. You can use the sidearm to make a bulletstorm attack if you have not done so already with your two-handed firearm. You must holster either the sidearm or the twohanded firearm afterwards as part of the bonus action.

Powershot. You can use a bonus action to concentrate your shots onto your target's center of mass. The first attack you hit with on your turn now deals extra damage equal to half your gunslinger level (rounded down). This raises your gun's misfire number by 1 , to a maximum of 10 .

Vital Strike. You can spend a bonus action to decrease your firearm attack critical hit number by 3 . If you do this, your gun's misfire number goes up by 1 , to a maximum of 10 . Additionally, if you score a critical hit, your attack deals extra damage equal to half your gunslinger level.

- If a creature is moving, its speed drops to 0 and it can't take reactions until the end of your next turn.
- If the creature is making an attack roll, it deals half damage if it hits.
- If the creature is casting a spell or making an area of effect attack, it deals no damage to creatures that succeed the saving throw to resist it, and half damage to creatures that fail the saving throw.


## Final Stand

Starting at 15th level, when your hit points are brought to 0 and you do not die outright, you can, once per long rest, enter a state of pure grit in order to keep fighting on before death takes you. You fall prone and can draw any firearm you wish without using an action. You can only reload or use Basic Gun Stunts as a bonus action, and take the attack action with your weapon. You can only move 5 feet while in final stand, and you cannot Dash or stand up. You make death saving throws at the end of your turns while in final stand.

If you manage to kill a creature or roll a natural 20 on an attack roll while in final stand, you regain hit points equal to $1 \mathrm{~d} 8+$ your gunslinger level and can use your reaction to stand up, a surge of adrenaline and stamina throwing you up on your feet so you can dive back into the fray, guns blazing.

## Gunslinging Supreme

By the time you reach 20th level, you have become an undisputed expert with firearms. Add your proficiency bonus to your firearm's damage rolls, except when in final stand or making an attack that does not apply your ability score modifier to its damage. (For example, making an offhand attack with a light firearm, or using Six-Gun Ace's bonus action attacks.)

Additionally, if you use a gun's automatic or burst fire action, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.

## Multiclassing

In order to multiclass as a Gunslinger, you must have a minimum Dexterity and Intelligence ability score of 13.

Proficiencies Gained: Light armor, medium armor, longarms, sidearms, tinker's tools or smith's tools

## Gunslinging Trails

At 3rd level, gunslingers begin to distinguish themselves by focusing on various principles of gunfighting. This choice is less like classical training and more like a lifestyle decision, dictating how they will conduct themselves for the rest of their adventuring life. You may choose from the Myth Breaker, Virtuoso, or Spellshooter trails. These principles grant you various features to enhance your gunslinging ability to legendary levels.

---

## MYth Breaker

Myth Breakers specialize in using their firearms to hunt down the most dangerous of beasts. They hunt down anything from ancient dragons and beholders with extreme precision and skill. Determined and well researched in a variety of lore, myth breakers are experts in hunting down that which makes the average person tremble in fear.

## Slayer's Specialization

Beginning at 3rd level, you have become a veritable encyclopedia of knowledge on nearly any nasty creature. You can spend 10 minutes reading through your notes or recalling information from your own experiences and knowledge about a single creature. You can make an Intelligence (Arcana) check as a bonus action while in combat to recall this information if you do not know it offhand. The DC for this check is equal to the challenge rating of the creature.

When you recall these details, you immediately learn the creature's vulnerabilities, immunities and resistances. You also learn any special effects triggered when the target takes damage, such as radiant damage halting its regeneration. You also learn any special abilities it has or the most powerful spell that the creature knows, if applicable. Once you use this feature as a bonus action, you cannot use it again until you complete a short or long rest.

## Myth Breaker's Tactics

When you reach 3rd level, you can choose from one of the following tactics that help you slay various monstrosities.

Crowd Control. Your quick trigger finger lends itself well to killing hordes of creatures. Once per turn, when a ranged weapon attack you make with a firearm hits a creature, you can make an additional attack against a creature that's within 5 feet of it and within normal range of your firearm.

Legendary Buster. The crack of your gun is a symbol of teamwork as you mark powerful targets for death. When a ranged weapon attack you make with a firearm hits a creature that has successfully damaged you or creatures friendly to you within the last round, the next weapon attack made against the same creature by an ally deals an extra 1d8 damage on a hit.

Leviathan Feller. Your skill with a gun can send big monstrosities reeling. When a ranged weapon attack you make with a firearm hits a creature that's Large or larger, you can stagger them back 10 feet from you in the direction you hit them. This forced movement can only be applied once per turn.

Varmint Slayer. You have a knack for landing precision shots that help you hit small or dodgy pests. Once per turn, you can get advantage on a single ranged attack with your firearm targeting a creature whose size is smaller than yours that have moved further than 20 feet, or any creature that has moved at least 30 feet or has taken the disengage action before your turn.

Wing Clipper. Flying creatures are no match for your expertly placed shots. If a ranged weapon attack you make with a firearm, a creature that is airborne, either as a result of flying or a spell's effect, or has jumped, climbed or fallen before your turn, your attack deals an extra 1d8 damage to them. You can only deal this extra damage once per turn.

When you reach 9th level, you can learn one of the following defensive tactics that add to your monster hunting skillset.

Critter Sense. Your dedication to tracking small pests has allowed you to develop senses to help hunt them down. You gain 30 feet of blindsight and tremorsense, and creatures that are small or tiny cannot get advantage on attack rolls or benefit from being hidden or invisible while within range of these senses, as long as you are not incapacitated.

Gargantuan Reinforcement. You are stalwart in the face of colossal dangers. You get proficiency in Strength saving throws.

Mob Runner. Creatures that crowd upon you find it quite hard to kill you. When a hostile creature makes an attack against you while another hostile creature is within 5 feet of you or it, the creature makes the attack with disadvantage.

Mythical Guardian. When keeping track of legendary creatures, your hunter's senses heighten your defense. You get a +4 bonus to AC when you go into overwatch.

Skywatch. You always keep your eyes to the sky, making airborne ambushes difficult. When a creature that is flying, either because of wings or a spell's effect, or has fallen, climbed, or jumped before your turn makes an attack roll against you, it makes it with disadvantage. If the attack hits, you can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against you.

You also learn one additional Gun Tactic when you reach this level, having honed your own gunslinging craft to keep up with having to track down and kill such a wide variety of mythical creatures.

## Strength In Knowledge

At 13th level, you have augmented your mind and strengthen your resolve against the horrors out in the great beyond. You get advantage on saving throws against being charmed by creatures you have researched using Slayer's Specialization. In addition, when you use your Slayer's Specialization on a particular type of creature for the first time, you get advantage on attack rolls and saving throws against it the next time you encounter it. This benefit fades after the fight has ended.

## Legendary Overwatch

When you reach 17th level, you are able to stop the most fearsome creatures right in their tracks with nothing but your bullets. If you make a successful overwatch attack against a creature, you can make it suffer the following effects:

- If the creature is moving, it is stunned until the end of your next turn.
- If the creature is making an attack roll, it automatically fails that attack roll and cannot make any more attacks until the end of your next turn.
- If it is casting a spell or forcing a creature or creatures to make a saving throw, the spell or area of effect attack automatically fails, dealing no damage if it would normally do so. If the creature was casting a spell, the spell slot is wasted.

Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you complete a short or long rest.

---

# Virtuoso 

Virtuosos don't see guns as just a mere tool of destruction, they see them as an art form that they wish to master. Those who chose to train as virtuosos collect and train with as many guns as possible in to become more versatile and powerful shooters whose skill and showmanship is unrivaled.

## The Art of Lead

Superiority Dice Improvements. Superiority dice turn into d10s at 9th level and d12s at 17 th level.

Saving Throws. Some of your Tricks require your target to make a saving throw to resist the trick's effects. The save DC is calculated as follows:

Trick Save DC $=8+$ your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity, Intelligence, or Charisma modifier, whichever is highest.

## Head In The Game

At 9th level, you are constantly on top of your game, and are always ready for action. You can use a single Basic Gun Stunt once per turn without using a bonus action. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you complete a short or long rest.

Your mind also becomes a bastion for quick thinking and creativity. You get proficiency in Intelligence saving throws.

Additonally, once per long rest, when you are reduced to 0 HP, you can channel your inherent luck and focus to fly in the face of death itself. You can expend any number of superiority die to roll them and regain hit points equal to the result + your Constitution modifier.

## Skilled \& Witty

Starting at 13th level, you have become an epitome of expertise and sheer skill, both on and off the battlefield. You learn two additional skills, tools, or languages of your choice. Alternatively, you can choose one skill or tool you have proficiency in. Double your proficiency bonus for checks made using that skill.

Additionally, you get advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) and Charisma (Intimidation) checks when trying to defuse a fight.

---

## TRICK PRODIGY

At 17th level, you regain 1 superiority die if you roll initiative and have no superiority dice remaining.

Additionally, choose a single trick you know. You can now use this trick once per long rest without spending a superiority die.

Finally, you can use a single Advanced Gun Stunt once per turn without using a bonus action. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you complete a long rest.

## Virtuoso Tricks

These tricks will be listed in alphabetical order.
Bleeding Attack. When you make a successful weapon attack, you can expend a superiority die to cause the creature to begin bleeding from the wound. The target of your attack takes necrotic damage equal to the number your roll your superiority die for a number of turns equal to your Dexterity or Intelligence modifier, whichever is higher. They take this damage on the beginning of their turns. They can make a Constitution saving throw in order to halve this damage.

Creatures that do not bleed are not affected by this trick, and simply suffer extra damage equal to your superiority die + half your gunslinger level (rounded down).

Break Cover. You can expend a superiority die to attack a creature that has cover. Treat three-quarters cover as half cover, and half cover as no cover for this attack. You can also attack a creature in total cover as long as you are aware of them, but you have disadvantage on the attack roll and the target is treated as if it had three-quarters cover. If the attack hits, you add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll.

If this is done to a creature that has been swallowed by another creature, instead the creature that swallowed it takes the normal damage you deal with this attack, and the creature inside takes damage equal to the number rolled on your superiority die.

Concussive Attack. When you make a successful weapon attack, you can expend a superiority die to cause your target to be discombobulated. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and the next attack the target makes has disadvantage.

Defensive Stance. When you make more than one attack with your firearms, you can expend a superiority die to go into a stance that makes you a harder target to hit as you take shot after shot against your enemies. Roll the superiority die and add your Dexterity modifier. Subtract the result from the first attack roll made against you before the beginning of your next turn.

Disarming Attack. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to disarm the target, forcing it to drop one item of your choice that it's holding. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and the target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it drops the object you choose. The object lands at its feet.

Disorienting Attack. When you make a successful weapon attack, you can expend a superiority die to disorient them, leaving them open for your allies to attack. The next attack roll that's made against the target by one of your allies has advantage if the attack is made before the start of your next turn. Add the result of your superiority die to the ally's attack roll.

Dodge Roll. When a creature damages you, you can use your reaction to expend a superiority die to deftly roll out of the way as a reaction. The damage you take is reduced by the number rolled on your superiority die, and you can move 10 feet in any direction without provoking opportunity attacks.

Intercept. When an enemy makes a ranged spell attack or a ranged attack within your ranged weapon's range, you can use your reaction and expend a superiority die to attempt to shoot it out of the air. Make a ranged weapon attack against the missile or spell, adding the number rolled on your superiority die to the attack roll. If the result is higher than the opposing ranged attack roll, the attack automatically fails as your bullet strikes it, either interrupting its effects or knocking it off course. You can use this trick before or after the attack roll is made, but before it's revealed to be a hit or a miss.

Piercing Attack. When you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack, you can expend a superiority die to have the shot continue on through the target after hitting it in order to attempt to damage an additional creature. If the creature is within your firearm's range and in the same line as your shot, and if it would have been hit by your attack roll, they take damage equal to the number rolled on your superiority die. The damage type is the same as the type dealt by the original attack.

Precision Attack. When you make a weapon attack roll against a creature, you can expend one superiority die and add the number rolled to the roll. You can use this trick before or after making the attack roll, but before any effects of the attack are applied.

Rocket Jump. If you make a jump, you can spend a superiority die to make the jump with vim and vigor, adding the number rolled + your Dexterity modifier to that jump's distance and make it not cost additional movement to make the jump.

Slinger's Luck. If your firearm would misfire, you can expend a superiority die in order to channel the inherent luck of your craft to avoid the misfire entirely. Add the number rolled on your superiority die to your next attack roll.

Sprint. When you move, you can expend a superiority die to go sprinting at full speed across the battlefield. Your walking speed increases by 10 feet until you stop moving. You can spend additional superiority die, up to 2 , to increase this distance by an additional 10 feet per point spent. If someone makes an opportunity attack against you, you can roll a superiority die you expended and add that number to your AC for that attack. You can do this as many times as you expended superiority die.

Trip Attack. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to knock the target down. You add a superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you knock the target prone.

Warning Attack. When you miss a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to frighten the target as the attack whizzes past them. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. Subtract the result of your superiority die from their roll. On a failed save, it is frightened of you until the end of your next turn.

## Spellshooter

Spellshooters have melded the pursuits of magic and engineering in search of a potential greater than the sum of its parts. Through a delicate magical ritual, they are able to condense and store spell energy in material vessels, creating dangerous weapons that do more than simply act as a conduit for the magic - they enhance it.

## Spellcasting

When you reach 3rd level and choose the Spellshooter trail, you gain the ability to cast magic from the wizard spell list. You leverage your keen mind to memorize your spells and channel the energy of your spells with pure mental acuity.
Spellcasting Conduit. Spellshooters can cast spells normally or infuse them within their bullets for increased range or more powerful effects. See the Arcane Ammunition feature for more information.
Cantrips. You learn two cantrips from the wizard spell list.
Spell Slots. The Spellshooter Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to use your spells of 1st level and higher. See the Flexible Preparation feature for information on how to use these slots. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher. You know two 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, which you must choose from the evocation or transmutation spells on the wizard spell list.
The Spells Known column of the Spellshooter Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be a transmutation or evocation spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 10th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1 st or 2 nd level.
The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.
Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the Wizard spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be a transmutation or evocation spell, unless you're replacing the spell you gained at 8th, 14th, or 20th level.
Spellcasting Ability. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your spells, as you study the ways of science and magic through learning and experimentation, and your sheer intellect powers your arcane potential. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
Spell Save DC $=8+$ your proficiency bonus + your
Intelligence modifier
Spell Attack Modifier = your proficiency bonus + your
Intelligence modifier

## Argane Ammunition

Spellshooters can use their unique talents to infuse the magical energy of spells into their gun and ammunition, releasing that energy upon firing the bullets from their gun. Their firearms are therefore modified to withstand the energy of the powerful spells within their confines.
At 3rd level you can, over the period of two hours out of a long rest, infuse a number of spells into pieces of nonmagical ammunition you own as you have available spell slots. A spell cast into a bullet this way has no effect, other than to be stored in the bullet. Each bullet can contain only one spell, and it contains these spells until you next complete a long rest, upon which the magic dissipates harmlessly.
During your turn, you can cast a spell stored in one of your bullets by firing it out of your gun. Each spell bullet has the following properties:

- The spell is cast at the same level as when it was initially cast.
- The range of the spell in the bullet becomes the same as the range of your firearm.
- The verbal, somatic, and material components for the spell were already fulfilled when casting the spell into the bullet, thus you do not need to provide them again.
- You must make a ranged spell attack roll against one creature within your gun's range in order to cast the spell within it successfully. If the bullet misses the target, the spell fails.
- The bullet itself deals no damage, instead breaking apart on contact to release the energy of the spell within it.
- If the spell requires one or more spell attack rolls, the first of those attack rolls is an automatic success. Any subsequent attack rolls, be they against other targets or the same target, are handled normally.
- If the spell has an area of effect, that area originates from the target. The target is included in the spell's area.
- If you are wielding two light firearms at once, only one gun can fire a spell bullet at a time.


## Flexible Preparation

Starting at 3rd level, you can alter the properties of spells you infuse into your bullets.
When you prepare a spell bullet with a spell that deals acid, cold, fire, force, lightning, necrotic, radiant, or thunder damage, you can substitute that damage type with another damage type from this list by altering the spell's properties before you infuse it into the bullet.

## Altering Spell Examples

While the Flexible Preparation feature offers increased versatility, at the table its effects can be difficult to spot by the other players. If you're playing a spellshooter, take a moment to describe how you alter your spells. For example, if you altered the burning hands spell to deal force damage instead of fire, perhaps it creates a wide, thin, pulsating beam. As another example, a blight spell set for cold damage may cause sharp shards of ice to crystallize in the target.

---

# Argane Smith 

When you reach 9th level, you have become adept at creating your magic munitions far more quickly than normal. As long as you have spell slots and mundane ammunition left, you can prepare a number of spell bullets equal to half your Intelligence modifier (rounded up) over the period of a short rest.

Additionally, you have improved your gun to be able to handle spell bullet magic far more easily. When you take the attack action during your turn, you can replace one of the attacks with a spell bullet attack.

## Argane Blueprints

At 13th level, spellshooters have become well learned in their magical studies, and can use this knowledge to create arcane blueprints containing new spells to cast or infuse into their ammunition.

You get proficiency in Intelligence (Arcana) checks if you don't have it already. If you do, double your proficiency bonus for checks you make with that skill.

You can create arcane blueprints for a number of spells equal to your Intelligence modifier. You may choose these spells from the wizard or cleric spell lists, and you create these blueprints using parchment and fine ink, following the rules for adding spells to a wizard's spellbook. You can keep arcane blueprints you create in a binder or stack that holds them all together.

When preparing arcane ammunition, you can infuse one or more of your bullets with spells that you have blueprints for. You do so by expending a spell slot of that spell's level and providing the spell's components.

## Eye For An Eye

When you reach 17th level, your intuition for the magical allows you to glean the knowledge of how to cast a spell as it is being cast - as long as you throw yourself right into the line of fire to collect it.

Once per long rest, when you are the target of a spell of 1st level or higher, you can use your reaction to hone your gunslinger wits to resist the spell's effects, all while studying the spell for the purposes of copying it. If the spell is a spell attack roll, it is made with disadvantage. If the spell requires you to make a saving throw to resist its effects, you make the save with advantage.

After the spell is cast, roll an Intelligence (Arcana) check. The DC is $10+$ twice the spell's level. On a successful check, you immediately create a spell bullet with the spell infused in it, or an arcane blueprint with the spell scribed on it. This effect occurs even if the spell reduces your hit points to 0 , as long as you are not killed outright. The bullet or blueprint contains the spell for 8 hours, after which point the magic in a bullet fades or a blueprint becomes unreadable.

When you cast a spell captured this way, it is a wizard spell for you. It is cast at the same level as the original spell, but uses your spell attack bonus and save DC.

Bullet Time. Starting at 3rd level, when you are hit with a ranged weapon attack from a firearm, you can use your reaction to expertly weave out of the bullet's path. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by $1 \mathrm{~d} 10+$ your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.

## BREACHER

When you make an attack with a firearm at a creature within 15 feet of you and you roll a 1 or 2 on the damage die, you can reroll the damage die and must take the new roll, even if the number is a 1 or a 2 . The firearm must have the scatter property for you to gain this benefit.

## SNIPER

If you make an attack with a two-handed firearm beyond 30 feet, you get a +2 bonus to your damage rolls with these weapons. The firearm cannot have the scatter property and gain this benefit.

## Shield Shooting

You can now wield a two-handed firearm with a shield, but must brace it against the shield as a bonus action to fire it.

---

## WARLOGK Pact BOON: Pact of the Firearm

Some warlocks summon blades into their waiting hands to cut down their foes. Others rely on their patron to fuel arcane incantations; still others manifest their connection to their patron in the form of a familiar. You, however, have taken a slightly different approach.

You can use your action to create a pact firearm in your empty hand. You can only summon a primitive firearm as your pact weapon until you reach 13th level, when you can now summon advanced firearms. Besides this limitation, you can choose the form that this firearm takes each time you create it. You are proficient with it while you wield it. This firearm counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. This firearm uses a magical reserve of ammunition supplied by your patron that does not run out, though you still need to reload it as normal.

Your pact firearm disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.

You can transform one magic firearm into your pact weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold the firearm. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can't affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the 1 -hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks.

## Pact Firearm

Your connection to your patron shapes the appearance of your weapon of choice. If your patron is the Archfey, your weapon might be a rifle made of polished redwood, decorated with gold plating shaped in complex leaf designs. A warlock drawing his power from a fiend might have a dark steel shotgun that is constantly smoldering, embers drifting off its stock. If you draw your magic from The Great Old One, your gun might resemble a pepperbox, hewn of ancient stone, engraved everywhere with glowing, yellow-orange eyes.

## Variant Rule: Firearms are Prominent

If firearms are common and prominent, at the DM's discretion, you can ignore the limitation to primitive firearms prior to 13 th level.

## Eldritch Invocations

## Blast \& Shoot

Prerequisite: Pact of the Firearm, eldritch blast cantrip, 5th level
When you cast eldritch blast, you can attack with your pact weapon as a bonus action.

## Customized Pact Weapon

Prerequisite: Pact of the Firearm, 13th level
Any firearm you create using your Pact Boon feature can start with one compatible attachment or custom part of your choice. This invocation doesn't affect a magic weapon you transformed into your pact weapon.

When you reach 17 th level, your pact weapon can start with your choice of two compatible attachments or custom parts.

## Draining Shot

Prerequisite: Pact of the Firearm, 11th level
When you make a successful attack against a creature with your pact firearm, you can choose to drain that creature of life and transfer it to you. A dark crimson line leads back to the barrel of your gun, giving you temporary hit points equal to half the amount of damage dealt.

## Eldritch Strike

Prerequisite: Eldritch blast cantrip, 9th level
When you cast eldritch blast, you can use a bonus action to make a weapon attack.
![img-7.jpeg](assets/The%20Homebrewery%20Steampunk_img-7.jpeg)

---

## Eldritch Storm

Prerequisite: Pact of the Firearm, eldritch blast cantrip, 18th level
As an action, you can concentrate the rays of your eldritch blast through the barrel of your pact weapon, focusing the crackling beams into one large ray of magical force. Make a ranged spell attack roll. If the attack hits, it deals force damage equal to $4 \mathrm{~d} 10+$ your Dexterity modifier.

This attack counts as casting eldritch blast for the sake of other invocations.

## First Impressions

In combat, your sheer force of will has an effect on your enemies and allies, giving you a unique edge. Add your Charisma modifier to your initiative rolls.

## Grasp of The Ancient One

Prerequisite: Great Old One patron, Pact of the Firearm You can create a blunderbuss (or shotgun if firearms are prominent, or when you reach 13th level) made from a black, inky marble and a sickly, green colored steel that seems to glow. Spectral tentacles writhe around the barrel of the shotgun, as slurping sounds following every shot you make with it. When you hit a creature an attack from this weapon, you can expend a spell slot to deal an additional 2 d 8 psychic damage to the target per slot level. If you do, the creature also becomes frightened of you until the end of your next turn.

## Greater Pact Firearm

Prerequisite: Pact of the Firearm, 13th level
You can summon a special firearm when you invoke your pact weapon. You can change your current weapon to become one of these special firearms when you take this invocation.

## Gunstorm

Prerequisite: Pact of the Firearm, 5th level
You can attack twice when you take the attack action on your turn using your pact weapon. You ignore the reload action for your pact weapon once when making these attacks.

## Improved Pact Weapon

Prerequisite: Pact of the Blade/Pact of the Firearm, 5th level You can use any weapon you summon with your Pact Boon feature as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells.

In addition, the weapon gains a +1 bonus to its attack and damage rolls, unless it is a magic weapon that already has a bonus to those rolls.

## Show of Force

Prerequisite: Pact of the Firearm/Pact of the Blade, 9th level You can use your Charisma modifier, instead of your Dexterity modifier, for your attack and damage rolls for your pact weapon.

## Sly SnIPER

Prerequisite: Archfey patron, Pact of the Firearm You can create an arquebus (or a bulky rifle if firearms are prominent, or when you reach 13th level) forged from a spindly wood, whose barrel is a bright brass adorned with ornate carvings. Vines are wrapped around the gun's length. When you hit a creature with an attack from this weapon, you can expend a spell slot to deal an additional 2 d 8 poison damage to the target per slot level. If you do, the creature is also charmed by you until the end of your next turn.

## Superior Pact Weapon

Prerequisite: Pact of the Blade/Pact of the Firearm, 9th level This functions as Improved Pact Weapon except your weapon gets a +2 bonus.

## Ultimate Pact Weapon

Prerequisite: Pact of the Blade/Pact of the Firearm, 15th level
This functions as Improved Pact Weapon except your weapon gets a +3 bonus.

## Wrath of The Inferno

Prerequisite: Fiend patron, Pact of the Firearm
You can create a musket (or a rifle if firearms are prominent, or when you reach 13th level) forged in the fires of Pandemonium. Its wood is a black, unbreakable charcoal, and its barrel is blood red. Flames seem to surround the trigger, but your hand remains unscathed even as you fire. When you hit a creature with an attack from this weapon, you can expend a spell slot to deal an additional 2 d 8 fire damage to the target per slot level. This damage ignores resistance and immunity.

## Argane Tradition: Sghool of Invention

This is a modification of the wizard Arcane Tradition originally published in Unearthed Arcana: Three Subclasses. It includes changes to the class features that makes use of material from this compendium.

The School of Invention claims credit for inventing the other schools of magic - a claim other wizards find absurd. Wizards of this school push magic to its limits. They stretch the known laws of arcane power and strive to reveal important truths about the nature of the multiverse.

Adherents of this school believe that innovation is best served through experimentation. They have a reputation for acting first, thinking second. Most wizards are scholars who have mastered their craft through careful study, rigorous practice, and endless hours of repetition. These wizards would rather throw spells together and see what happens.

Many wizards of this tradition are gnomes, alchemists, or both, and they take pride in the magic-infused armor they don. The armor not only provides protection, but it is also designed to help the wizard channel magic in unpredictable ways.

Wizards of this tradition are regarded as savants to their faces, but wizards of other traditions often think of them as lunatics.

## Tools of the InVENTOR

At 2nd level, you gain proficiency with two tools of your choice.

## ARCANOMEGhanigal Armor

Innovation is a dangerous practice, at least as far as members of this school practice it. As a shield against this risk, you have developed a suit of arcane armor.

Starting at 2nd level, you gain proficiency with light armor and gain a suit of arcanomechanical armor - a magic item that only you can attune to. While you are attuned to it and wearing it, it grants you resistance to force damage.

The armor is light armor and provides an AC of $12+$ your Dexterity modifier. It also has ballistics resistance (BR 1). It weighs 8 pounds.

You can create a new suit of it at the end of a long rest by touching a nonmagical suit of studded leather armor, which magically transforms it. Doing so removes the magic from your previous arcanomechanical armor, turning it into nonmagical studded leather.

## Reckless Casting

Starting at 2nd level, you can attempt to cast a spell you don't have prepared. When you use this ability, you use your action and choose one of the following options:

- Roll on the Reckless Casting table for cantrips and cast the resulting spell as part of this action.
- Expend a spell slot and roll twice on the Reckless Casting table for its level, or the 5th level table if the slot is 6th level or higher. Pick which of the two results you want to use and cast the resulting spell as part of this action.

## AlCHEMICAL CASTING

At 6th level, you learn to channel magic through your arcanomechanical armor to augment spells in a variety of ways. When you cast a spell while wearing that armor and attuned to it, you can expend one additional spell slot of 1st or 2nd level to alter the spell. The effect depends on the spell slot you expend.

A 1st-level slot allows you to manipulate the spell's energy. When you cast a spell that deals acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage, you can substitute that damage type for another one from that list.

A 2nd-level slot increases the spell's raw force. If you roll damage for the spell when you cast it, increase that damage by 2 d 10 force damage against one of the spell's targets (your choice) this turn.

## ARCANOMECHANICAL SHIEDding

At 10th level, you improve your arcanomechanical armor to stand up to effects both mundane and magical in nature. As a reaction while wearing your armor, you can expend a 1st-level spell slot to gain resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage for 1 minute.

Additionally, while you are wearing and attuned to your arcanomechanical armor, you can expend a 1st or 2nd level spell slot to cast absorb elements. When cast this way, you add the extra damage to the damage roll of your next melee attack, ranged attack, or damaging spell not requiring an attack roll.

## Controlled Chaos

At 14th level, your ability to improvise magic grows stronger. Whenever you roll on a Reckless Casting table for a spell other than a cantrip, you can roll on the table that is one level higher than the expended spell slot.

## BACKGROUNDS

When included, backgrounds help you create a more believable character. Work with your DM to determine an appropriate background for your character.

## Background: Doctor

Whether you were a tribal witch-doctor, a medicine-man, a holy healer, a military field medic, or a genuine medical professional from an unusually enlightened society, you specialize in the treatment of suffering. You have seen injury, disease, poison, and death, and still you have defied it all, fighting to save every last soul.

As a medical professional, you have sworn the Hippocratic oath and do your best to adhere to its tenets. In so swearing, you have pledged your life to protect life, that all who suffer are your patient, to support other doctors as family, to train any who swear the oath, to practice to the best of your ability, to always improve upon the art, to practice only your specialization, to practice not for your own gain, to practice within the law, and to keep all of your patients' secrets.

Why did you turn away from the medical profession? Or if you haven't, what was it that drew you into the life of the adventurer? What do you think of the oath, or other doctors?

## SPECIALIST

Each doctor must choose a field of specialization to practice within the broader art of medicine.

| d6 | Specialization |
| :-- | :-- |
| 1 | Diagnostics |
| 2 | Apothecary |
| 3 | Surgery |
| 4 | Bone Setting |
| 5 | Therapy |
| 6 | Research |

Skill Proficiencies: Medicine, Investigation
Tool Proficiencies: Medicine Kit
Languages: One of your choice
Equipment: Doctor's Tools, 2-man tent, bedroll, blanket, Book (About anatomy, disease, apothecary, or surgery), common clothes, five bars of soap, a belt pouch containing 5 gp .

## Feature: Burden of Life

Due to your vow, you are expected to cure the ill, regardless of morals or prejudice, even if they are your enemy. Likewise, it is considered a horrid evil to intentionally kill a doctor for no reason. As such, intelligent enemies are less likely to target you, provided they are not overwhelmingly evil or lack a code of honor. Your patients who are enemies will even stay their hand, not attacking you directly while they are under your care. Though... who's to say what happens after they leave your care?

Restored individuals may be grateful, or feel some form of life-debt to you. Enemies may repay you by specifically choosing not to kill you, or they may give free information; a scout you once saved may turn a blind eye to your presence.

Provided you stay true to your vow as best as you can, you can make use of any hospital or medical facility - typically located in churches, noble estates, universities, and other places of higher learning - as temporary residence for yourself, your patient or patients, and your companions if there is room for them. Doctors will put you up at a lifestyle one step below their own if you can maintain a good relationship with them.

However, if ever you are proven to have broken your vow, you will be fully and publicly discredited as a doctor, and other doctors who pay attention to medical society will recognize you as such. You and all who are with you will be turned away from mundane medicine and the places it is provided. Because you swore on your life, breaking your vow is akin to a personal death sentence, though no doctor true to his vows is free to exact it upon you. Even so, more enlightened nations are likely to have laws regarding the treatment of doctors and their vows... and enlightened does not necessarily mean "kind" or "gentle".

## Suggested Characteristics

Doctors may come from many walks of life, but all became enrolled in some place of higher learning, or at least were tutored by a renowned doctor, eventually swearing the Hippocratic oath - and that oath is not a light load to bear. Doctors often show their true colors under extreme stress, whether it makes them more studious, intense, and passionate, or clinical intellectual, and unusually calm.

Many are troubled by harrowing events they bore witness to. Some are shockingly pragmatic, with an "it may not be pretty, but you'll live" approach to problems. Many are seemingly tireless, hard-working individuals. Some can be inspiring souls, with a deep appreciation not only for life itself, but for the people they keep alive as well. There is much debate among doctors as to just what the oath means, and what tenets have priority in any given situation.

## d8 Personality Trait

1 All I think about is saving lives, or I dwell on lives that have been lost that I could have saved.
2 I practice in the name of my religion, nation, or clan.
3 I am cold and calculating in my every word and action, even when furious or frightened.
4 When the bodies hit the floor, my hands go into autopilot.
5 I consider magical healers and healing either to be cheating and unaccountable, or an integral future counterpart of a greater medical art.
6 I am waging a personal war on death itself.
7 I am entranced and inspired by the brilliance and glory of the living body.
8 I am actively involved in the medical society and engage in theoretical discourse and debate.

---

## d6 Ideal

1 Life. I was put in this world to protect and save life. (Good)
2 Oath. I swore my oath, and now I must live by its tenets. (Lawful)
3 Vigilantism. No man can dictate who shall die, when, or how! (Chaotic)
4 Profit. Is it really too much to ask that all who come to me suffering also come bearing compensation? (Evil)
5 Survival. We are all in this together, for better or for worse. (Neutral)
6 Right. Everyone deserves to live. (Neutral)

## d6 Bond

1 I owe everything to my home village/clan, for pooling their resources to have me educated.
2 I was pushed, or encouraged, into the field by my parents, one of whom may have been a doctor.
3 My professor is the most important person in the world to me.
4 My patients are my everything- losing one of them is like dying, but it never ends.
5 I took up the profession because someone close to me died of something treatable.
6 I started my training alone from texts I obtained by my own means.

## d6 Flaw

1 I took the vow not realizing its full implications.
2 No one can know that I have broken my vow.
3 I feel contempt for many of my patients.
4 I think I am better than other doctors, and other people in general.
5 Sometimes I go too far in my search for knowledge.
6 I am frightened/sickened by human suffering.

## Variant Doctor: Veterinarian

Your specialization and training still stand, but instead of treating people, your art is focused on our fuzzy friends. Exchange Investigation for Animal Handling or Nature.

Animals who have been healed do not behave the same way people do. Some more intelligent creatures, such as wolves, may be capable of feeling gratitude, but have limited ability to express such. Monsters however, true to their name, are usually incapable of such emotion and will likely just attack the moment they recover. Other doctors may not take you as seriously as you deserve, but anyone who has an important animal, such as a knight's steed or a caster's familiar, will have deep respect for you, for even acknowledging that their animal is worth saving.

---

## BACKGROUND: LaW ENFORGEMENT:

As a child, you dreamed of serving your city with pride and protecting it from evil and injustice. When you were old enough, you headed to your recruiting station to begin the training to become a member of law enforcement.

Languages: One additional language of your choice
Equiptment: Light pistol, two full magazines, and a police uniform

## Feature: Civil Ranking

Being a officer of the law, you gain privileges suitable to your station. If you are within the city that you served in, patrol officers are likely to follow your orders, within logical reason.

Outside of your jurisdiction, you have advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks and Charisma saving throws (again, within reason) against law enforcement of equal or lesser rank. You must show your badge, thus identifying yourself as a member of law enforcement, to use this feature.

When choosing this background, roll a d6, or choose a rank from 1-6 from the options below. Players cannot begin at a rank of 7 or higher. Rankings are as follows:

- Rank 10: Chief of Police, Superintendent, Director, or Commissioner
- Rank 9: Deputy/Assistant Chief, Superintendent, Director or Commissioner
- Rank 8: Major
- Rank 7: Captain or Commander
- Rank 6: Lieutenant
- Rank 5: Staff Sergeant, Sergeant First Class, First Sergeant, Master Sergeant, or Sergeant Major

7 If I'm paid, I'm happy. It doesn't matter who paid me.
8 I will give everything I have to save my people, including my life.

## d6 Ideal

1 Truth. The duty of law enforcement is to seek and lay bare the truth. (Any)
2 Justice. I won't sleep until I catch every dirty criminal I see. (Lawful)
3 Law. What good is the law if it isn't followed? (Good)

## BACKGROUND: MERCENARY

As a mercenary your services were for hire to anyone who could afford you. What drove you to be a soldier of fortune? Was it to escape poverty? Was it the thrill of battle? Or was it simply that fighting was all you knew growing up?

Who was your battle company, or did you work alone? What made you give it up... or are you still for hire? Did you make any allies or enemies along the way? What wars or battles were you involved in? What were the consequences? Lost allies? War crime charges?

Skill Proficiencies: Intimidation, Perception Tool Proficiencies: One type of gaming set, Vehicles (land) Equipment: Proof of the first contract you completed, a set of common clothes, one gaming set of choice, a belt pouch containing 10 gp

## Feature: Hired Blade

You are a soldier of fortune, a fighter who sells his services to the highest bidder. You roam towns and cities in search of a place where your unique set of talents are useful; whether for a lord hunting a group of bandits, or a local barkeep tired of the goblin infestation in his cellar, you can always find some work if you look hard enough. The job itself doesn't matter, so long as you get paid - at least, that's what people tend to think. Sometimes, the jobs you find tend to be of the seedier sort, giving you the choice and the problem of figuring a way to compromise between your ethics and your job.

## Suggested Characteristics

You are a mercenary who hunted down your employers' enemies for coin. Were you happy in this life? What made you leave it behind to become an adventurer? Did you leave it at all, or is adventuring just another way of putting food on the table?

## d8 Personality Trait

1 I like to show off, particularly if there's a chance at another job.
2 I am always gregarious and cheerful, no matter the situation, as long as my pockets are full.
3 To me, the whisper of steel and the clash of weapons is just as pleasing as any amount of gold.
4 I always train because training leaves the body ready, even in a moment of respite or weakness.
5 I hold myself to a strict code of ideals.
6 I keep my personal possessions in secret places which known only to me.
7 I take special care to protect my weapons and armor, for I know they will protect me in return.
8 I refuse to lift a finger until I hear the jingling sound of coins.

## d6 Ideal

1 Golden Pockets. I fight for money, and nothing else. (Neutral)
2 Great Publicity. I will be known for my deeds, sooner rather than later. (Any)
3 Power or Death. In my line of profession, the strong live and the weak starve. (Evil)
4 Honorbound. I never break my promises. Ever. (Lawful)
5 War and Crime. Whenever chaos flourishes, so too does my work. (Chaotic)
6 Vigilante. I am a sellsword who swings his weapon only against those who deserve it. (Good)

## d6 Bond

1 I became a mercenary to support my family, who would have probably starved in a slum somewhere if not for me.
2 I fight for a lover that knows little if not nothing of me.
3 I was inspired by a great hero to become a mercenary.
4 I treat my valued comrades like brothers, and I will let no insult or injury fall upon them.
5 I am protecting something of great importance to me by keeping it a secret... so you'd better forget what you just heard.
6 I never disrespect an employer, as long as they never disrespect me or stop giving me money.

## d6 Flaw

1 I'll do anything for coin, damn the consequences.
2 As much as I pretend to love fighting, I secretly hate hurting others.
3 I have crippling debts that my work barely pays off.
4 I never fail at my tasks, even if I have to resort to less honourable means to complete them.
5 I would send an innocent to face his death if it means I will win the fight.
6 Someone powerful will do anything to have my head, so I seek to take his or her head first.

## Background: Merchant

Whether you spent a few years as an apprentice or you were self-taught, you know your way around a marketplace. It's like a second home to you, where you can talk for hours on end and you know exactly what you can and can't do.

Languages: Two of your choice
Equipment: An item you were unable to sell, a few minor souvenirs from places you've been to, a backpack, a set of traveler's clothes, and a belt pouch containing 50 gp .

## Feature: Soft Skills

Your know exactly what to say and do to close a sale. Once per day, you can use this feature to gain advantage on a single Charisma check that involves negotiating a deal with others.

Variant Feature: Hard Negotiation. This is not roleplaying. When attempting to sell a magical item (as detailed in Xanathar's Guide to Everything's downtime rules), you get a +5 bonus to the Charisma (Persuasion) check required for the Magic Item Offer.

## Suggested Characteristics

Travelling around and interacting with people shaped how you act around people, consider the following traits.

## d8 Personality Trait

1 I am very protective of my merchandise.
2 I'm very talkative, and I like to interact with people.
3 I like to take notes about my customer's appearance, disposition, and items they have on hand.
4 I talk very quickly, and always cut to the chase.
5 I like to joke around and tell stories.
6 I speak in an unusual dialect.
7 I give my two cents on everything.
8 I like to dabble in many different cultures. It's all so interesting!

## d6 Ideal

1 Charity. I'm doing what I do so others can benefit from my goods. (Good)
2 Greed. I'm doing this for money. Nothing else matters. (Evil)
3 People. I love to interact with people. That's the most important thing. (Neutral)
4 Change. Change makes the world go round. It's everywhere and needs to be embraced. (Chaotic)
5 Fairness. Everyone deserves equal opportunity. (Lawful)
6 Aspiration. I hope my life and my wares propel me to greatness. (Any)

## d6 Bond

1 My business is my life. I must always make a sale.
2 I am being pursued by a crime boss I can never repay.
3 All I am trying to do is provide for my family.
4 I will do anything for the right amount of gold.
5 Seeing the world is as valuable as gold, I must see it all.
6 My culture and my past keep me on the road, always looking for the next sale.

## d6 Flaw

1 The only thing I trust is gold.
2 No amount of gold is worth my life, I will run when in danger.
3 Making a profit is more important than honesty or integrity.
4 People's feelings mean little to me, they are worth only as much as the gold in their pockets.
5 The mere mention of gold throws all my judgement out the window.
6 If there's a bet, then I'm in. All in. Double or nothing. Don't tell me the odds, just roll the dice!

## BACKGROUND: Philosopher

## By u/Ezfi

You have dedicated yourself to the pursuit of answers to life's most difficult questions, ones of existence, morality and meaning, and you have made a name for yourself doing so. Perhaps you were privileged and classically trained, inheriting your theories from the world's greatest minds and making them your own. Or maybe you started the quest for truth from nothing, forming your philosophy by debating with any friend or stranger who would entertain you, and your conclusions have only recently received wide attention and acclaim. After spending a lifetime in the realm of thought, it may be surprising to see you pursue the active and practical life of an adventurer.

## Skill Proficiencies: History, Insight

Languages: Two of your choice
Equipment: A book of your thoughts, a quill, a jar of black ink, an small trinket that once gave you a philosophical revelation, a set of common clothes, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp .

## Feature: Debate Ethics

Among those who study philosophy, including cultured nobles, academics and other philosophers, there is a chance that at least some of them have heard of your work. Those who respect philosophy will assume you to be a reasonably wise and intelligent person, and they will be more likely to listen to your advice. Using your reputation and experience in debate, you may be able to convince these people that an act which seems evil, wrong, or morally questionable at first glance is, in fact, perfectly fine. While they are not guaranteed to agree with you, they are more likely to give your arguments serious consideration.
![img-11.jpeg](assets/The%20Homebrewery%20Steampunk_img-11.jpeg)

## Philosophies

## d20 Philosophy

1 Solipsism. Knowledge of anything outside one's own specific mind is unjustified. The external world and other minds cannot be known and might not exist.
2 Determinism. Every event, including thoughts and behavior, decision and action, is determined by an unbroken chain of prior occurrences.
3 Utilitarianism. The moral worth of an action is solely determined by its contribution to overall utility, that is, what creates the most net happiness.
4 Hedonism. Pleasure is the only intrinsic good. Actions can be evaluated in terms of how much pleasure they produce.
5 Positivism. Knowledge can only come from positive affirmation through a strict scientific method.
6 Absurdism. Any effort to find meaning in the universe will ultimately fail (and, hence, is absurd) because no such meaning exists.
7 Objectivism. Certain acts are objectively right or wrong.
8 Relativism. No belief can have absolute truth, having value only within a certain context or frame of reference.
9 Nihilism. Life is without objective meaning, purpose, value or truth.
10 Existentialism. All philosophical thought must begin with the experiences of the individual, and it is up to them to give meaning to their own existence.
11 Rationalism. The criterion of the truth is not sensory, but intellectual and deductive.
12 Stoicism. Emotional and physical self-control leads to inner peace and strength, allowing one to live a happier life.
13 Aestheticism. Our main efforts in life should be on creating and enjoying beauty, in all of its forms.
14 Collectivism. The greater good is more important than any individual.
15 Egalitarianism. All individuals should be treated as equals.
16 Constructivism. Reality, and the methods we use to understand it, are subjective constructions rather than an objective reading of events.
17 Naturalism. The supernatural and the natural are indistinguishable and can be studied with the same methods.
18 Finalism. Any event is defined by a pre-set final outcome, and all events leading up to the outcome are shaped by it.
19 Cynicism. Selfless qualities like altruism, honest and virtue do not exist. People are only driven by selfinterest.
20 I haven't settled on a philosophy.

## Personal Philosophy

After spending a lifetime asking and pondering, you have developed a personal philosophical stance. Choose one from the Philosophies table or roll on it to determine what your character is mainly focused on.

## Suggested Characteristics

Philosophers are highly concerned with thoughts, theories, and abstract concepts, and tend to view the world in a way that is tinted by this fixation. They may embrace the world around them as a fascinating manifestation of the universe's inner workings, or they may shun it in favor of their internal experience.

## d8 Personality Trait

1 I never stop asking questions. Ever.
2 I am absent minded and easily distracted.
3 I spend several hours each day in quiet introspection.
4 I love seeing how other respond to paradoxes and strange thought experiments.
5 The philosophical conclusions of common people are just as valuable as those from established academics.
6 I enjoy the challenge of explaining complex philosophical concepts in terms that a layman can understand.
7 I am unflappable in the face of tragedy, analyzing the situation in a calm, academic manner.
8 Everything can be seen as a metaphor for the deeper meaning of life.

## d6 Ideal

1 Truth. There are answers out there and I intend to find them. (Any)
2 Indoctrination. I won't be happy until everyone believes exactly what I believe. (Lawful)
3 Virtue. What good is a moral system if you don't put it into practice? (Good)
4 Justification. I use philosophy to excuse my cruel impulses. (Evil)
5 Rebellion. I like thinking and believing differently than everyone else. (Chaotic)
6 Aspiration. I want to be like the great philosophers that I look up to. (Any)

## d6 Bond

1 I have written a book, paper or manifesto on my philosophy and I want to promote it.
2 I need to find meaning in my life.
3 There is a living philosopher that I look up to more than anyone, and I dream of meeting them.
4 My philosophy is just one way that I show my deep devotion to the god I worship.
5 I owe my theories and success to the school of philosophy that trained me.
6 I am always on the hunt for evidence that my philosophy is the correct one.

## d6 Flaw

1 I get so caught up in thought experiments that I don't pay attention to the real world.
2 My philosophy comes with implications that trouble me deeply, and I fear accepting them.
3 I get personally offended when my views are challenged.
4 I'm a hypocrite who can't follow my own beliefs.
5 Practical problems always stump me.
6 I'm not wrong, I just think on such a high abstract level that no one else gets it.

## Background: Slave

## u/Moses_The_Wise

You are some kind of slave or indentured servant, or you are or were controlled entirely by another person or group of people. You don't have to be a slave in the traditional sense; an abused and isolated child, a tortured prisoner, or an underpaid servant or worker, any or all of these people could take this background.
Were you a field worker, sweating to bring in harvests? Or were you a house slave who took care of the master and his/her household? Maybe you worked in something similar to a sugar plantation, where the work was highly dangerous and often lethal.
You can choose whether you bought your freedom, were freed by someone else or even your master/mistress, escaped and are on the run, or if you still actually serve them but are travelling on your own for one reason or another.

## Skill Proficiencies: Deception, Intimidation

Languages: One of your choice, which you are illiterate in. Equipment: A pair of manacles you at one point wore, A simple memento from your family or a fellow slave, something you used to do your job as a slave, 5 gp .

## Specialty

As a slave, you had a job to do - whether you liked it or not. Roll a d 8 on the table to determine that job.

## d8 Job

1 Maid/Butler
2 Field Worker
3 Concubine
4 Fisher
5 Miner
6 Assistant
7 Gardener
8 Cook

---

## Feature: Grovel

You are used to bowing, scraping and apologizing for even slight offenses. While more prideful slaves are loathe to do it, you can earn enough through begging to live a Poor lifestyle in most cities, and you can usually find someone who is willing to take you in - though there may be a price, and it may not be gold.

## Suggested Characteristics

Slaves will have been shaped by the way they were treated, and what kind of work they did. Their treatment and their relationships to both other slaves as well as their masters/mistresses affect their mannerisms and ideals. Their flaws might be a side effect of the trauma of their slavery.

## d8 Personality Trait

1 I am shy, rarely speak, and avoid eye contact.
2 My manners are spot on; I'm always polite and respectful.
3 I'm sick of biting my tongue, and am purposefully rude to those I dislike.
4 I am rather uncouth, with little understanding of social etiquette.
5 Sometimes I misinterpret requests as orders.
6 I don't take commands from anyone.
7 I am subservient and servile.
8 I prefer to be in charge.

## d6 Ideal

1 Subservient. Just follow the rules and do what you're told, and everything will be alright. (Lawful)
2 Release. No one should suffer slavery as I have. (Good)
3 Freedom. Everyone should be allowed to do as they please. (Chaotic)
4 Autonomy. I just want to live my life undisturbed. (Neutral)
5 Power. It would be nice to be the one holding the whip for once. (Evil)
6 Wander. I wish to see the world that I've never been able to see. (Any)

## d6 Bond

1 My master treated me well, and I consider them to be my family.
2 I ran away from my old master; they're still looking for me.
3 I am still in service to my master.
4 Slavery separated me from my family; perhaps I'll find them again.
5 Someone I love is still a slave; I want to free them.
6 I owe my life, and my freedom, to the one who freed me.

## d6 Flaw

1 I am terrified of authority figures.
2 I often will just do what others tell me to.
3 I refuse to listen to anyone else, or take any advice.
4 My scars, both mental and physical, still cause me great pain.
5 I have little pity for slaves that have accepted their fate.
6 I have an extreme fear of confinement and punishment.

## Averer's Awakening

7th-level Transmutation
Casting Time: 8 hours
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M * (A precious gem worth 5000 gp, that the spell consumes)
Duration: Instantaneously
After spending the casting time tracing magical pathways within a precious gemstone, you touch a Huge or smaller Construct or Plant. The target must have either no Intelligence score or an Intelligence of 4 or less. The target gains an Intelligence of 10 . The target also gains the ability to speak one language you know of your choosing. If the target is a plant, it gains the ability to move its limbs, roots, vines, creepers, and so forth, and it gains senses similar to a human's. Your GM chooses statistics appropriate for the awakened plant, such as the statistics for the awakened shrub, the awakened tree or grove guardian.

The awakened construct or plant retains the loyalties it held before awakening, but is now more capable at following orders and making its own desisions. If the construct or plant under the influence of a perceived enemy of yours it will become/remain hostile towards you and your allies.

## Black Bullet

Necromancy cantrip
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
You conjure and fire a tiny, black orb that clings to its target like a leech, draining some of its vital force. As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a ranged attack with a firearm within the spell's range, otherwise the spell fails. On a hit, the target takes 1 d 4 necrotic damage, and the bullet clings to the target's body until it spends an action to remove it. At the start of each of the target's turns, it takes 1d4 necrotic damage as long as the bullet remains attached to it.

This spell's damage on subsequent turns increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4).

## Blood-Lightning Bullet

Transmutation cantrip
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: S, M (a firearm)
Duration: Instantaneous
As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a ranged attack with a firearm against one creature within the spell's range, otherwise the spell fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, and blood-red lightning leaps from the target to a different creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of it. The second creature takes lightning damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.

This spell's damage increases when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, the ammunition deals an extra 1d8 lightning damage to the target, and the lightning damage to the second creature increases to $1 \mathrm{~d} 8+$ your spellcasting ability modifier. Both damage rolls increase by 1 d 8 at 11 th level and 17 th level.

## Bubble Shield

4th-level evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self (5-foot radius)
Components: M (an iron bowl, a leather strap from a shield)
Duration: 1 minute
You create a static, impenetrable shield in a 5 -foot radius around yourself for the duration of the spell. Any creatures can enter and exit the shield freely.

Attacks, spells, and damaging effects originating from outside of the shield cannot affect anything inside the shield, as they either bounce off of it or are harmlessly deflected away. By the same token, creatures outside of the shield cannot target anything inside the shield with an attack, spell, or ability.

The same is true for attacks, spells, abilities, and effects within the shield attempting to target or affect anything outside of it.

## Card Throw

Conjuration cantrip
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
You conjure and then throw a magical card with a random effect. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, a card strikes it, exploding on impact. Each card is a different color and has a unique effect. For each target, roll a d6 to determine which color and effects the card has.

- 1. Red: The target takes fire damage equal to $1 \mathrm{~d} 6+$ your spellcasting ability modifier.
- 2. Orange: The target takes acid damage equal to $1 \mathrm{~d} 6+$ your spellcasting ability modifier.
- 3. Yellow: The target takes lightning damage equal to $1 \mathrm{~d} 6+$ your spellcasting ability modifier.
- 4. Green: The target takes poison damage equal to $1 \mathrm{~d} 6+$ your spellcasting ability modifier.
- 5. Blue: The target takes cold damage equal to $1 \mathrm{~d} 6+$ your spellcasting ability modifier.
- 6. Violet: The target takes 1d6 psychic damage and must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become blinded until the end of their next turn.

The spell creates more than one card when you reach higher level: two cards at 5th level, three cards at 11 th level, and four at 17 th level. You can direct the cards at the same target or at different ones. Make a separate attack roll and d6 roll for each card.

---

## Chromatic Bullet

Evocation cantrip
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a small prism)
Duration: Instantaneous
As part of the action used to cast this spell, choose acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, or thunder. Then you must make a ranged attack with a firearm within the spell's range, otherwise the spell fails. This attack does not expend a piece of ammunition from your firearm.

If the attack hits, it deals 1d4 additional damage of the chosen type.

The spell's damage increases by 1 d 4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4).

## Chromatic Wave

6th-level evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self (30-foot radius)
Components: V
Duration: Instantaneous
You charge up and release a wave of magical energy charged with elemental power.

Choose two damage types from either acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison or thunder. Each creature you choose within 30 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d6 damage of the first chosen type, 5d6 damage of the second chosen type, and is stunned until the beginning of your next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't stunned.

## Conjure Firing Squad

5th-level conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 90 feet
Components: S, M (any piece of nonmagical ammunition)
Duration: Instantaneous
You fire a piece of nonmagical ammunition from a ranged weapon or throw a nonmagical weapon towards a point within range. The round conjures many firearms aimed at creatures of your choice within 30 feet of the point chosen that all fire at once and then disappear.

Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of the point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 10d6 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Conjure Flak Jagket

1st-level conjuration
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (a chip of ceramic)
Duration: 8 hours
You touch a willing creature who isn't wearing armor. Wisps of shadow material pulled from the Shadowfell form and knit themselves into a tough, yet light and flexible vest, fitted perfectly to the creature. The vest is considered light armor with ballistics resistance (BR 3), though proficiency with it is not required to use it. While wearing the armor, a creature's base AC becomes $12+$ its Dexterity modifier. The spell ends if the creature doffs the armor or if you dismiss the spell as an action.

## Cryobomb

8th-level evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S, M (a piece of dry ice and silver powder worth 25 sp )
Duration: Concentration, 1 minute
A glowing bead of ice forms from your finger and shoots out to a point within range, where it remains and grows colder for the duration. When the spell ends, either because your concentration is broken or because you decide to end it on your turn, the bead breaks apart and lets out an ice storm that flash freezes anything near it and spreads around corners. Each creature within a 20 -foot radius sphere centered on the point must succeed a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes cold damage equal to the accumulated damage and is paralyzed for a number of rounds equal to the accumulated number on a failed save. If a creature succeeds the save, it takes half as much damage and is not paralyzed. A creature can remake the Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its subsequent turns in order to end the paralysis.

This spell's base damage is 8d6 and its base paralysis time is 1 round. If at the end of your turn the bead has not yet detonated, the damage increases by 1 d 6 and the paralysis increases by 1 round.

If the glowing bead is touched before the interval has expired, the creature touching it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the spell ends immediately, causing the bead to explode in a freezing storm of ice. On a successful save, the creature can throw the bead up to 40 feet. When it strikes a creature or a solid object, the spell ends, and the bead explodes. The cold freezes objects in the area and puts out nonmagical flames.

---

## CRYOSTASIS

2nd-level evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: S, M (a drop of water and fine dust)
Duration: Instantaneous
You choose one creature within range. You close your fist and flash freeze the air around them in an attempt to lock their joints up and freeze them in place. The creature must succeed a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 2d6 cold damage and has its movement speed reduced to 0 for 1 minute. At the end of each of its subsequent turns, the creature can remake the saving throw in order to end the spell's effects on itself.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1 d 6 for each slot level above 2nd.

## DARING DITTY

Enchantment cantrip
Casting Time: 1 reaction, which you take when an ally makes a saving throw
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, M (a musical instrument or speaking cone)
Duration: Instantaneous
You play or sing a quick little ditty for a single ally you can see within range. This spell appears to be nothing more than a song unless a creature that can hear it makes a Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell save DC to recognize otherwise.

When your ally hears the song, they are uplifted by the magical music. You can roll a Charisma saving throw, using your bonus to the save, and use the result in place of an ally's saving throw to escape the effect of a spell. If an enemy recognized the song as magical with a successful Perception check, you have disadvantage on this roll.

Your ally must be able to hear you to receive the benefit of this spell.

## DROP SHIELD

4th-level abjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self (10-foot radius)
Components: M (an iron bowl, powder from medicinal herbs)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You create a soothing shield in a 10 -foot-radius sphere that heals the wounds of allies within its boundaries. All creatures can enter and exit the shield freely.

Allies other than you that start their turn within the shield or enter its area for the first time regain hit points equal to $1 \mathrm{~d} 4+$ your spellcasting ability modifier. Attacks and spells originating from within the shield can't target enemies outside of the shield, or vice-versa, but can target the shield itself.

The shield is an object that has an AC of 10 and hit points equal to five times your caster level. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends.

## Elemental Bullets

3rd-level evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S, M (pieces of nonmagical ammunition)
Duration: Instantaneous
You infuse a number of pieces of mundane ammunition equal to your spellcasting ability modifier with a single element of your choice. Choose from fire, cold, lightning, acid, poison, or thunder. When a target is hit by a ranged weapon attack using one of these bullets, it takes an extra 2d6 damage of the chosen type. The spell's magic ends on the piece of ammunition when it hits or misses.

## Find the Trajectory

1st-level divination (ritual)
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: Self
Components: V, S, M (a handful of white dust or powder)
Duration: Concentration, 10 minutes
For the duration, you can touch a bullet hole in a structure or a bullet wound on a person and discover where the round was fired from. If you spend an additional minute concentrating on the impact site, you can determine the type of firearm used to fire the bullet. If you concentrate on the same impact site for the spell's full duration, you can obtain a vague sense of the shooter's race, gender, and height.

## FORCEFUL BULLET

Transmutation cantrip
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: M (a firearm and a piece of its ammunition)
Duration: 1 round
The bullet you touch is loaded into a firearm, where it is fired with excessive force. The next time a ranged weapon attack is made with that firearm, if the attack hits, add a d6 to the damage roll. If the firearm has the reload property, this attack counts as two attacks towards its reload count.

The spell's magic fades if the firearm is not used to attack before your next turn.

The damage die improves to a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 11th level, and a d12 at 17 th level.

## FORTIFY

2nd-level abjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: S, M (a pot of red clay and a handful of earth)
Duration: Concentration, 1 minute
You draw runes onto the skin and clothing of a willing creature. The runes glow with protective magic that wards them from debilitating effects. The first time the target would be subjected to the paralyzed, petrified, prone, restrained, or stunned condition due to an attack, spell, or effect, if it is not at 0 hit points, it ignores that condition instead, and the spell ends.

---

# GHOST BulLETS 

4th-level transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S, M (pieces of nonmagical ammunition)
Duration: 1 hour
By speaking a ghostly incantation, you transform up to four nonmagical bullets in your inventory into ethereal projections that pass through inorganic material.

When making a ranged attack using one of these bullets, the target's AC is equal to $10+$ its Dexterity modifier, regardless of any cover it has or any armor it is wearing. If it isn't wearing armor and has a feature such as Unarmored Defense, it can use that AC calculation instead. Additionally, ranged attacks using these rounds deal double damage to spirits.

However, since they ignore inorganic material, constructs are not affected by these bullets, and attacks made against them with these bullets automatically miss.

The spell's magic ends on the bullets after 1 hour.

## Glassing Beam

9th-level evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 300 feet
Components: S, M (a focusing lens, glow worm powder, an emerald worth $5,000 \mathrm{gp}$ that is consumed when the spell is cast)
Duration: Concentration, 12 hours
You call upon a mighty, destructive beam of magical force to destroy your enemies and burn the earth around them until its surface is but glass.

Choose a point within range. You summon forth a large, white-orange pulsating beam in a 30 -foot-radius, 50,000 -foothigh column centered on that point. Creatures that start their turn within that area or enter it for the first time take 5 d 10 fire damage, 5 d 10 radiant damage, 5 d 10 force damage, and 5 d 10 necrotic damage. After two rounds, the beam turns the surface within it into cracked and jagged glass, destroying plants and objects that aren't being worn or carried. This turns the area into difficult terrain that is extraordinarily painful to cross. Any creature that moves more than half its speed on this terrain takes 2 d 10 piercing damage. Structures hit by this beam take double the damage from this spell.

You must use your action to maintain the beam. While you are doing so, your movement speed is 0 and you have disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws. You can use your bonus action to move the beam up to 20 feet in any direction.

---

## Hawkeye

2nd-level transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: M (the preserved eye of a hawk or owl)
Duration: 1 hour
You touch a willing creature. Its eyes become sharp and acute, granting it advantage on Wisdom (Perception) and Intelligence (Investigation) checks relying on sight for the duration.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the creature also gains advantage on ranged attack rolls for the duration.

## Heavenly Bullet

Evocation cantrip
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Calling upon the aspect of the divine within you, your firearm's shot seems to sing with heavenly light. As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a ranged attack with a firearm within the spell's range, otherwise the spell fails. On a hit, the attack deals damage as normal and the target must succeed a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d8 radiant damage. The target gains no benefit from cover for this saving throw.

The spell's damage increases by 1 d 8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

## Hydraulic Beam

3rd-level evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self (30-foot long, 15 -foot wide line)
Components: V, S, M (a drop of water)
Duration: Instantaneous
You project a large jet of water from your hand or an object you are holding or carrying. The beam shoots forth from you in a 30 -foot long, 15 -foot wide line in a direction of your choosing. Creatures within the line must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d6 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1 d 6 for each slot level above 3rd.

## IGE BAYONET

1st-level conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: S, M (a piece of ice and a two-handed firearm)
Duration: 1 minute
You create a shard of ice at the end of the barrel of a rifle, musket, blunderbuss, or shotgun you touch. For 1 minute, you can use this firearm as a finesse melee weapon that deals 1d6 piercing damage and 2 d 6 cold damage on a hit.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the cold damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.

## Ironwood Aegis

2nd-level conjuration
Casting Time: 1 bonus action
Range: Self
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 hour
Your body becomes suffused with nature's power, granting a fighting chance against improving technology. You gain ballistics resistance (BR 1) for the duration of the spell. This applies even if you are not wearing armor.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the ballistics resistance increases to BR 2. When you use a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the ballistics resistance increases to BR 3.

## Jinx

1st-level enchantment
Casting Time: 1 reaction, which you take when a creature hits you with an attack
Range: 90 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
You place a vengeful curse on a creature as it attacks you. This curse wracks their minds whenever they attempt to strike you. When this spell is cast, and for the duration of the spell, whenever the cursed creature targets you with an attack, it takes 1d4 psychic damage. As a bonus action during your turn or if the cursed creature is killed, you can move this curse to a new target.

## Mindrending Bullet

Enchantment cantrip
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V
Duration: Instantaneous
Your words blend with the gun's loud retort, creating a noise that pierces through the target's psyche. As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a ranged attack with a firearm within the spell's range, otherwise the spell fails. On a hit, the damage dealt by the attack is psychic instead of the normal damage type.

This spell's damage increases when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, the attack deals an extra 1d4 psychic damage to the target. This increases by 1 d 4 at 11 th level (2d4), and 17 th level (3d4).

---

## Poison Gas

1st-level necromancy
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 90 feet
Components: V, S, M (a pinch of nightshade)
Duration: Concentration, 1 minute

# Weapons and Armor 

## Firearms

In order to put guns in a campaign in a way that makes them more than just reskinned bows, here are a list of basic rules for firearms for Dungeons and Dragons.

## General Rules

These are universal rules for every gun found in this book.
Akimbo. If you are proficient with firearms or ranged weapons and are wielding two light firearms or ranged weapons, after you fire one, you can use a bonus action to attack with another light firearm you are holding. You don't add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative.

Misfire (Optional Rule). This rule is made only for games where firearms are prominent, and you wish to emphasize inferiority of primitive firearms. These rules only apply to them in this instance.

If you make an attack roll and the roll matches or is lower than a firearm's misfire number (excluding bonuses), your gun jams. You cannot make an attack with it again until you spend an action to clear the chamber. Your firearm's misfire number then goes up by 1 , to a maximum of 10 . You can spend 1 minute and make a Dexterity (Tinker's tools) or Intelligence (Tinker's tools) check equal to DC $10+$ your gun's misfire number to reduce your gun's misfire number back to the original misfire number.

Primitive Guns (Optional Rule). In games where firearms are prominent, you can use this optional rule. Primitive Firearms with the loading property are not properly built for extended combat. If you make more than two attacks with these weapons in a single round, the firearm's misfire number goes up by 1 , to a maximum of 10 .

Reload \& Long Load. The reload and long load properties specify the number of attacks that can be made with the weapon before it runs out of ammunition. After making the number of attacks specified by the gun's reload/long load number, you must reload the weapon using ammunition on hand before it can be used again.

Ranged weapons with the reload property must be reloaded using an action or bonus action. Ranged weapons with the long load property take an action to reload its ammunition.

If you wield two light ranged weapons with the reload property, you can reload them both at once as an action during your turn.

If you are wielding a light ranged weapon with the reload property in one hand and have your hand occupied by something other than another light ranged weapon with the reload property, the ranged weapon takes an action to reload.

Shell Loading. Firearms with the shell loading property must be reloaded after a certain number of attacks, just like weapons with the reload property. However, reloading must be done by inserting each piece of ammunition in at a time. Fully reloading your gun this way takes an action during your turn. Alternatively, as a bonus action, you can reload up to three pieces of ammunition into the weapon.

## Firearm Properties

The following properties will not be featured universally on every firearm and will vary from gun to gun.

Automatic. Automatic firearms can make a separate attack that releases a salvo of bullets per pull of the trigger. As an action, you can force any creatures of your choice in a 25 -foot square centered on a point within your gun's maximum range to make a Dexterity saving throw, taking the gun's automatic damage (listed in parentheses) on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success. This action subtracts rounds from your gun equal to the number of creatures affected.

Additionally, guns with the automatic property always expend six rounds per attack.

Automatic Save DC (Not Proficient) $=12$
Automatic Save DC (Proficient) $=8+$ your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier

Bayonet. These firearms are built with a blade that can be used for a melee attack. The damage and any other properties of the weapon when used in melee are listed in parentheses. You are not considered proficient in melee attacks made with a bayonet unless you are proficient with improvised weapons.

Bolt-Action. When using a bolt-action firearm, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you make an attack with it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make. After making an attack with this weapon, you must use an action or bonus action to clear the spent cartridge from the weapon before you can fire it again.

Burst Fire. Burst fire firearms are able to make a special attack that releases a stream of multiple bullets. As an action, you can force up to 6 creatures of your choice in a 15 -foot square centered on a point within your gun's maximum range to make a Dexterity saving throw, taking your gun's burst fire damage (listed in parentheses) on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success. This action subtracts rounds from your gun equal to the number of creatures affected, to a maximum of 6 .

Additionally, guns with the burst fire property always expend 3 rounds per attack.

Burst Fire Save DC (Not Proficient) $=12$
Burst Fire Save DC (Proficient) $=8+$ your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier

Bulky. Firearms and ranged weapons with the bulky property have to be made stable via going prone or taking a bonus action to stablize it in order to be fired effectively due to their weight. You cannot attack more than once during your turn while wielding a bulky firearm.

Scatter. Firearms with the scatter property have two types of damage, a regular damage roll and a scatter damage roll. When you make an attack roll with one of these guns against a creature, compare your attack roll to the AC of all creatures within 5 feet of the target. If your attack would hit them, deal the firearm's scatter damage roll to the creatures. You do not add your ability score modifier to the damage of this attack, unless that modifier is negative.

# Proficiency with Firearms 

Firearms are not typical weapons. The nature of their construction and the complexity of their use and care require a special kind of training required to become proficient with them. Unless otherwise specified by the DM, firearms count as a separate proficiency from martial and simple weapons.

There are two types of proficiencies associated with firearms: longarms, which include Two-handed firearms, and sidearms, which include every other kind of firearm. Sidearms can be wielded in one hand.

The general rule of a firearm using Dexterity vs. Strength depends on its weight. If the fire arm weighs 9 lbs . and under it is considered a dexterity Weapon. If the firearm weighs 10 lbs . and over it is considered a Strength weapon.

# Double Barrel Shotgun Special Rules 

Double barrel shotguns can be fired twice per attack. When you make an attack roll with a double barrel shotgun, you can make two attack rolls at the same creature. The second attack roll is made with disadvantage, and on a hit, you do not add your ability score modifier to the damage of that attack, unless your modifier is negative.

## Gunlance and Rilfeblade Special Rules

The gunlance and rilfeblade are equipped with firearms built into the weapon itself giving each the ability to be fired similarly to a firearm. If either is fired within melee range you the weapon deals the melee weapon damage along with the base damage as fire damage. After either is fired the weapon must be reloaded before it can be fired again.

## Handheld Cannon Special Rules

Rather than make a regular attack with this weapon, you can use an action to fire the cannon with extreme force. The round shoots forward in a line, which is 5 feet wide and has a length equal to half the cannon's maximum range. Each creature in that line must make a Dexterity saving throw. The DC of this saving throw is equal to $8+$ your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier. On a failed save, a creature takes 1 d 12 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone.
Additionally, handheld cannons are considered siege weapon that has advantage on attacks against structurs and always crits on a hit.

## Nock Gun Special Rules

You can use your action to fire all 7 barrels of this gun at once. Make an attack roll with disadvantage. If you succeed, roll 7d10 piercing damage. However, the recoil from making this attack deals 7d4 bludgeoning damage to you and forces you to make a DC 10 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

# Applying And Removing Custom Parts 

Any firearm can only have two custom parts at one time. You must build a custom part onto the weapon in order to use it. Doing so takes 1 week of work ( 8 hours per day) and 500 gp of raw materials. Dismantling a custom part takes one day of work ( 8 hours) and 10 gp of raw materials. You must dismantle a custom part to build another onto it if your gun is already at its custom part limit.

## A Note About Attachments \& Custom Parts

Custom parts and attachments are primarily for games where guns are both advanced and commonplace in your worlds. They're made to explicitly make them superior to more primitive weapons. If every character in your current game is not holding at least one gun (excluding Barbarians, Druids, or something equivalent), then it is wise to keep them out or just give those who don't wield guns more magic items and armor to compensate.

## UnIQUE WeAPONS

Modern technology is not limited to firearms. Overall improvements in metalworking and engineering have created unique items even for those who shy away from guns.

## Weapon Properties

Properties not found in official material are detailed below.
Hidden. A weapon with the hidden property is designed to be easily concealed by the holder. If you have proficiency with a hidden weapon, you also gain advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checksto hide the weapon.

Non-lethal Weapons with this property are designed for subdual, and always deal non-lethal damage.

## Special Weapons

Weapons with the special property, as well as items requiring explanation, are detailed below.

Bola. Consisting of a length of cord with weights on each end, this weapon can entangle a target. A Large or smaller creature hit by a bola must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or become grappled until it is freed. A bola has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger.

A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the bola (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the bola.

---

Ball \& Chain. This heavy metal chain is attached to a solid iron ball. It is swung through the air like a flail to deal massive damage. For an additional 10 gp , the ball can be switched out for a blade (slashing) or spike (piercing).

Boot Knife. This spring-loaded blade is hidden on the sole of a heavy boot or shoe. Once you hit its hidden switch to deploy it (as a bonus action), it can be used as an off-hand weapon, even if you are carrying two weapons or a twohanded weapon. While it is deployed, walking is slightly difficult, and you treat normal terrain as difficult and difficult terrain as impassable.

You can re-arm the blade as an action, pushing it back into your boot where it remains hidden.

Buzzsaw. Consisting of a circular sawblade attached to a handheld motor, this device is typically used to cut wooden planks or metal locks, but is is just as effective on flesh. However, using this weapon causes a great deal of noise; the spinning blade and roaring motor can be heard out to a distance of 60 feet if used outside. This distance reduces to 30 feet if you use this weapon indoors.

Cestus. This is a heavy, padded glove that covers the wielder from mid-finger to mid-forearm. It is made of leather or thick cloth and reinforced with metal plates over the fingers.

A monk wielding a cestus can add its damage to thier unarmed strikes, and it counts as a monk weapon for them.

Chakram. This circular, sharp bladed disc is unique, even as far as uncommon weapons go. It can be used for melee attacks or thrown. When it is thrown, it returns to its thrower, and must be caught using a bonus action.

Garrote Wire. This length of thin, sharp wire can only be used on a Medium or Small creature while the user has advantage on the attack roll. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 slashing damage and is grappled. Until the grapple ends, the target cannot breathe, and allies has advantage on attack rolls against the target.

Gauntlet Blade. This weapon, invented by a secret organization, appears to be simple ornate leather bracer. However, when the wielder presses a secret switch, deploying a blade. The same switch retracts the blade, hiding it from view as a bonus action.

While the blade is deployed, you cannot hold anything in your hand.

Grenades and Mines. These small handheld explosives are used by throwing them as an action. Choose a point anywhere within a maximum distance of 5 times your Strength modifier. When the grenade reaches that point, it detonates, forcing everyone in an area centered on that point to make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes damage based on the type of grenade used; on a successful save, it takes half as much damage.

Alternatively, a mine can be planted in the ground, hidden from sight and triggered when a creature steps on it. Planting a mine takes 1 minute. A creature moving more than half its speed that moves into the mine's space must succeed a Dexterity saving throw or take damage as above. If a creature is moving at half speed or slower, the DC of this saving throw is reduced to 10 .

A creature looking for traps can make an Intelligence (Investigation) check contested by your Dexterity (Sleight of Hand), Charisma (Deception), or Intelligence (Deception), whichever is higher. On a success, your mine is discovered.

A creature aware of the mine after it is discovered takes only half damage on a failed save, or no damage on a successful one.

Lightning Baton. This metal rod has two sharp prongs at its tip and is designed to subdue enemies without killing them. With the push of a button, electricity sparks across the tip of the rod.

If the rod is dropped into water at least ankle-high, each creature in the water must succeed a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take damage as if critically hit by this weapon. This effect also applies if the target is wet.

Sawtooth Sword. This serrated blade causes grievous wounds when used correctly, as its jagged edge shreds and deepens cuts. When you make an attack with this weapon, if you roll a 19 or 20 and hit, the target begins bleeding out, taking 1 d 4 slashing damage at the beginning of each of its turns until it takes an action to stop the bleeding.

Stiletto Knife and Switch Blade. These are knives with spring-loaded blades. Small, easy to conceal... and illegal in many cities.

Walking Cane. This seemingly normal cane is actually a clever and elegant hidden sheath for a blade. The blade can be unsheathed as part of the action used to attack with this weapon. This blade functions as a mundane rapier or dagger (depending on the construction of the cane).

# Modern Armor 

## Ballistics Resistance and Damage Reduction

With the increase in the effectiveness of ranged weaponry, armorers needed to follow suit. Improvements in metallurgy and engineering have created better, stronger materials designed to withstand the force of a bullet.

Armor developers have devised many different ways to minimize the damage from firearms. Some use thicker metal plating; others use multiple layers of thick cloth and tightly woven metal; still others use magical means. Regardless of the method, these improvements are all represented by a new property: ballistics resistance.

Armor with ballistics resistance have the designation BR followed by a number. When an enemy makes an attack with a firearm against you, your get a bonus to your AC equal to this BR number. For example, if you are wearing a Light Undercover Shirt, your base armor class is $11+$ your Dexterity modifier. With a modifier of 3 , you have an armor class of 14 . When you are attacked with a firearm, the shirt's ballistics resistance gives you a +2 bonus, so now your armor class is 16 against that attack. Of course, ballistics resistance doesn't do much against a sword!

Heavy armor does not benefit from ballistics resistance; instead they have a propety called damage reduction, or DR. When hit by a round from a firearm that does not ignore armor, the damage is reduced by an amount equal to the DR number + the wearer's Constitution modifier.

# MAGIC ITEMS 

## Ammunition, Returning

Wondrous item, rare
This piece of ammunition can take the form of an arrow, sling bullet, crossbow bolt, or gun round. The first time you make an attack with a ranged weapon or firearm using this piece of ammunition, it teleports back into your hands or directly into your firearm, regardless of whether the attack hit or not. After this, every time you fire this piece of ammunition, it has a $50 \%$ chance of returning to your inventory. This ammunition can always be recovered after a combat.

## Ammunition, Trager

Wondrous item, very rare
When you make an attack roll with a ranged weapon using this piece of ammunition, it has advantage. On a hit, the round begins to glow with white-green light, drawing further attacks towards the same spot. The next creature that makes an attack roll against a creature hit by this ammunition makes the roll with advantage, and on a hit, the creature's attack deals an extra 1d8 damage. The ammunition then loses its magic.

This ammunition can always be recovered after a combat if it does not hit a creature.

## Amulet of Intervention

Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
This amulet takes the shape of a large golden square. It has red and green gems inlaid on one side and engraved with the image of a pair of wings on the other side. When worn, it protects you from disaster and wards away death.

Guardian Angel. If you would be subjected to an effect that would reduce you to 0 hit points, the amulet automatically activates. A golden sphere of light bursts forth, negating the damage dealt and rendering you immune to all damage and all conditions. This sphere lasts for up to 1 round before fading away. Once this ability is activated, the amulet loses its magic until the next dawn.

## Abyss Ring

Ring, rare (requires attunement)
This silver ring is has shards of jagged obsidian along the outside and has three small rubies inset at equal lengths away from each other that seem to glow even without any light around to reflect.

Each gem holds a single charge, for a total of three charges. The ring regains $1 \mathrm{~d} 4+1$ expended charges daily at dawn as long as you are not looking at it when it recharges.

While wearing the Abyss Ring, you can expend a charge to cast invisibility on yourself. Rather than requiring concentration, the spell maintains itself only as long as you can hold your breath. (Follow the rules for suffocation detailed in the Player's Handbook.)

---

## Artemis Cannon

Weapon (rifle), very rare (requires attunement)
This weapon is decorated with the holy symbol of Artemis, a bow over the lunar disc, carved deeply and carefully into the stock. The entire rifle feels like it was made for a hunter.

This +1 rifle deals an extra 1d4 force damage on a hit. Additionally, this weapon has 4 charges. You can expend one charge to cast conjure barrage, or you can expend 2 charges to cast conjure volley. When casting either of these spells, you can exclude a number of creatures from the spell's effect up to $2+$ your Dexterity or Wisdom modifier. The save DC for these spells is 16 .

The weapon regains 1d4 expended charges daily at midnight if its holy symbol is held under the light of the moon.

## AsHes to AsHes

Weapon (flintlock pistol), very rare (requires attunement) Ornate red and orange runes flicker across the surface of this dark steel weapon like embers. This +1 flintlock pistol deals an extra 1 d 8 fire damage on a hit.

Additionally, after firing this weapon, a swirling cloud of gunsmoke and embers appears in a 5 -foot radius around you. The cloud spreads around corners and is heavily obscured. The cloud remains until the start of your next turn or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.

When the cloud appears, each creature in its are except for you within it must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. A creature must also make this saving throw when it enters the cloud for the first time or ends its turn there. A creature takes 3 d 8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

## Bandolier of Blades

## Wondrous Item, rare

This hard leather bandolier is lined with woolen cord. Its pouch glows with a faint yellow light, and has slots for four daggers. A nonmagical dagger placed in this bandolier is infused with magic, and when it is drawn from the bandolier it acts as a +1 dagger for 1 minute. If the dagger is thrown during this duration, it automatically reappears within the bandolier as long as it is on the same plane as the thrower. You can draw a dagger from the bandolier as part of the action used to attack with it.

## Bells of the Meticulous Magician

Wondrous Item, very rare
Three golden bells sit in a small, leather-bound case that attaches to the waist. The first a pyramid-shaped bell with 4 triangular emeralds. The second is a cylindrical bell with 4 oval sapphires, and the last is a cube-shaped bell with 4 square rubies inset. The gems on the bells give off a faint glow, tinting them green, blue, and red respectively. Each bell holds four charges, represented by each of the four gemstones inlaid into its surface; as a bonus action, you can ring one of the bells, expending one charge. Each bell regains one expended charge daily at dawn.

The sound of a bell can be heard clearly out to 15 feet, and faintly for another 15 feet.

Pyramid Bell The sharp sound of this bell causes a surface you choose to give off a faint green glow. This glow reveals the presence of hidden objects, fixtures, or passages behind or beneath the surface, but only if the DC for finding the object is 15 or lower. The pyramid bell can only affect a surface no larger than a square 5 feet on a side.

Cylinder Bell The tinkling chime of this bell sounds like a set of keys. When rung, a single nonmagical lock or simple trap you can see glows a faint blue. If the DC to unlock the lock or disarm the trap is 15 or lower, the bell's magic unlocks or disarms it. The object affected this way can be no larger than 10 feet in any dimension.

Cube Bell The low drone of this bell seems to resonate with the weave of magic itself. A soft, red glow appears on an object or surface you can see, dispelling a single magical trap or magical lock that has a DC of 15 or lower. The object affected this way must fit within a square 5 feet on a side.

## Bola of Dimensional Anchoring

Weapon (bola), rare
This bola is made of three mirrored steel spheres connected by lengths of steel chain. An abjuration rune is emblazoned on each of the spheres.

The bola functions as a mundane bola, except the save DC to avoid grapple is 15 . The bola prevents a creature grappled by it from using any method of extradimensional movement, including teleportation or travel to a different plane of existence. It doesn't prevent the creature from passing through an interdimensional portal.

You and any creature you designate when you use the bola can use an action to remove it. Once every 30 days, the bound creature can make a DC 30 Strength (Athletics) check. On a success, the creature breaks free and destroys the bola.

## Compass of Magical Scrying

Wondrous Item, rare (requires attunement)
The compass points in the general direction of the highest concentration of magic in the vicinity. You can also use this compass to track a "magical trail" in much the same way that you would follow physical tracks. To do so, roll a Wisdom (Survival) check. The DC starts at 10 and increases by 5 for each hour that has passed since the source of magic was present.

![img-14.jpeg](assets/The%20Homebrewery%20Steampunk_img-14.jpeg)

## Clockwork Wings

## Armor (studded leather) rare

This armor has a pair of wings made of clockwork, strong fabric, and metal sheets attached to the back. Though magic provides the power and propulsion, it is the wings that are responsible for the fine control required for continuous, smooth flight.
While you wear this armor, you can use a bonus action to unfold the wings. While they are unfolded, you have a flying speed of 30 feet and full control of your movement. You can use the wings to fly for up to 8 hours, all at once or in several shorter flights, each one using a minimum of 1 minute from the duration. However, for every full hour of flight, you must spend time during a short or long rest to perform minor repairs and maintenance to the wings. This maintenance requires tinker's tools to perform, and it takes 15 minutes and costs 20 gp worth of raw materials per full hour of flight used.
If you fly for a total of 8 hours without repairing the wings, they break mid-flight. Roll a percentile dice. On a result of 25 or lower, the wings are locked and immobile. You must use your action each turn to glide at a rate of 30 feet per round, descending a maximum of 10 feet per round until you reach the ground. On a result over 25 , or if you do not use your action to glide as above, you fall to the ground and must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw to land safely. On a failed save, you take falling damage as normal for your height, landing prone. On a successful save, you take half as much damage and do not land prone.
After the wings break, you must use tinker's tools to spend at least 1 hour and 80 gp worth of parts to restore partial functionality to the device. When partially repaired, the device's flight time is limited to 4 hours and your flight speed becomes 25 feet. Only when you spend a total of 2 hours and 160 gp worth of raw materials repairing it will you restore full functionality.
If you use the wings in combat, your ranged attack rolls have disadvantage unless you are hovering. If you are knocked prone while flying, you can make a DC 15 Dexterity save to avoid falling.

## DEMONSKIN CLOAK

Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by a by a warlock, sorcerer, or wizard)
This ankle-length hooded cloak looks similar to red leather from a distance. Upon closer inspection, the hood is made up of small, thin scales, and the rest of the cloak is thin and membranous, with thin tubes running down the length of it that give it the look of large bat wings.
This cloak has four charges, and regains $1 \mathrm{~d} 4+1$ expended charges daily at dawn.
While attuned to this cloak, you can use your reaction to expend a charge and cause the cloak to flap up and envelop you. While enveloped, you get a +5 bonus to AC, including against the triggering attack, as with the shield spell. Additionally, spells and attacks cannot target you or deal damage to you. However, while enveloped, you are blinded and restrained.
You remain enveloped by the cloak until the start of your next turn.

## Dragonscale Cloak

Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
This beautiful cloak is made from the hide and scales of a dragon. The look and feel (and name) of this cloak depend on the dragon whose hide it is made from. A Red Dragonscale cloak, for example may feel warm to the touch, or a Black. Dragonscale cloak may appear to be constantly cast in shadow.
Regardless of the hide this cloak is made out of, the inherent magic captured in the dragon's scales allows the wearer of this cloak to cast mage armor on themselves once per long rest. The cloak also grants resistance to the damage type that the dragon whose scales it was made from had immunity to.

---

## Dragon Gannon

Weapon (any firearm with the scatter property), legendary (requires attunement)
This gun is molded in the fearsome image of a particular dragon, seeming to come alive in your hands. You get a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. Depending on which dragon it's made to look like, this weapon deals an additional 1d4 damage of the type associated with that dragon.

As an action, you can speak this weapon's command word and fire out a burst of energy in a line or cone. The shape, damage, damage type, and saving throw of this attack is identical to that of the breath weapon of a young dragon of the appopriate color. After making this attack, as long as you have this firearm drawn, roll a d6 at the start of each of your subsequent turns. On a 6, the breath weapon recharges, and you can use it again.

This weapon's name is typically based on the dragon it was sculpted after (i.e. Bronze Dragon Cannon).

## Event Horizon

Weapon (shotgun), legendary (requires attunement) This weapon feels incredibly dense, dark, and cold, as if holding it threatens to draw you into it. You gain a +2 to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.

You can use an action to expend 1 charge to use the Singularity ability. This gun has 3 charges, and regains 1d3 charges after a long rest.

Singularity. Make an attack roll against a target within range, and compare the attack roll to the AC of all creatures within 5 feet of the target. Including the target, each creature that would be hit by the attack takes 4 d 6 force damage and makes a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is drawn towards a small, dark sphere located at the point where the attack originated from and pulled into it. Each creature pulled in this way is subjected ot the effects of the spell teleport (Player's Handbook, p. 281), with a destination that you have in mind. You must have seen this destination at least casually.

## Ethereal Gauntlets

Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
These gauntlets appear to be ordinary, nonmagical leather, only revealing their magical properties in the right situation. While attuned to these gloves, if you come in contact with an undead creature immune to the grappled condition, that creature loses that immunity, and you have advantage on Strength and Dexterity checks involving grappling that creature.
![img-15.jpeg](assets/The%20Homebrewery%20Steampunk_img-15.jpeg)

## Ghostflame Gandle

Wondrous item, uncommon
When you light this candle and speak its command word, the flame turns a shimmering silver. The silver flame sheds bright light out to a 30 -foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. Only the holder of the candle can see this light.

Additionally, the silver flame can be used to light ordinary light sources, such as lanterns and torches. The flame's properties transfer to the new light source.

## Heward's Magnificent Multitool

Wondrous item, uncommon
This folded pocket knife has a number of metal compartments with tools that slide or fold out of the body more than it reasonably looks like it should have. Despite your efforts, you still haven't found the actual knife compartment.

This item can be used in place of tinker's tools, thieves' tools, and two other types of artisan's tools (chosen by the DM), though you do so at a -3 penalty due to the difficulty of finding the right compartment to use.

## Jack's Ring

Ring, legendary (requires attunement by a Neutral or Evil character)
This old, golden ring looks as though it may be worth upwards of 10,000 gp. It has a tiny dark red stain on it that can't be cleaned off.

Drain. A phrase, unknown to you, but familiar to Jack, burns in your mind. You can use your action to say this phrase. When you do, the ring burns brightly as that hand reaches out towards your opponent. Make an unarmed melee attack against a creature within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the target must succeed a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 6 d 4 necrotic damage. You regain hit points equal to the necrotic damage you dealt. You must wait one hour before you can use this feature again.

Bloodied Blade. When you make an attack against a creature who is either surprised or unaware of your presence, it deals an additional 1d8 damage if it hits.

Curse. This ring is possessed by the essence of a serial murderer named Jack the Ripper. Donning this ring lets his influence take hold. Once attuned, you may not take the ring off by any means other than the wish spell.

Sentience. Jack's Ring is a sentient chaotic evil ring with an Intelligence of 18, Wisdom of 24, and Charisma of 22. It has hearing and darkvision out to 60 feet. It speaks telepathically to its wearer in a deep, smooth baritone with a touch of madness at its edges. It understands and speaks Common, Dwarvish, Elvish, Giant, Gnomish, Primordial, and Infernal.

Personality. Jack's Ring takes pleasure only in violence, and its goal is to shape its wearer into a killer worthy of the moniker "The Ripper". It is incredibly talkative and constantly speaks to its wearer, even offering suggestions for courses of action that will encourage more bloodshed. In combat, it often makes comments such as "Yes, more...", "He looks weak, finish the job", etc.

## Lucky Seven

Weapon (revolver), legendary (requires attunement)
This gun has lines of pure gold swirling across its barrel and green four-leaf clovers etched on its grip. It sparkles dimly in your hands, making every shot feel like you're gambling for something big. You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls you make with this revolver.

Uncanny Luck. You get the lucky feat if you do not have it already while attuned to this firearm. Additionally, once per turn, when rolling this weapon's damage, you can reroll any number of dice that had a result of 1 or 2 .

Seven of Clovers. If you roll a natural 7 on an attack roll made with this revolver, you hear the sound of bells and jingling coins as the weapon begins to glow. This attack automatically hits its target, is considered a critical hit, and deals maximum damage. For the next 7 minutes, attacks made with this weapon (including this one) deal an extra 7 force damage.

## Mask of the Final Dream

Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a bard, cleric, druid, or paladin)

## MASK OF THE Plague Doctor

Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a cleric, druid, or paladin)
A multicolored leather mask is decorated with an elongated beak, goggles in the eye holes and metal clips. The beak is stuffed with various flora of an alchemic nature. When attuned, the enchantments on the flora in the mask make its wearer immune to disease and poison, so long as the disease or poison is not directly administered to the wearer via injection or wound.

Curse. The mask has no negative benefit while worn, but if it is removed voluntarily, the wearer gains vulnerability to poison damage and the poisoned condition, and his or her hit point maximum is reduced by half until his or her next long rest.

This effect can be suppressed with the use of dispel magic. The dispel DC is equal to the wearer's spell save DC. Once dispelled, the caster takes poison damage equal to half the wearer's current hit points. The curse remains suppressed until the next dawn.

## Mane of the Chimera

Armor (hide), very rare (requires attunment)
This hide armor is made with a silken white, red, and brown mane taken from a body of a chimera and is imbued with magical enhancements. When a creature dons the armor for the first time, it must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the wearer takes 10d4 psychic damage, fails to attune to the armor, and cannot try again for 48 hours. On a succeesful save they are deemed worthy and attune to the armor, gaining the following benefits; only one of the armor's abilities can be active at a time, and once used, it cannot be used again until the next dawn:

Draconic Wings. As an action, large leathery dragon wings sprout from the armor, giving you a flying speed of 20 feet with the ability to hover for 1 minute. While this benefit is active, you have disadvantage on Dexterity-based saving throws.

Lion's Roar. As a bonus action you let out a powerful roar. Any allies within 10 feet of you, including yourself, gain advantage on their next three melee attack rolls. If any of those three attacks hit, it deals an additional 1d6 damage.

Ram's Horns. As a bonus action you can grow large spiral ram-like horns for 1 minute. While this benefit is active, if you move at least 20 feet towards a creature, you can make a charge attack with the horns with a +7 attack bonus. On a hit, the target takes 2 d 10 force damage and is pushed 5 feet away from you.

## Mirror of True Reflecting

Wondrous item, rare
This small hand mirror has the image of a blindfolded angel engraved on its reverse side. It has five charges, regaining $1 \mathrm{~d} 4+1$ expended charges daily at dawn.
As an action, you can speak its command word and expend one of its charges to cause the mirror's reflective surface to glow along its edge. For the next minute, you can view creatures and objects reflected in the mirror as if you had truesight.

## Ollias' Gauntlet of Manipulation

Wondrous Item, legendary
A shimmering golden gauntlet encrusted with glowing blue gems sits atop a pedestal, trapped behind a field of arcing electricity. A man suddenly bypasses its protective barrier and slips it on, feeling its significant, yet familiar and comfortable weight. He places it to his ear, hearing a low hum that groans of locked away power, that whispers promises of might and virtue. The brilliant doctor, Ollias, master of machines, is happy to be reunited with his favorite toy.

While worn, this gauntlet allows the wearer to manipulate the gravity of objects and creatures alike. The gauntlet has three pull charges and three push charges, regaining 1d4 +2 expended charges daily at dawn.

Pull. As an action, the wearer can expend one pull charge to pull a single object or creature it can see towards it for a distance of up to half the wearer's speed. The target must weigh no more than twice the wearer's weight, and a creature can make a DC 16 Strength saving throw to resist this movement.

Push. As an action, the wearer can expend one push charge to pull a single object or creature it can see towards it for a distance of up to twice the wearer's speed. The target must weigh no more than twice the wearer's weight, and a creature can make a DC 16 Strength saving throw to resist this movement.

Crushing Gravity. As an action, the wearer can expend 2 push and 2 pull charges to create an area of intense gravity in a 20 -foot-radius sphere originating from a point it can see within 40 feet. Each creature in this area falls to the ground and must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be restrained until the effect ends. A creature restrained this way can repeat the save at the end of each of their subsequent turns, ending the effect on itself on a success and taking force damage equal to half their total hit die on a failure.

## Pyre's Anguish / Frost Pain

Weapon (any sword), legendary (requires attunment)
Pyre's Anguish and Frost Pain, while very different blades, are actually one in the same. This blade represents the duality of fire and ice, producing either powerful flames or shards of freezing ice alternately.

During the day, Pyre's Anguish is a crimson blade adorned with flame patterns along its edge. While attuned to the blade in this state, it deals an additional 1d6 fire damage on a hit, and you have resistance to fire damage. Pyre's Anguish also has 4 charges, and regains $1 \mathrm{~d} 4+1$ expended charges daily at dawn. These charges can be used for the following abilities:

- Spell Blade. You can expend one charge to cast fire bolt, two charges to cast fireball, and three charges to cast wall of fire (spell attack bonus +7 , save DC 15).
- Chaos Flame. As an action, you can expend three charges to cause molten lava to erupt from the earth. Five bursts of lava erupt from the ground at points up to 60 feet away from you, each one filling a 10 -foot-high cylinder 10 feet in diameter. The bursts cannot be more than 15 feet apart. Each creature in the affected areas must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 d 8 fire damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one.

The crimson blade of Pyre's Anguish shifts to a cold light blue alongside the setting of the sun and the rise of the moon, seeming to be formed entirely of ice. Pyre's Anguish undergoes the transformation into Frost Pain automatically at sunset. While attuned to the blade while it has become Frost Pain, it deals an additional 1d6 cold damage on a hit, and you have resistance to cold damage. Frost Pain also has 4 charges, regaining $1 \mathrm{~d} 4+1$ expended charges daily at sunset. These charges can be used for the following abilities:

- Spell Blade. You can expend one charge to cast ray of frost, two charges to cast Snilloc's snowball swarm, and three to cast ice storm (spell attack bonus +7 , save DC 15).
- Icy Burst. As an action, you can expend three charges to create a 60 -foot-radius sphere of ice and snow originating from a point you can see up to 90 feet away. When the sphere appears, each creature in its area must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4 d 6 cold damage and 4 d 6 bludgeoning damage and its movement becomes 10 feet for 1 minute. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't slowed.


## Rifle of Endless Torrent

Weapon (rifle), very rare (requires attunement)
Forged from shards of a decanter of endless water, this rifle maintains its connection to the Elemental Plane of Water. It does not consume ammunition, instead firing water out of its barrel. It has two settings:

- Stream. This is a concentrated burst of water that strikes an opponent. Make an attack roll as normal; on a hit, it deals 1d12 bludgeoning damage.
- Torrent. Before making an attack with this setting, you must use a bonus action to speak the command word, "torrent". This attack is a large beam of water that shoots forward in a line 5 feet wide and 30 feet long. Each creature in that line must make a DC 14 Strength saving throw. A creature takes 3 d 12 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone on a failed save. It takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone on a successful save.


## Ring of Iron Sight

Ring, rare (requires attunement)
This rusted iron band has a forked protrusion on it shaped like the sights of a gun. While attuned to this item, the maximum range of firearms you wield increases by half.

Additionally, the ring has four charges. While wearing it, you can use your bonus action and expend one charge to sight a target within the maximum range of your firearm. If you do, you do not have disadvantage on the attack roll if the target is beyond the gun's normal range.

The ring regains 1 d 4 expended charges after a short or long rest.

## Ring of Snapback

Ring, very rare
This silver ring is an ornate band adorned with two green gemstones in the shape of an hourglass turned on its side. As an action you can tap the ring, instantly teleporting back to the space you occupied 1 round ( 6 seconds) ago. If that space is occupied, the creature in it is immediately pushed into the nearest available unoccupied space and must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 2d8 force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

---

## Round, Double Tap

Wondrous item, uncommon
When you attack with your firearm using this round, regardless of whether or not you hit, you can repeat the attack roll against the same target at the beginning of your next turn. If the creature was brought to 0 hit points by the round on the first attack, you can instead make the second attack roll at a different target within 30 feet of the of the original creature at the beginning of your next turn instead. If you don't, this ammunition drops to the ground harmlessly.

This round retains its magic until two consecutive attacks made with it hit a target. After this, it becomes mundane.

## Round, Spell Bullet

Wondrous item, rarity varies depending on the spell This round is a spell bullet that holds a spell of the DM's choice. When fired out of a firearm, the spell is cast following the rules as detailed in the Spellshooter's Arcane Ammunition feature. If you have a class feature that allows you to cast spells, the spell bullet uses your spellcasting ability, spell attack bonus, and save DC; otherwise it is cast using a +5 bonus and a save DC of 13 .

## The Silent Terror

Weapon (pistol), very rare (requires attunement)
This +2 pistol comes with a built in suppressor enchanted with shadow magic that renders it completely silent. No muzzle flare appears from this gun, and it is almost entirely silent when fired.

Once per turn, you can deal an extra 3d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack with this weapon if you have advantage on the attack roll. You don't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't incapacitated, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

Additionally, if you fire this gun while hidden, each creature within 10 feet of you can make a Wisdom (Perception) check against your attack roll, applying a +5 bonus to their result. On a successful check, you are no longer hidden to that creature.

## Six of Stars

Weapon (revolver), very rare (requires attunement)
This +2 revolver was forged from the alloy found in a meteor and enchanted with its stardust. It has 6 charges, which can be expended to use the following abilities:

- When making an attack with this gun, you can expend 2 charges to turn the round into a meteorite. This is identical to a meteor from Melf's minute meteors (save DC 14). You can expend additional charges to increase the damage dealt by 1 d 6 .
- As a bonus action, you can expend 1 charge to infuse the remaining rounds in your gun with magic from the stars. For the next minute or until you reload this gun, your attacks with it deal 1d6 additional force or fire damage (your choice).

This weapon regains 1d6 expended charges whenever you complete a long rest, as long as it has a view of the sky.

## Skeleton Key

Wondrous item, legendary
This golden key is sculpted in the likeness of a skull and long bones, with small rubies inlaid in the eye holes of the skull. It magically changes its size, shape, and configuration, allowing you to unlock any lock - including those on a door or chest without making any tool checks.

---

## Strange Guardian's Revolver

Weapon (hand cannon), legendary (requires attunement) This large magnum hand cannon has a fine dark silver body with a pearlescent grip. When you first attune to it, you hear a faint melody and get the strangest feeling that you are being watched... or, perhaps, that there is a stranger, somewhere, looking out for your well being.

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls you make with this hand cannon, and you score a critical hit with it on a roll of 19 or 20 . While attuned to this weapon, you have advantage on Charisma checks against creatures who do not know you personally (i.e. people who don't know your name and face).

Intimidating Critical. When you score a critical hit with this hand cannon, the creature you hit must succeed a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. A creature that knows you personally automatically succeeds this saving throw. An affected creature can attempt the saving throw again at the end of each of its subsequent turns, ending the effect on itself if it succeeds. A creature that succeeds the saving throw is immune to this weapon's fright effect for 12 hours.

The Strange Guardian. When you take the attack action on your turn against a creature with 150 hit points or less, roll a d100. On a 10 or lower, a melody like a dramatic flourish fills the air, heralding the arrival of the Strange Guardian. This mysterious spectral figure manifests itself in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you at the end of your turn. It then makes three hand cannon attacks ( +19 to hit) against the creature that you attacked, tips its hat to you, and vanishes as the same dramatic musical stab resounds in the air.

The Strange Guardian cannot be harmed or targeted by attacks, spells, or damaging areas of effect. The +3 hand cannon it wields looks identical to the one you hold. It deals $4 d 6+19$ piercing damage and 3 d 4 force damage that ignores resistance and immunity on a hit.

## Tesla Langer

Weapon (tesla rifle), legendary (requires attunement) Sleek and ornate, this firearm is a bit smaller and more compact than your average longarm, even among other tesla rifles. Its unimposing presence is made up for in its very unique abilities.

This +2 tesla rifle does not have the burst fire property. Instead, it has four charges; as an action, instead of making a normal attack with the rifle, you can expend one charge to sound off a powerful, thunderous blast as it shoots a brilliant blue beam of pure lightning. On a hit, the target takes an additional 3d6 thunder damage and must succeed a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or become stunned for one round. Additionally, each other creature within 15 feet of the target must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 8d8 lightning damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one.

The recoil from firing the rifle this way threatens to throw you off your feet; you must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you are pushed 15 feet in the opposite direction of your attack and knocked prone; you are only pushed 5 feet and not knocked prone on a successful save.

This gun regains $1 \mathrm{~d} 4+1$ expended charges at the end of a long rest.

## Trick-SleEVEd Shirt

Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a card master) This white-collared, long-sleeved button down shirt seems to stay immaculately clean, even in the dirtiest and dustiest conditions. Additionally, one of the sleeves holds a very small extradimensional space, accessed by reaching into the space between the forearm and the sleeve. This space has enough room to hold a single card, or an item of a similar shape and size.

A card master attuned to this garment can place a single spell card from their collection in this space as part of the same rest used to prepare their deck. As a bonus action, you can perform a DC 11 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to switch one of the cards in your hand with the one hidden up your sleeve, enabling you to cast that spell as if it were in your hand. Alternatively, you can perform a DC 16 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to simply add the card in your sleeve to your hand, so long as you do not exceed your maximum hand size.

## Vortex Pistol

Weapon (pistol), rare (requires attunement)
This weapon is forged oddly, seeming to contain swirls of both light and dark metal, purposefully arranged in a sprial pattern down the barrel of the gun. A topaz in the shape of a lightning bolt is inlaid in the pistol's wooden grip. This pistol deals an additional 1d4 lightning damage on a hit.

Vortex Round. You can spend an action to charge this pistol with swirling energy. When you next take the attack action on your next turn, the first shot fired from this pistol that hits a target forms an unstable barometric and gravitic anomaly that draws creatures into it. If you miss with the weapon, you must charge it again.

The vortex forms in the same space as the target of the attack, and fills a 10 -foot-radius sphere originating from that point. Any creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the vortex must succeed a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be pulled into the closest unoccupied space within the vortex's area. A creature within the vortex must remake this saving throw if it wishes to leave its boundaries. If a creature ends its turn within the vortex, it takes 1 d 6 force damage.

The vortex collapses on itself at the start of your next turn, releasing a burst of lightning and energy. When the vortex detonates, each creature within its boundaries takes 2 d 6 lightning and 2 d 6 force damage.

## Weapon, Watertuned

Weapon (any ranged weapon), uncommon
This weapon has had its functional parts magically and mechanically sealed to allow the gun to function, even when immersed in deep water. You may use this ranged weapon normally underwater - that is, your attacks do not have disadvantage when attacking a creature within the weapon's normal range, and your attacks against creatures out to the weapon's maximum range do not automatically miss.

---

## Wendigo Skull

Wondrous Item, legendary (requires attunement)
The wendigo skull is an item that resembles a large, pale, white cervine skull with tall antlers, deep sunken eye sockets and runic markings carved on its surface. The wendigo is a legendary creature known for its insatiable hunger and murderous tendencies.

When a creature not yet attuned to it gets within 20 feet of it, they begin to hear distant whispers, sounding like an elderly man repeating words to himself: "So cold... so hungry... must eat... can't eat... so... lonely... so cold..." The whispering continues until the skull is out of range or until a creature picks it up.

Curse. A creature holding the item is compelled to put it on their head. When first holding the skull, and each morning upon completing a long rest, the creature must make a Wisdom saving throw to resist this urge. The DC for this saving throw is 14 , and it increases by 1 for each subsequent successful save.

On a failed save, the creature puts on the skull, and it merges with the wearer's head, binding it to the wearer. It cannot be removed unless the creature dies.

While worn, the skull gives its wearer the following features:

Hallowed Eyes. Once worn the wearer gains darkvision out to 60 feet. If the wearer already has darkvision, their range is doubled, to a maximum of 120 feet.

Insatiable Hunger. While attuned, you are afflicted with an agonizing hunger that cannot be satiated with normal food. Every day, you must consume at least 5 pounds of flesh from a humanoid that is either alive, or has died within the last week. You can choose to consume up to 1 pound of this flesh from your own body, but you must remove it yourself, and any hit points lost as a result of this self-mutilation also reduces your hit point maximum by the same amount.

Failure to eat flesh within 24 hours will cause you to change into a wendigo (What Lurks in Shadows p. 29). You are also compelled to consume the nearest humanoid creature close to you. For each 24 hours spent without consuming flesh after this point, you gain one level of exhaustion that cannot be removed until you eat the required amount of flesh or die.

Upon your death, the hunger of the wendigo skull will finally consume your body before returning to a dormant state.

Wendigo Transformation. Once per day, you can change into a wendigo, taking on its physical and mental characteristics. When you do this, you can also summon two additional wendigo in unoccupied spaces up to 10 feet away from you. These wendigo act immediately after you in initiative order and are considered allies, but are not under your control. They will attack anything you consider hostile at the time you summon them, and will leave your allies alone as long as they are not attacked. When all creatures you consider hostile have been eliminated, you return to your normal form and the wendigo you summoned disappear.

Whenever you use this ability, make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, you temporarily see your allies as hostile creatures to you, making them open to attack by your wendigo allies. You can remake the saving throw at the end of each of your turns, ending the effect on a success.

## Wind Cannon

Weapon (shotgun), very rare (requires attunement)
This large cannon only resembles a shotgun in the barest sense of the word. With no real place to load ammunition, it is more reminiscent of a large metal tube with a stock attached. The trigger mechanism is connected to a conjuration rune tied to the Elemental Plane of Air.

This +3 shotgun shoots a gust of wind that deals magical slashing damage on a hit instead of its normal damage. This weapon does not run out of ammunition, and does not need to be reloaded. It can function underwater, as the air shifts the water, forming currents that deal bludgeoning damage instead of slashing. If it is shot while within a volcano or similarly hot climate, the superheated air deals fire damage instead of slashing.

Wind Blast. You can make a special attack with this cannon that fires out a gust of powerful wind in a 30 foot cone centered on you. Creatures within the cone must make a DC 14 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4 d 12 slashing damage and is pushed back 15 feet. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and is pushed back 5 feet.

## Artifacts

The artifacts presented here are provided as examples. Use them as guides when creating your own artifacts, or modify them as you see fit.

## Lycan's Bane

Weapon (longsword) artifact (requires attunement)
This sword was created by the paladins of Lunum, the moon god. This sword was created to fight the swarms of werewolves that were destroying the land. This sword has a gem in its pommel that is clear, round, and glows in a way that emulates the phases of the moon. The blade itself is silver, seeming to glow with faint moonlight.

This longsword deals an additional 2d6 radiant damage when it hits. When used against a creature afflicted with the curse of lycanthropy, attack rolls against it are made with advantage. Additionally, the first time a creature afflicted with lycanthropy is hit with this weapon, it automatically becomes a critical hit.

Silver Weapon. Lycan's Bane is a silvered weapon.
Silver Salvation. Lycan's Bane holds 5 charges. A charge can be expended to activate one of the following abilities:

- You pray to the moon god Lunum with the blade in hand, and your senses open, allowing you to identify all creatures with the curse of lycanthropy within a 60 -foot radius.
- You hold the flat of the blade to the heart of a willing or incapacitated creature that has the lycanthropic curse, drawing the affliction from their body and curing them. Removing the curse this way takes 1 minute.
- You hold Lycan's Bane up to the sky, pommel up. The clear gem will shine with a faint white light, turning werewolves nearby. Creatures afflicted by lycanthropy that are within 30 feet of you have disadvantage on attack roll while in this radius. Each affected creature also suffers the effects of the bane spell, and must succeed a DC 16 Charisma saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute.

Lycan's Bane regains all expended charges daily at each moonrise.

The sword is powerless on moonless nights. All evil creatures with the curse of lycanthropy that see you with this sword will be openly hostile to you and those in your immediate party.

Destroying Lycan's Bane. The sword can only be destroyed using a dark ritual which can only take place on a moonless night. The ritual involves sprinkling the blood of 3 willing creatures with any type of lycanthropy on the blade while whispering the correct incantations. This ritual leaves the blade magicless and vulnerable, allowing it to be melted down in a fire - though if the sword is recovered before this occurs, a priest of Lunum can restore its magic by conferring his blessing.

## Sworn Pactbreaker

Weapon (war scythe) artifact (requires attunement) Legend says that the Sworn Pactbreaker was wielded by the champion of the Thalyot family for over a century, dispatching justice and freeing enslaved peoples from blood pacts with demons, devils, and other evil outsiders, typically by destroying the demons responsible. This incredibly sleek black scythe sports a sturdy blood red oak shaft, and its blade is made up of a jagged, razor sharp edge that calls to mind the teeth of a fearsome dragon.

Before attuning to the weapon, the prospective wielder must survive three trials.

- The First Trial Upon first holding the scythe, a wellspring of voices resonates in the wielder's head, chanting loudly and violently in multiple languages, "Cut the ties. Set them free. Break the bonds." The chanting lasts for up to an hour, starting off barely audible but growing louder with every passing minute. The wielder must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw to withstand the overwhelming pressure of these voices. On a failed save, they are deemed unworthy and immediately drop the weapon at their feet; they are unable to wield the Sworn Pactbreaker, let alone touch it. This effect lasts for $1 \mathrm{~d} 4+2$ days, upon which the creature can try again.
- The Second Trial Upon successfully passing the first trial, a single, sharp voice will speak directly to the wielder, asking them what the purpose of the Sworn Pactbreaker is. Only the correct answer - judged by the DM - will allow them to succeed the trial, though if the wielder is of evil alignment, there is no possibility of a correct response. An incorrect response will cause the wielder to be deemed unworthy, suffering the effects as above.
- The Third Trial The scythe speaks to the wielder again, giving them a mission to free a citizen from their bond with a lesser demon. The wielder must kill or banish the demon to pass the third trial; only then will they finally attune to the weapon and unlock its full potential.

Once attuned, the wielder of the Sworn Pactbreaker gains the following benefits:

Righteous Judgment. The Sworn Pactbreaker deals an additional 2d10 radiant damage on a hit. If the target is of evil alignment (lawful evil, neutral evil, or chaotic evil), it deals another 1d10 radiant damage on a hit.

Champion of the Pactbreaker. Your Strength and Dexterity scores each increase by 2 , to a maximum of 20 .

Sentience. The weapon is imbued with the consciousness of its previous wielders. The collective consciousness speaks to the current wielder, teaching and guiding their actions to make them truly worthy to hold the blade.

Destroying the Sworn Pactbreaker. Only a Demon Lord can truly destroy the Sworn Pactbreaker. This can be done by defeating its wielder in combat, then lighting it ablaze with hellfire.

## Armor Set of the Tyrant

Ages ago, a man called Cyprus the Divine ruled over a vast human kingdom. He possessed a great power that seemed to come from the divine, allowing him to very nearly match them in power. He was named the God King, and he was an unstoppable general, generous leader and a humble man. Countless races and factions banded together to attempt to overthrow Cyprus and obtain his overwhelming power for themselves, but every army that came was defeated before they could even reach him.

While he was seen as a god, he was still mortal and human. He eventually grew old, and the constant war made him paranoid. He foresaw the existence of Ascendants, people prophesied by the gods to succeed Cyprus in his rule. Fearing the loss of his power and return to mortality and death, he searched frantically for these Ascendants, claiming the gods decieved him and that they would destroy him and his kingdom. His methods grew increasingly brutal, including mass executions and razing of villages, killing every Ascendant he could get his hands on save for one - his son, Alexander, the man Cyprus saw fit to properly succeed him after his passing.

Alexander came of age some time after Cyprus's death, and sought to become the next to be called Divine, like his father. To accomplish this goal, he learned that an Ascendant had to "become one with all... to give up everything, and take everything." He tried, as did other Ascendants who survived Cyprus's wrath, and all have failed. What the old king failed to mention was that the key to manifesting his power lay in the armor that he had always worn. With its pieces scattered to the winds, Alexander began his new quest, leading an army of magisters on a hunt for his father's legendary suit of armor.

## Stride of the Tyrant

## Wondrous item, artifact

These black and silver armored boots carry the weight of a terrible power with each stride. While wearing these boots, your Constitution score increases by 2 , as does your maximum for that score.

Curse. When wearing these boots, you feel that your steps are being pulled in another direction. Your speed is reduced by half while wearing these boots. Additionally, during a short or long rest, roll a d100. On a roll of 90-99, you wake from your rest $1 \mathrm{~d} 10 \times 100$ feet away from where you made camp in a random direction. On a roll of 100 , you wake 1 mile from your camp in a random direction without making a sound.

## Eyes of the Tyrant

## Wondrous item, artifact

This black and silver helmet has a visor that shields your face. When you look through it, your eyes appear to have turned a fiery red. While wearing the helmet, your Strength score increases by 2 , as does your maximum for that score, and you gain resistance to fire damage.

Curse. While wearing this helmet, you feel your body temperature begin to rise. The heat is unnerving, but becomes natural the longer you wear the helmet, to the point that being without that heat physically harms you. You gain vulnerability to cold damage. If you remove the helmet, your cold vulnerability remains for 1d4 days.

## TracKS OF THE Tyrant

## Wondrous item, artifact

This set of silken garments is enchanted to remain perfectly clean and sizes perfectly to fit your body. Despite this, wearing it causes a shiver to run through your entire body. While wearing the helmet, your gain resistance to lightning damage and your speed increases by 10 feet.

Curse. Despite the lightness of the garment, it feels as if wearing it makes you feel like something is missing. You gain one level of exhaustion while wearing it. This level of exhaustion cannot be removed except if you possess two more pieces of the Tyrant's armor. A spell such as greater restoration can suppress this level of exhaustion for 4 hours.

## Heart of the Tyrant

## Armor (half plate), artifact

This black and silver armor fills you with immense heat and power as you don it, as every movement threatens to unleash it upon your foes. Your melee attacks deal 1d6 additional fire damage on a hit.

Curse. This fire is hard to control, and bursts painfully from your body without warning at the slightest disturbance. Whenever you are hit with an attack or spell, you take an additional 1d6 fire damage.

## Dukes of the Tyrant

## Wondrous item, artifact

These black and silver gauntlets fill you with an oddly comforting warmth, despite their harsh appearance. There is a small notch on the ring finger of one of the gauntlets, and the longer you stare at that spot, the more you feel that something is meant to fit there. While wearing these gloves, you lose vulnerability to cold damage and gain resistance to cold damage.

Curse. The warmth, though beneficial at times, seems to turn your stomach. You are permanently subjected to the poisoned condition. This condition cannot be removed except by obtaining the Ring of the Tyrant or by a wish spell.

## Ring of the Tyrant

## Ring, artifact

As you don this ring, you feel as if a terrible weight has been lifted. You stand up, filled with renewed vigor. You feel... that you could conquer the world. While wearing this ring, your Constitution score increases by 2 .

Curse. While you wear the ring, you find yourself unable and unwilling to take it off. It cannot be removed except by the wish spell. Additionally, you find yourself driven to find the other pieces of the Tyrant's armor, if you do not have them already. Finally completing the set fills you with the power and spirit of a long-deceased warlord who ruled entire realms. The curses from the other pieces of the Tyrant's armor no longer affect you, as long as you are wearing the entire set. However, if you lose a single piece of this armor, all of your ability scores are reduced to 10 until you reclaim the missing piece. Additionally, you gain the following flaw: "My armor is more valuable than my life. I must protect it at all costs."

## New Technology

## Steampunk Tools

The following is a list of new tools that a steampunk adventurer could choose to be proficient in. You can add these tools to the great tools already in the Player's Handbook like Smith's Tools and Tinker's Tools.

Proficiency with any of these artisan's tools lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks made using the tools of your craft. Each type of artisan's tools requires a separate proficiency. Each of these kits provide the tools needed to pursue a craft or trade.

| Artisan's Tools | Cost | Weight |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Chemist's supplies | 50 gp | 8 lbs |
| Doctor's tools | 50 gp | 8 lbs |

Steampunk Adventurer's Gear

| Item | Cost | Weight |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Compass | 100 gp | $1 / 4 \mathrm{lb}$. |
| Fuel | 20 gp per gallon | 6 lbs |
| Goggles | 1 gp | $1 / 2 \mathrm{lb}$. |
| Hat | 1 sp to 5 gp | $1 / 2 \mathrm{lb}$. to 2 lb . |
| Ink Pen | 1 gp | $1 / 8 \mathrm{lb}$. |
| Ink Cartridge | 5 sp | $1 / 16 \mathrm{lb}$. |
| Lighter | 8 gp | $1 / 2 \mathrm{lb}$. |
| Matchbox | 4 gp | 1 lb . |
| Parasol (Silk) | 5 gp | 4 lbs. |
| Pocket Watch | 5 gp to 20 gp | 2 lbs. |
| Photographic Camera | 50 gp | 4 lb . |

| Steamer Trunk (Large) | 5 gp | 20 lb . |
| Tool/Utility Belt | 2 gp | 2 lb . |
| Wristwatch | 5 gp | $1 / 2 \mathrm{lb}$. |

Compass. This is a tiny metal and glass compass with a magnetic pointer that always points north. All Wisdom (Survival) checks made to determine location and direction are made with advantage when using a compass.

Goggles. A pair of goggles can block out the soot and wind while traveling or protect the vision of the wearer from smoke, sparks and other hazards. They also help your character look the part.

Ink Pen. This pen does not require constant dipping of ink, as the ink is stored in lightweight cartridges in the body of the pen itself.

Lighter. A lighter holds a small amount of a flammable substance ignited by a flint striking metal. Its flame lights a 5foot area as a candle does but it burns for 3 hours. A single flask of oil can refill two lighters.

---

Match. An alchemical substance on the end of this small, wooden stick ignites when struck against a rough surface. Creating a flame with a match is much faster than creating a flame with flint and steel (or a magnifying glass) and tinder, although not as fast as with a lighter.

Photographic Camera. A handheld device with a protruding lens on the front. It is used to capture a static image of what is in the view of the lens onto a plate.

Photo Plate. A metal plate that holds a special paper used to capture what is exposed by the photographic camera lens. The captured image provides an accurate depiction of what opening the lens revealed, but without color. To develop a photo plate you must be proficient with alchemist's supplies.

Pocket Watch. A circular device stored in a metal case used to provide the exact time of day, linked to a chain that is stored in a waist pocket of a jacket or vest.

Smokestick. A wooden stick that is chemically treated to instantly create thick, opaque smoke when ignited. It emits a cloud of smoke in a 10 -foot radius. The stick burns and releases smoke for a full round, and the smoke disperses after another round.

Tool/Utility Belt. A sturdy belt made from leather with numerous covered pockets to hold small tools and supplies, making it easy to keep about 10 pounds of items on hand.

Wristwatch. A device worn on the wrist used to provide the exact time of day.

## Unique Items/ Gear

They say that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. These items are unique enough in this highly technological age that they might as well be magic. Many of these unique are highly mechanical and have a lot of moving/working parts requiring delicate maintenance.

These items and weapons are complex and unfamiliar, requiring special training to use - which is indicated by proficiency with exotic weapons, items, and armor.

## 3-Dimensional Maneuver Gear

Exotic weapon, light armor
Weight total: 10 lbs ( 50 lbs on a full tank)
Cost: $10,000 \mathrm{gp}$
This device allows players to grapple on to walls and hard surfaces within range. It is controlled using a specially built weapon that triggers a gas release mechanism. The item includes three pieces: the gas release, grappling hooks, and weapon control.

Grappling hook. The gas-powered hook launcher and rope is the defining feature of this device. The crossbow-bolt-like hook is attached to a cable made of tough, high-tension cables that are 200 feet long. Six rope-and-grapple assemblies are stored in the device, ready to be deployed. The grapples and ropes contribute 10 pounds to the weight of the maneuver gear.

Deploying the hook requires either your full movement or your action. Choose a point on a wall or surface within range; if its hardness is less than 10, the hook embeds itself completely into the material, anchoring itself to that spot.

In a precarious situation, the hook launchers themselves can be used as a weapon; however, due to their size and design, an attack made using the launchers is made at disadvantage and only deals 1d4 piercing damage on a hit.

Gas release. The gas release is a small fan and high-speed pulley in the back, attached to the ropes and used to either reel in or release them at will for the sake of maneuverability. If you have already deployed the grappling hook, as part of your attack action, you can trigger the gas release to move up to 60 feet along the length of the cable towards the end of your hook.

The gas used for propulsion is held in canisters attached to the release. A canister holds 40 pounds of fuel when full; each time this ability is triggered, it consumes 1 pound.

The gas release nozzle can also be utilized to increase speed and maneuverability. Once per round, if you're not moving using the maneuver gear, you can expend 0.5 pounds of fuel to move 10 feet in the direction you are facing.

Reloading an empty gas canister takes a full hour. Reloading the mechanism with a new gas canister takes 2 rounds.
![img-16.jpeg](assets/The%20Homebrewery%20Steampunk_img-16.jpeg)

---

Weapon control. The weapon you control the gear with must be specially fitted to the gear itself. When you obtain the gear, choose one of the following weapons: light mace, longsword, rapier, shortsword, scimitar, or sickle. You can also choose a shield this way, following the rules for using it as an improvised weapon if you attack with it.
![img-17.jpeg](assets/The%20Homebrewery%20Steampunk_img-17.jpeg)

As part of the construction of the maneuver gear, the chosen weapon is attached to it with an array of light cables. You use controls on the weapon to activate the hooks and gas release, which allows you to attack and maneuver using the gear simultaneously. You can be disarmed, but picking the weapon up only requires a bonus action and does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

Control during cabled flight. While maneuvering using the gear, as part of your movement, you can shift your body weight, displacing yourself in any direction up to 10 feet. This shift of weight requires a successful DC 16 Acrobatics check. The DC of this check is reduced by 2 if you are using two maneuver gears in conjunction. Your destination remains the same.

Releasing the cables prior to landing. You can disengage the grappling hook before you land as a bonus action. If you do this in midair, you are now in free fall and have little control over your landing location. You will still keep your momentum, flying in the same direction as before unless you succeed a DC 20 Acrobatics check to displace yourself 5 feet. After this movement, you fall (and take damage) as normal.

Landing horizontally. If you are traveling horizontally when you reach the hook's destination, you must make a DC 16 Athletics check, taking 3d6 bludgeoning damage per 50 feet traveled.
![img-18.jpeg](assets/The%20Homebrewery%20Steampunk_img-18.jpeg)

Jet PaGK
Exotic Item, light armor
Weight total: 15 pounds ( 20 pounds on a full tank) Cost: $15,000 \mathrm{gp}$

The jet pack allows players to move in three dimensions at high speeds. Unlike the 3-Dimensional Maneuver Gear, it requires no support, meaning that the player doesn't need to have ground or structures near them to fly with full maneuverability.
Jet Propulsion. A pair of exhaust vents are located on the bottom of the jet pack. The high-speed gouts of superheated air that come out of them are the primary force used in the generation of lift, giving the wearer a flying speed of up to 40 feet, with complete maneuverability.

Fuel Supply. The jetpack has a high-speed intake fan along its top edge that takes in air to help ignite the fuel to generate large amounts of power. This ignition requires a special kind of fuel, which is held in a single tank fuel cell.

Fuel for the jetpack comes in a solid form that costs 50 gp per pound, and the jetpack's fuel cell holds 5 pounds of fuel at a time.

Every 100 feet of movement using the jet pack consumes one pound of fuel. In an emergency case where you run out of fuel while in the air, there is a secondary thruster and backup fuel source that allows an additional 50 feet of movement and helps slow your descent.

Landing. Landing safely requires a DC 16 Dexterity (Athletics) check if you are traveling more then 10 feet vertically at an altitude of over 10 feet. On a failed check, you take 3d6 bludgeoning damage per 50 feet traveled. If you fall, you take damage as normal.

# POWER ARMOR 

Exotic Item, Heavy armor
Weight total: 250 pounds
Cost: $150,000 \mathrm{gp}$
As long as you are wearing the armor, you gain the following benefits:

Ability Score Increase. Your Strength score increases by 6 , to a maximum of 25 , and your Constitution score increases by 4 , to a maximum of 20 . However, your Dexterity score decreases by 4 , and your speed is reduced by 10 feet.

Elemental Resistance. You have resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. Additionally, when you obtain this armor, choose one damage type from acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, or thunder. You have resistance to the chosen damage type.

Rebreather. For an additional 5,000 gp when you purchase this armor, it can be equipped with an oxygen rebreather. You can activate the rebreather to gain resistance to cold damage in high altitudes, as well breathe normally underwater or in the presence of poisonous gases. The rebreather functions for 1 hour, after which point it must be recharged (which can be done during a short or long rest).

Battery Life. The power armor runs on a protected enchanted crystal that fits into a specialized slot in the back of the armor. This crystal's magic lasts for a total of 24 hours of continued use before it shatters and the armor is rendered immobile. The armor gives off a series of faint pulses when the crystal's magic is reduced to only 4 hours remaining.

A replacement crystal can be purchased for $2,200 \mathrm{gp}$. Alternatively, if you are a spellcaster, you can use your action to expend one 3rd-level spell slot, two 2nd-level slots, or three 1st-level slots to instantly recharge the battery to full capacity.

Weapon Arsenal. The power armor is equipped with your choice of 2 two-handed weapons or 2 one-handed weapons and a two-handed weapon. These weapons are attached to the armor's back and can be drawn or stowed as part of your movement. Choose from the following:

## Melee Weapons

- Greatclub
- Mace
- Spear
- Glaive
- Greataxe
- Greatsword
- Halberd (Does not require mount)

## Prosthetics

The adventurer's life is not an easy one, and odds are that sooner or later, someone is going to be missing something.

There are many ways in which a character can lose a limb (such as an attack from a sword of sharpness) but not all are described in detail. It is mentioned that someone who is turned to stone, damaged, and then turned back to flesh suffers the same "deformities" that were suffered while petrified. Presumably this would mean a missing arm or leg. Others are more vague, but the description of the regenerate spell clearly states that it regenerates lost limbs, indicating that such a thing can happen.

Additionally, some third party material spells out the possibility of loss of limbs - usually products that detail critical hits and fumbles.

While magical healing is an amazing thing, the truth is that most parties aren't going to have a healer of sufficiently advanced level to cast regenerate to reattach that missing limb. At lower levels, the amount of money required for such healing may be unattainable. In short, there are going to be times when someone's going to need an artificial replacement for their own flesh and blood, at least in the short term.

There are several different levels and types of replacements for a missing limb, from the incredibly basic, such as hook hands and peg legs, to mechanical and magical replacements that are nearly as capable as the genuine article.

## Armor for Prosthetics

Armored prosthetics are easily achieved by adding armorgrade leather or steel to a prosthetic. A character with funds to spend can choose to add mithril or adamantine armor to a prosthetic. Typically, only full-length prosthetic arms or legs are armored. Rather than granting an armor class bonus (as armor worn by a character would), armor for prosthetics instead increases the hit points of the prosthetic, making it less vulnerable to damage from an enemy's blade.

## Loss of Limb

The discussion of prosthetics requires a discussion on the penalties a character would suffer as the result of losing a limb. The Injuries variant rule (found in the Dungeon Master's Guide) denotes the following:

Losing an Arm or a Hand. You can no longer hold anything with two hands, and you can hold only a single object at a time. Magic such as the regenerate spell can restore the lost appendage.

Losing a Foot or Leg. Your speed on foot is halved, and you must use a cane or crutch to move unless you have a peg leg or other prosthesis. You fall prone after using the Dash action. You have disadvantage on Dexterity checks made to balance. Magic such as the regenerate spell can restore the lost appendage.

Limp. Your speed on foot is reduced by 5 feet. You must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw after using the Dash action. If you fail the save, you fall prone. Magical healing removes the limp.

## Types of Prosthetics

There are 4 main types of prosthetics, differing from the quality of the materials, the craftsmanship and functionality: Basic, Intermediate, Mechanical and Magical. There are also 2 sub-types, which are add-ons to prosthetics, which are combat and cosmetic.

Combat add-ons are pieces of tech that replace parts, or add combat centered mechanics and functions such as blades, ranged weapons, etc.

Cosmetic add-ons are just pieces that are added to one's prosthetics to change its appearance, either making it more natural looking, disguising it, or by making it more menacing looking.

Basic prosthetics. Cheap, bare-boned (no pun intended), semi-functional replacements. From hooks to peg legs to crutches. They are simple, easy to make and very cheap.

Cosmetic prosthetics. A Basic or better prosthetic can be crafted in a way as to disguise the fact that it is there at all, though the tradeoff between appearance and usefulness is very steep.

Intermediate prosthetics. More intricate and adequate replacements for limbs, giving the owner more freedom of movement, allowing them to move and perform basic tasks without many issues. They also come with placements for attachments. They cost more than the basic prosthetics, but they give the use most their previous functions back.

Mechanical prosthetics. By using clockwork mechanisms, powered by the owner's body, this type of prosthetic gives the user his or her lost functionality back, and more besides, from weapons or mechanisms that enhance one's strength, resilience or mobility. The only lingering regret after getting a prosthetic such as this would be the lack of sensation in the missing limb, be it pain or simple touch.

These are some of the more expensive kinds of prosthetics, but also one of the most customizable and well made. It is rather difficult to find places with engineers and craftsmen good enough to create these kinds of prosthetics, unless in a capital or a university of sorts that focuses on this sort of engineering.

Combat prosthetics. An Intermediate or Mechanical prosthetic can be specially crafted to serve as a weapon, sacrificing appearance and function for lethality.

Magical prosthetics. These are very special and rare. They usually aren't sold off-the-rack, and are typically specially crafted for their user. These sort of prosthetics are enchanted and made from special magical materials that give the user additional abilities - additionally, they might also give a user all the functions of a normal functioning limb, including the feeling of touch and pain.

The bespoke nature of these type of prosthetics, including their research, development, and enchantment, drives the cost well beyond the means of most people.

# Basic 

## Prosthetics

Blunt Fist $\quad 50 \mathrm{gp} \quad$ A blunt fist is a solid ball of metal, or sometimes it is shaped like a fist or hammerhead. It is typically little more than a tool, as its construction is ill-suited for combat.
Blunt Foot $\quad 50 \mathrm{gp} \quad$ A solid wooden sphere with the base shaved flat, the blunt foot increases its wearer's walking speed by 10 feet (though it is still reduced by half before this increase). The wearer's speed cannot be increased beyond this limit, either by abilities, feats, or magic. Additionally, the wearer can make a DC 15 Dexterity check to avoid falling prone after taking the Dash action.
Crow's Foot $\quad 60 \mathrm{gp} \quad$ Y-shaped with built in stump grip, the wooden crow's foot returns the feel of a normal foot to the wearer, allowing Strength (Athletics) checks that would normally be made with disadvantage due to the missing foot to be made with a -2 penalty instead. In all other ways it is identical to the blunt foot.
Crutch $\quad 5 \mathrm{gp} \quad$ A Y- or T-shaped implement of wood used to help support one's weight when one's leg cannot. A character's speed is reduced by 5 feet while using a crutch. The crutch can be used as a club, but attacks with it are made with disadvantage unless the wearer is proficient with improvised weapons.
Gaff Hand $\quad 25 \mathrm{gp} \quad$ A simple metal gaff hook, like those used by sailors and longshoremen, mounted on a harness that fits over the character's stump. It is only capable of the crudest manipulation and does not have a grip. It is impossible to hold a tool or weapon with this hand, but it can be used for opening doors or loosely holding onto things. It is otherwise similar to a sculpted hand. A character wearing a gaff hand gets advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks so long as the hand is used as part of the intimidation.

## Cosmetic Prosthetics

Sculpted Foot $\quad 80 \mathrm{gp} \quad$ This prosthetic is a wooden or stone foot which resembles a real foot. Sculpted feet are often /Sculpted Leg painted in flesh tones to match the skin of the character wearing them and can only be identified as a prosthetic with a successful DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check. If the character is wearing socks, shoes or boots, no one can identify the prosthetic. The sculpted foot or leg is not at all fully functional. It is otherwise similar to a blunt foot.
Sculpted Hand $\quad 80 \mathrm{gp} \quad$ This prosthetic is a wooden or ceramic hand, usually in a generally relaxed pose, which looks real at /Sculpted Arm first glance. Sculpted hands are often painted in flesh tones to match the skin of the character wearing it and can only be identified as a prosthetic with a successful DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check. It can hold mundane objects weighing 10 pounds or less, such as cups and pouches, between its opened fingers, but cannot be used to wield weapons. Any Strength or Dexterity checks made that involve the prosthetic are made with disadvantage.
Ornate Arm $\quad 400 \mathrm{gp}$ An expertly crafted arm that is covered in finely curved goldenrods that engulf it with porcelain covering the base prosthetic. You can show off its fine craftsmanship to another person to gain advantage on a single Charisma check against that person. However, due to the nature of the prosthetic, any Strength or Dexterity checks made that involve the prosthetic are made with disadvantage.
Ornate Foot $\quad 350 \mathrm{gp}$ This is a porcelain foot covered in gold rodding. You can use it to gain advantage on a single Charisma check as with the Ornate Arm, but your movement speed is reduced by 10 feet (to a minimum of 10 feet) on difficult terrain.
Ornate Leg $\quad 500 \mathrm{gp}$ This elaborate prosthetic functions like the Ornate Foot.
Ornate Hand $\quad 300 \mathrm{gp}$ This prosthetic is a replacement hand, but otherwise functions like the Ornate Arm.

| Type | Cost | Description |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Intermediate Prosthetics |  |  |
| Hinged Calf | 75 gp | This tight jointed prosthetic is made of leather and metal, and mimics the knee-to-ankle area of the leg. Ankle/foot prosthetics can be attached to its ankle end. The hinged calf improves mobility to the point that your speed is no longer halved, though you now walk with a limp (see the Loss of Limb sidebar above). |
| Hinged Forearm | 75 gp | This tight jointed prosthetic mimics the elbow-to-wrist area of the arm. Wrist/hand prosthetics can be attached to its end. The hinged forearm is made of leather and metal. Strength and Dexterity checks involving the prosthetic are made normally, though with a -2 penalty. |
| Pocket Shaft | 120 gp | A pocket shaft gives every impression of being nothing more than a hinged forearm without a wrist attachment. However, a pocket shaft actually contains a hidden repository. The pocket can hold as much as a belt pouch, and is padded to muffle the sound of items moving inside. Discovering the existence of the pocket shaft requires a DC 25 Wisdom (Perception) check. In all other ways it is identical to a hinged forearm. |
| Shin Sheath | 120 gp | The distance between the knee and the ankle is exactly the same length as the average dagger. Resembling a hinged calf, the shin sheath is the dream of any rogue who has lost a leg. Finding a dagger hidden in a shin sheath requires a DC 25 Wisdom (Perception) check. In all other ways it is identical to a hinged calf. |
| Talon | 65 gp | A modified fork or hook, with three metal digits that can open and close, allowing them to hold objects somewhat well. The claws are manipulated by using the muscles of the upper arm and turning the remnants of the limb. Some look like a set of simple metal hooks capable of pivoting, while others are more ornate, shaped to resemble the talons of predatory birds. The talon hand can be used as a weapon, delivering 1 d 6 points of slashing damage. It is treated as a light simple weapon. It is otherwise identical to a gaff hand. |
| Wooden Leg | 95 gp | A simplified and not very life-like wooden leg which has a hinged knee and jointed ankle. The wooden leg allows the character to walk stiffly. It is otherwise similar to a hinged calf. |
| Mechanical Prosthetics |  |  |
| Boneless Leg | $1,200 \mathrm{gp}$ | This prosthetic is made of high-impact, lightweight materials, allowing for greater freedom of movement. Your do not suffer penalties to your speed with this prosthetic, and your movement speed increases by an additional 5 feet. However, a well-placed attack could break the prosthetic, as the material is more brittle than that of regular prosthetics. |
| Clamp | 65 gp | A spring-loaded, metal, crab-like claw originally designed by gnomes to improve their grip. The clamp can hold items like a normal hand, though it cannot be used to wield a two-handed weapon. Strength and Dexterity checks involving the prosthetic that would normally have disadvantage are instead made normally with a -2 penalty. Additionally, the clamp can be used as an improvised club, which the wearer is proficient with. |
| Clockwork <br> Arm | 500 gp | The clockwork arm appears to be a normal arm sleeved in plate armor, but when one listens closely the sound of gears whirring and clicking can be heard whenever the arm moves. First perfected by gnomes, clockwork arms are now built by several master smiths. The clockwork arm provides a nearperfect semblance of full functionality, but is quite expensive. Wearing a clockwork arm negates the penalties from the wearer's missing limb and further grants a character a +2 bonus to Strength when determining lifting/carrying capacity, as well as for attacks and damage rolls for weapons wielded by the clockwork arm (the bonus does not apply to weapons wielded by the other arm, except for twohanded weapons), as well as for grappling. |
| Clockwork Leg | 800 gp | Similar to the clockwork arm, the clockwork leg appears to be an armored leg that clicks and whirs as it moves. The clockwork leg was another gnomish invention. The leg provides a near-perfect return to full functionality and mobility for the wearer, but is very expensive. The clockwork leg negates the wearer's penalties for losing a leg at the knee. |
| Haft Lock | 150 gp | A vice that provides a great deal of grip, but unlike the clamp, the haft lock must be adjusted manually to achieve the proper tension. As a prosthetic, it allows the wearer to wield a weapon twohanded. Adjusting a haft lock takes an action. It is otherwise identical to the clamp. |
| Iron Arm | 2,500 gp | A very strong prosthetic and durable prosthetic made entirely of metal. It is hollow on the inside but its weight still the wearer to have a minimum Strength score of 14 . While wearing this you get a +1 bonus to $A C$, but when in water deeper than your height you sink to the bottom and can't swim. |
| Rabbit's Foot | 2,000 gp | This lightweight, durable leg prosthetic increases your the height of your high jump to a minimum of twice your current height. |

| Combat <br> Prosthetics |  |  |
| Hook Hand | 25 gp | This basic prosthetic deals 1d4 piercing damage when used in combat, and is considered a light simple weapon. |
| Bladed Arm | 2,000 gp | The spring-loaded blade on this prosthetic is treated as a one-handed weapon with the light and finesse properties. It deals 1d8 slashing damage on a hit. While armed with this it can be put away and hidden slightly but not fully. |
| Bladed Leg | 3,000 gp | The calf and foot of the missing leg is replaced with a heavy, yet sharp blade that you walk upon. You can make an off-hand attack with a bladed leg even if you are carrying an item in each hand. It deals 1 d 8 slashing damage and is considered a light martial weapon, but if you don't have martial weapon training it is considered an improvised weapon. |
| Crossbow Arm | 1,100 gp | The crossbow arm is a light crossbow designed to be loaded and fired with one hand. The crossbow folds into the main body of the prosthetic when at rest. Bolts fired from the crossbow arm deal 1d6 piercing damage. |
| Dart Launcher | 900 gp | The dart launcher is an arm prosthetic that fires standard darts (1d4 piercing; finesse, thrown $(20 / 60))$. This is considered a light simple weapon. |
| Spiked Limb | 750 gp | The spiked limb is a solid piece of oak covered in metal spikes. An ever-present weapon, it deals 1d6 bludgeoning and piercing damage on a successful strike, and is treated as a light simple weapon. It is otherwise identical to a blunt hand. |

## Magical

## Prosthetics

| Brute's <br> Arm | 1,200 gp | When equipped with this enchanted limb your Strength score increases by 2, as does your maximum for that score. Additionally, your carrying capacity triples, as does the weight you can push, drag, or lift. It otherwise functions as a normal arm. |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Dexterous Leg | 1,100 gp | A leg prosthetic that increases your Dexterity score and its corresponding maximum by 2 and increases your movement speed by 10 feet, it otherwise functions as a normal leg.. |
| Energy <br> Palm, Cold | N/A | A glowing blue evocation rune is scribed onto the palm. While wearing this prosthetic, a nonmagical melee weapon wielded with that hand deals an additional 1d4 cold damage on a hit. You also learn the frostbite cantrip (save DC 13). |
| Energy <br> Palm, <br> Electricity | N/A | The glowing yellow rune scribed on the palm allows this prosthetic to function as Energy Palm, Cold, though the additional damage is lightning instead of cold, and you learn the shocking grasp cantrip. You cast this cantrip with an attack bonus of +5 . |
| Energy <br> Palm, Fire | N/A | The glowing red and orange rune scribed on the palm allows this prosthetic to function as Energy Palm, Cold, though the additional damage is fire instead of cold, and you learn the produce flame cantrip. If you attack with the flame from this cantrip, you do so with an attack bonus of +5 . |
| Morphic <br> Arm | N/A | This black, almost oily-looking prosthetic shifts and morphs at its wearer's will, allowing it to take the form of any one-handed melee weapon or simple tool the wearer is proficient with. Changing the form of the morphic arm takes one action. |
| Wizard's Hand | 3,000 gp | Being made of a special and rare material, it is a prosthetic for magic users that lost a limb. When worn by a magic user, it serves as as their spellcasting focus. Additionally, it is a magic weapon that can be used to make a melee spell attack, dealing 1d8 bludgeoning damage on a hit. |

# MADNESS 

This is the Madness Variant Rule found in the Dungeon Master's Guide (p. 258).

In a typical campaign, characters aren't driven mad by the horrors they face and the carnage they inflict day after day, but sometimes the stress of being an adventurer can be too much to bear. If your campaign has a strong horror theme, you might want to use madness as a way to reinforce that theme, emphasizing the extraordinarily horrific nature of the threats the adventurers face.

## Going Mad

Various magical effects can inflict madness on an otherwise stable mind. Certain spells, such as contact other plane and symbol, can cause insanity, and you can use the madness rules here instead of the spell effects of those spells.
Diseases, poisons, and planar effects such as psychic wind or the howling winds of Pandemonium can all inflict madness. Some artifacts can also break the psyche of a character who uses or becomes attuned to them.

Resisting a madness-inducing effect usually requires a Wisdom or Charisma saving throw.

## Madness Effects

Madness can be short-term, long-term, or indefinite. Most relatively mundane effects impose short-term madness, which lasts for just a few minutes. More horrific effects or cumulative effects can result in long-term or indefinite madness. A character afflicted with short-term madness is subjected to an effect from the Short-Term Madness table for 1 d 10 minutes.

A character afflicted with long-term madness is subjected to an effect from the Long-Term Madness table for $1 \mathrm{~d} 10 \times 10$ hours.

A character afflicted with indefinite madness gains a new character flaw from the Indefinite Madness table that lasts until cured.

## Short-Term Madness

d100 Effect (lasts 1d10 minutes)
01-20 The character retreats into his or her mind and becomes paralyzed. The effect ends if the character takes any damage.
21-30 The character becomes incapacitated and spends the duration screaming, laughing, or weeping.
31-40 The character becomes frightened and must use his or her action and movement each round to flee from the source of the fear.
41-50 The character begins babbling and is incapable of normal speech or spellcasting.
51-60 The character must use his or her action each round to attack the nearest creature.
61-70 The character experiences vivid hallucinations and has disadvantage on ability checks.
71-75 The character does whatever anyone tells him or her to do that isn't obviously self-destructive.
75-80 The character experiences an overpowering urge to eat something strange such as dirt, slime, or offal.
81-90 The character is stunned.
91-100 The character falls unconscious.

---

## Long-Term Madness

d100 Effect (lasts $1 d 10 \times 10$ hours)
01-10 The character feels compelled to repeat a specific activity over and over, such as washing hands, touching things, praying, or counting coins.
11-20 The character experiences vivid hallucinations and has disadvantage on ability checks.
21-30 The character suffers extreme paranoia. The character has disadvantage on Wisdom and Charisma checks.
31-40 The character regards something (usually the source of madness) with intense revulsion, as if affected by the antipathy effect of the antipathy/sympathy spell.
41-45 The character experiences a powerful delusion. Choose a potion. The character imagines that he or she is under its effects.
46-55 The character becomes attached to a "lucky charm," such as a person or an object, and has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws while more than 30 feet from it.
56-65 The character is blinded (25\%) or deafened $(75 \%)$.
66-75 The character experiences uncontrollable tremors or tics, which impose disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws that involve Strength or Dexterity.
76-85 The character suffers from partial amnesia. The character knows who he or she is and retains racial traits and class features, but doesn't recognize other people or remember anything that happened before the madness took effect.
86-90 Whenever the character takes damage, he or she must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be affected as though he or she failed a saving throw against the confusion spell. The confusion effect lasts for 1 minute.
91-95 The character loses the ability to speak.
96-100 The character falls unconscious. No amount of jostling or damage can wake the character.

## Indefinite Madness

d100 Flaws (last until cured)
01-15 "Being drunk keeps me sane."
16-25 "I keep whatever I find."
26-30 "I try to become more like someone else I know--adopting his or her style of dress, mannerisms, and name."
31-35 "I must bend the truth, exaggerate, or outright lie to be interesting to other people."
36-45 "Achieving my goal is the only thing of interest to me, and I'll ignore everything else to pursue it."
46-50 "I find it hard to care about anything that goes on around me."
51-55 "I don't like the way people judge me all the time."
56-70 "I am the smartest, wisest, strongest, fastest, and most beautiful person I know."
71-80 "I am convinced that powerful enemies are hunting me, and their agents are everywhere I go. I am sure they're watching me all the time."
81-85 "There's only one person I can trust. And only I can see this special friend."
86-95 "I can't take anything seriously. The more serious the situation, the funnier I find it."
96-100 "I've discovered that I really like killing people."

## Curing Madness

A calm emotions spell can suppress the effects of madness, while a lesser restoration spell can rid a character of a shortterm or long-term madness. Depending on the source of the madness, remove curse or dispel evil might also prove effective. A greater restoration spell or more powerful magic is required to rid a character of indefinite madness.

## Mounts and Vehicles

Over the past centuries of technological improvements, advancements have been made to mounted and vehicular travel. Vehicles such as the bicycle and hot air balloon are joined by cars, motorcycles, and airships - though some still prefer the traditional horse and buggy, either out of stubbornness or fear. Even with these new options available, one thing remains unchanged in travel: you still have to treat your "mount" right.

## Travel Speed and Page

Speeds of vehicles below are provided in feet per round, similar to movement speed on foot. Multiplying this speed by ten will give an equivalent speed in feet per minute. And, for the sake of convenience, dividing this speed by 10 will give a rough estimate of speed in miles per hour (mph) - which can then be used to determine how many miles the vehicle travels in a day.

Speed can be doubled to begin traveling at a fast pace, or halved to travel at a slow pace. Traveling at a fast pace incurs a -5 penalty on passive Wisdom (Perception) scores, causes active Wisdom (Perception) checks to be made at disadvantage, and has the potential to cause damage to your vehicle beyond normal wear and tear. Traveling at a slow pace, by contrast, allows the possibility of stealth, though significantly impacts your resource consumption, as getting to your destination takes twice as long.

## Wind Speed

Some vehicles move through the air as easily as others do on land or water. These vehicles rely partially on the speed of the wind to determine their rate of travel. The DM can roll 2d10 to determine the current wind speed (in feet per round), and then roll a d 8 to determine the direction:

| d 8 | Direction |
| :-- | :-- |
| 1 | North |
| 2 | Northeast |
| 3 | East |
| 4 | Southeast |
| 5 | South |
| 6 | Southwest |
| 7 | West |
| 8 | Northwest |

An air vehicle is moving with the wind as long as its direction of travel is either the same or one step away from the wind's direction (i.e. a vehicle traveling north is moving with the wind if the wind is moving north, northeast, or northwest). It is moving against the wind if it is more than two steps away from the wind's direction.

An air vehicle moving against the wind has its travel speed reduced by the wind speed, to a minimum of half of its normal speed. Similarly, an air vehicle moving with the wind will have its speed increased, to a maximum of 1.5 times its normal speed.

| Item | Cost | Speed | Capacity |
| Caravan | 100 gp | 30 ft. | 500 lbs., including |
|  |  |  | passengers |
| Carriage | 100 gp | 30 ft | 4 passengers |
| Cart | 15 gp | 40 ft | 300 lbs. |
| Monowheel | $1,000 \mathrm{gp}$ | 60 ft | 1 passenger |
| Small Car | 750 gp | 100 ft | 4 passengers, |
|  |  |  | or 2 with cargo |
| Large Car | $2,000 \mathrm{gp}$ | 200 ft | 8 passengers, |
|  |  |  | or 6 with cargo |
| Clockwork | $100,000 \mathrm{gp}$ | 50 ft | 6 crewmen |
| Tank |  |  |  |
| Steam Tank | $7,200 \mathrm{gp}$ | 30 ft | 8 crewmen |
| Steam Engine | $10,000 \mathrm{gp}$ | 180 ft | 300 passengers |

Caravans, Carriages, and Carts. These simple vehicles are pulled by draft horses (or similar animals). A caravan is designed largely for holding a large amount of cargo, while a carriage is designed to comfortably house a number of passengers.

Cars and Tanks. These modern vehicles are fitted with engines consisting of heavy boilers and condensers. The power of the vehicle is intrinsically tied to the size of the boiler. A larger boiler is heavier, but produces more power.

The machinery of a steam-powered car is intricate and prone to damage at higher speeds, and the wheels and axles are not tuned for 'off-roading'. Cars travel at half speed when not traveling on an appropriate surface (i.e. pavement or tightpacked earth). Tanks do not suffer this penalty, as they run either on treads or on spiderlike clockwork legs and are better able to overcome difficult terrain.

Monowheel. This is a one-wheeled single-track vehicle similar to a unicycle. However, instead of sitting above the wheel as in a unicycle, the rider sits within it. Steering is accomplished by leaning within the moving vehicle, though this is difficult to do at speed or on difficult terrain.

Steam Engine. This vehicle is a train that runs on a very powerful steam engine, designed for passengers and their cargo. The size of its engine allows for a much higher theoretical speed, but since it runs on specially built rails, its speed is contingent on the quality of the wood and metal construction of these rails.

| Zephyr | $50,000 \mathrm{gp}$ | 40 ft (flying) | $10 \times 70 \mathrm{ft}$ |  | 500 lbs |

Cargo Ship. These bulky vessels are designed for the transit of large amount of heavy cargo, typically for commercial purposes. They have a large rear hatch that folds down into a broad ramp, and typically carry enough equipment - rope, pulleys, carts and dollies - to ease the loading and unloading of the ship. Though they are slow moving, they are designed to protect the cargo they are transporting.
Carrier Ship. Essentially "longer longboats", carrier ships are designed with a long flat area and covered shelters positioned abovedeck. This design provides a long runway for the launching of the many flying mounts that are stored in the shelters, as well as a mobile supply station for airborne troops.
Explorer's Ship. These light, maneuverable ships are designed to accommodate a small crew for both short scouting ventures and long away missions exploring uncharted areas. Their cabins are designed to accommodate multiple possible uses.
Feathered Galley: This sleek galley features sails made of feathers. The figurehead depicts a beautiful harpy flying above the jaws of a snapping sea drake.
Longboat. Ships designed exclusively for carrying men quickly. Often little more than just platforms and sails, these ships may not even use a balloon and may use sails angled to provide lift. These ships are only lightly armed, but are fast and maneuverable.

Merchant Ship. Designed for transit of moderate, easily accessible loads, these ships often double as a traveling storefront. Ships such as these can act as traveling restaurants if equipped with a well stocked galley. They have a collapsible ladder and boarding plank to be used to conduct business while in the air. These ships are not especially fast or maneuverable, but offer a smooth, comfortable ride, and are armed for self-defense.
Personal Vessel. A smaller ship, designed to be easily controlled and sailed by a small number of operators. These ships are simple and unarmed, and do not hold much personnel or cargo. This category of ships includes fishing boats and small caravels.
Skyboard. This is a flat longboard with a sail attached. It hovers in the air using special enchantments and is pushed either using wind power or boosters, depending on the model. The skyboard comes in many different styles, and is target towards younger audiences seeking aerial stunts and acrobatics.
Warship. These airships are designed to be the pinnacle of aerial combat. They are fast, maneuverable, and well armed. Large fleets of warships are typically owned by governments, but lone ships can typically be found sailed by pirates, merchants and adventurers.

---

Sky Yacht. Luxury vessels designed for the rich. These ships are for comfortable, luxurious travel and not much else. These ships prioritize comfort over any kind of defensive capability, but are typically fast enough to make a getaway at the sign of trouble.

Zeppelin. These airships are blimps built for cruising and luxury. They are crewed by around 15 aeronauts and boast comfortable seating and scenic views.

Zeppelin, War. This massive rigid skinned blimp is built for combat up to 3000 feet in the air. The gas bags are divided into multiple compartments so that a single puncture will not deflate an entire balloon. The war zeppelin is commonly crewed by 18 aeronauts (captain, commissar, chief engineer, cook, signals officer, navigator, and 12 noncommissioned crew). In addition to its weapon armament, it often is crewed with an additional 16 armed soldiers equipped with gliders or jetpacks.

Aerial Screw. Built of soarwood and canvas, this flying marvel has a rapidly turning rotor that keeps it airborne. There are no blades but rather a large, fairly flat apparatus of spiraling sail that thrusts air downward to generate lift.

Alchemical Dragon. This ship is made of wood and is usually crafted in the shape of a dragon. It is held aloft purely by its alchemical engine, a complicated and dangerous device that has a tendency to explode when the vehicle becomes wrecked. If an alchemical dragon crashes, the DM can choose make a DC 24 Constitution check using the Constitution modifier of the pilot. If the check fails, the alchemical engine explodes, dealing 10 d 10 points of fire damage to all objects and creatures within a 60 -foot radius of the alchemical engine. A creature can make a DC 17 Dexterity save to try to halve this damage.

Glider. A glider is basically a large piece of sail stretched out with a frame and connected to a handhold and straps. The only way to get a glider flying is to jump off a steep incline, allowing the glider to pick up the air current. Gliders have no power of their own, and must rely on these currents to remain aloft. When moving with the wind, a glider loses 5 feet of altitude for every 40 feet of movement. Against the wind, the glider loses 5 feet of altitude for every 10 feet of movement. In either case, gliders cannot ascend on their own.

Ornithopter. These devices are typically powered by intricate clockwork mechanisms that simulate the flapping of a bird's wings. Powered by one man (with some rudimentary enchantments, of course), these devices compete with skyboards for domination of the recreational flight market.

Zephyr. A massive balloon containing a bound air elemental is connected by chains to the ship below. This ship is similar to a sailing ship, complete with an open top, and is propelled by commanding or persuading the elemental to move.

## Propulsion Methods

- Arcane Engine. A unique blend of science and magic created this powerful engine. Arcane engines do not produce heat in the same way alchemical or steam engines do, and their fewer moving parts lead to fewer breakdowns, but maintenance requires the constant attention of powerful spellcasters, and a midair collision between two vehicles running arcane engines is far more disastrous.
- Alchemical Engine. Powerful but high on fuel consumption, these engines burn a very precise blend of chemicals to generate power. The fuel must be created by skilled crafters knowledgeable in the alchemical arts. Its production requires a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Alchemist's tools) check. On a failed check, the fuel is either completely nonvolatile or could cause the ship's engines to fail or even explode catastrophically.
- Steam Engine. The most basic of all the engines, this engine is the namesake of the current age. It is powered by two things - water and heat. Regardless of configuration, steam engines consist of a large boiler filled with water, hundreds of pounds of coal to bring the water to temperature, and a condenser to minimize the loss of energy to the open air. Steampowered vehicles typically require a full crew to power and steer, and their construction has many points of failure requiring skilled technicians to repair.
- Solar Sails. These sails are made using powerful enchantments and are much more expensive than your average canvas, costing up to 5,000 gp a sail. Despite the cost, many a sailor will argue their incredible utility, as the sails themselves absorb solar energy and output power, eliminating the need for an engine almost entirely.
