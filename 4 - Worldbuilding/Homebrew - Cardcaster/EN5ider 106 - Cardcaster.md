An elf pulls the Emperor from her tarot deck and fixes the card to her friend's fate. The barbarian charges into battle, and the enemy archers hesitate due to the Emperor's protective influence. The barbarian smashes them all.

AGOLDEN-EYED DRAGONBORN WITH tarot in spread reads a fellow adventurer's fortune and flips to reveal Death. The adventurer gasps, but the dragonborn raises a hand. "Do not worry, my child," she coos. "This card merely represents change... Inevitable, irrevocable change."

## SEERS OF FATE

A cardcaster derives her powers from the tarot-a deck of mysterious cards purported to divine the future. By opening her mind to the tarot's whims, the cardcaster can exert a degree of control over fate. Though cardcasters are sometimes maligned for practicing an inscrutable and unreliable art, their proponents recognize that what a cardcaster sacrifices in predictability she makes up for in adaptability. By accepting the cards she is dealt, the cardcaster can see actions play out as foretold and issue a masterful response.

## Creating a Cardcaster

As a cardcaster, one of the most important relationships is the one you have with your tarot set. Did you inherit your cards from a wizened teacher, or did you uncover the set and its powers on your own? Are your card powers ones you invoke yourself, or are they instead a spontaneous upwelling of fate?

have less than a full hand, draw until your hand is full. When you complete a long rest, discard whatever cards you wish from your hand, then shuffle the deck and discard pile together and refill your hand. Both the hand size and the number of plays improve as per the Cardcaster table.

When you play a tarot card from her hand, it unleashes a spell effect. Each card gives you an option of effects. To activate a card power, you must provide all the spell components, just like casting a spell (some of which may be automatically filled by the tarot deck as an arcane focus). A card power's activation time is the same as the chosen spell's casting time.

## Spellcasting Ability

Intelligence is your key ability for cardcaster features, powers, and spells, since you discern portents through your esoteric knowledge. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving
throw DC for your cardcaster features, powers, or spells, or when making a spell attack roll.

- Spell and feature save DC $=8+$ your proficiency bonus + your INT modifier
- Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your INT modifier


## Ritual Casting

You can cast a divination spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell memorized. Furthermore, if a card in your hand has an optional spell with the ritual tag, you can cast that spell as a ritual without discarding the card.

## Memorizing Divination Rituals

When you find a divination ritual spell of 1st level or higher, you can memorize it only if a cleric or wizard of your cardcaster level could prepare it, and you spare the time to practice it.

For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp , like a wizard copying

---

a spell into their spellbook. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the incense burnt to channel your mystical focus. Once you have spent this time and money, you can cast the divination ritual at will.

If you multiclass into a spellcasting class, you are considered to know these spells and may prepare them if such spells appear on the other classes' spell lists.

## Spell Focus

You can use an arcane focus or a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your cardcaster spells. While you have your tarot set on your person, you can use any card from it as an arcane focus.

## Focus Card

At ist level, you have chosen a face card of the minor arcana through which to channel your powers: Knight of Swords, Page of Wands, or Queen of Cups, all detailed at the end of the class description.

Your choice grants you features at ist level, and again at 2nd, 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

## Arcana Surge

Starting at 3rd level, your high arcana grow in power. Spells you cast through your tarot cards which benefit from higher level spell slots are cast as though with a 2nd-level spell slot.

This further improves with level:

- 7th to 8th level: 4rd-level spell slot.
- 9th level onward: 5 rd-level spell slot.

your hand, and it does not count against the number of cards in your hand. You can play it as often as you like without consuming your daily uses, but doing so does not benefit from Arcana Surge.

By spending 8 hours in contemplation, you can change your card choice.

## Signature Card

At 20th level, choose a major arcana card numbered VI-IX. This card is always in your hand, and it does not count against the number of cards in your hand. You can play this card twice without expending the normal usage, but doing so does not benefit from Arcana Surge. You regain these extra plays once you complete a short or long rest.

## Major Arcana

Each card entry lists spell options. When you play the card, you cast one spell from that list of your choice. Some cards have restrictions that limit how they can be used.
