# North Ward

![img-69.jpeg](assets/Volo's%20Guide%20To%20Waterdeep_img-69.jpeg)  
orth Ward is the quietest ward of the city. This district is home to most of Waterdeep's wealthier middle classes and lesser noble families. It is an area of quiet neighborhoods dominated by private, walled noble villas. Little of interest meets the visitor's eye, but local talk says much plotting and partying goes on behind closed doors in this reach of the city-intrigue that affects trade, wars, and wealth as far away as Thay. Yet, unless you come to the city already in the know as a member of this or that guild, cabal, merchant alliance, or underground network, there is actually little in North Ward for you to see.

Aside from folk strolling to or from their homes or private parties, this area practically shuts down at dusk. It is often so quiet that a man talking in the street can be heard by others outdoors several streets away!

Watch patrols are frequent,  
but are polite and lightly armed. ${ }^{1}$ Rowdiness and street violence of any sort are not tolerated in this ward unless one is noble or welldressed and drunk. Those who engage in such activities are quickly and roughly handled by the city watch.

### Landmarks

The only widely known ward landmark is the Gentle Mermaid, ${ }^{2}$ whose fame as a gambling hall has spread up and down the Sword Coast. A more interesting evening can be spent at the Misty Beard tavern, ${ }^{3}$ a refined but often lively drinking spot staffed largely by exotic and monstrous beings from all over the Realms. The ward is dominated by the ornate walls, spires, wrought iron work, and balconies of many walled villas and grand houses, but only the lucky or privileged visitor sees more of these than can be glimpsed from the street. Two noble families, the Hawkwinters and the Roaring-

[^0]: ${ }^{1}$ City watch patrols are detailed on page 17 of FR1 Waterdeep and the North. In this ward,four-sword detachments (more often female officers than in any other ward of the city) pass a given point about every 15 minutes, and look in to a tavern or inn dining room about every 40 minutes.

    As detailed on pages 17 and 23 of the City System set booklet, the city guard also patrols North Ward, in six-man detachments. Typical patrol details are as given therein, on page 23. Reinforcements will be a dozen LG hm F3s to F6s clad in chain mail and armed with maces, long swords, daggers, slings, and a polearm appropriate to the situation.

    Guard patrols pass a given street location about every 50 minutes, but appear in 1d6 minutes when a city watch patrol blows a warning horn in this ward.

horns, often give large, splendid parties at their villas. ${ }^{4}$ I'll give you what I can recall of these splendid houses. My memory is rather spotty though, as the delicious wines served were both plentiful and strong!

Only two guildhalls stand in this ward: the House of Crystal ${ }^{5}$ and the House of Healing. ${ }^{6}$ The House of Crystal houses the headquarters of the Guild of Glassblowers, Glaziers, \& Specu-lum-Makers, where one can buy the finest crystal balls and mirrors, ranging in prices from 1 sp for a curved ladies' handglass to 600 gp for a sphere of perfect crystal as large around as a small shield. The House of Healing is the headquarters for the Guild of Apothecaries \& Physicians, who do very well here as an emergency hospital and vendor of medicines and potions. The House of Healing is a place many tragically diseased folk or their agents come specially to Waterdeep to visit.  
Several shopkeepers in this wealthy clean district, however, are heads-spokemasters-of  
their respective guilds. Darion Sulmest of Sulmest's Splendid Shoes \& Boots ${ }^{7}$ is the public contact of the Order of Cobblers \& Corvisers. (His boots and shoes are splendid, too. I'm wearing a warm, springy pair of his lifelong swashboots right now and they are worth every single copper of the 12 gp they cost me. Pairs not guaranteed to last as long as the wearer can be had for 8 gp or less.) Shalrin Maerados of Maerados Fine Furs ${ }^{8}$ is Gentleman Keeper of the Solemn Order of Recognized Furriers \& Woolmen. And Relchoz Hriiat of Hriiat Fine Pastries ${ }^{9}$ speaks for the Bakers' Guild.

There are also whispers about stolen goods (and even smuggling!). The largest and most exotic things, they say-ships and golems, for example-can be bought and sold through a certain noble resident in the ward. I was unable to contact him, and dare not reveal his name here, for fear of spreading malicious, "bladed" tonguework. Discreet word can be left for him at the Grinning Lion tavern. ${ }^{10}$
