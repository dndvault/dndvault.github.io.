# The Old

### Monster Shop

This little-known shop fronts on the Jar, a close that opens off Tilman's Lane not far from the Trollwall. There a stone warehouse sports a door marked with: "Beware Guardian Monsters Within." It is flanked by a pair of tall, massive, arched cart doors.

Inside, a nondescript-looking man named Feldyn Goadolfyn sells monsters to the hungry, the bored, and the vengeful.

### The Place

This ugly poorly built warehouse is littered with dust and rubble. It smells of animal dung and damp.

The upper floors are largely empty, ${ }^{24}$ but visitors entering by the door are immediately confronted by a hungrily interested gargoyle perched on the swinging gate of a service counter.

Behind the counter sits Feldyn, who's usually examining a map or a worn copy of a crude monthly illustrated chapbook. He always appears calm, even bored. An adventurer who once saw him threatened with a cockatrice said he didn't even blink, but  
merely yawned and told the cockatrice-holder to state his business.

### The Prospect

Shops where one can buy live monsters are rare anywhere in Faerun. ${ }^{25}$ A surprisingly large number of folk make their ways as unobtrusively as possible to Feldyn's doors. His clientele include jaded nobles looking for exotic things to hunt, eat, or play with; those who want to create a sensation at parties or with traveling shows, or just acquire a wall trophy they can boast about; adventurers in need of practice; breeders and wizards needing live material for their researches, and so on.

In pools, cages, and a variety of imprisoning containers in his cellars, Feldyn keeps an everchanging roster of monsters to sell to them. He also has a room of jugged, jarred, or coffered remnants, from horns and bottled gore to pelts and scales.

These valuables are guarded by a loyal (trained or magically controlled) staff of guardian monsters: four watchspiders, ${ }^{26}$ two gargoyles (Feldyn controls them with a ring of gargoyles ${ }^{27}$ ), two mimics (a killer mimic that poses as a bar on the inside of the

He uses the three rambling, rundown upper floors of the warehouse to house these crates, and won't accept uncrated things.

cart doors, and a space mimic ${ }^{28}$ that pretends to be the door at the bottom of the cellar stairs most of the time), and a femalelooking stone golem known as Ouldra. In case of attack, Feldyn will flee to the cellars, ${ }^{29}$ trusting to his ring of spell turning to keep him safe as his monsters spring to the attack.

### The People

The owner of the Old Monster Shop, Feldyn, is evil, coldly calm, and unscrupulous. He gets even, but he does not hate. He uses his unremarkable appearance to  
adopt whatever disguises he deems necessary when following foes through Waterdeep. Whenever outside his shop, Feldyn is armed with a pair of golden lion figurines of wondrous power.

Feldyn will purchase monsters, including eggs and young. He does not like to handle magically transformed or petrified monsters (to minimize his personal danger). Badly wounded or dead beasts fetch very little from him.

He sometimes hires adventurers who have brought him lots of monsters to get specific monsters to order or to slay or kidnap folk

who have become his foes. Among residents of Waterdeep, his recent contacts have included the Company of the Bloody Banner, a fellowship of a dozen evil female half-elves, and the Weird Company; an evil adventuring band dominated by six wizards.

### The Prices

Feldyn buys cheap and sells expensive. Most beasts go for at least 1000 gp . Prices increase with a creature's danger and rarity. ${ }^{30}$ Monster parts are much cheaper-usually 40 gp to 250 gp , depending on what they are.

Whenever authorities look into his shop, Feldyn claims to be in business largely to serve the kitchens of Waterdeep, with a few noble patrons who love hunting as special patrons. He shows his selection of monster parts, keeps his guardian mon-  
sters (except for the golem) out of view and gives out free copies of two of his most famous recipes: dragon soup and roasted cockatrice. Not being a member of the city guard, I had to pay 1 sp per recipe-but I've since been able to try them both, and the results were delicious!

### Travelers' Lore

Some who live near the Old Monster Shop claim they've seen folk go inside it and never come out again-and also seen folk (and worse!) come out that they swear never went in.

Members of the Watchful Order who have too much drink say more. Some claim Feldyn has some sort of monster in the depths of his cellars that gives birth to other creatures. Others claim that he has several gates that link him to faraway places in the Realms. ${ }^{31}$

[^0]: ${ }^{30}$ As a rule of thumb, Feldyn's price in gold pieces will equal the listed XP value of a monster.  
    ${ }^{31}$ Both of these tales are true. Feldyn has a deepspawn hidden in his cellar (a monster detailed in FR11 Dwarves Deep) and a row of unmarked closet doors that are actually the entrances to a webwork of two-way gates connecting his shop with

    - An Underdark cavern, near Menzoberranzan (a drow city detailed in the Menzoberranzan set)  
    -Somewhere in the jungles of Chult
    - A ravine in the Stonelands north of Cormyr near the Haunted Halls (detailed in FRQ1 The Haunted Halls of Eveningstar)
    - A glade deep in the High Forest (see FR5 The Savage Frontier)
    - A knoll in the Sword Coast North, near Everlund (The Savage Frontier)
    - A valley in Amn in the hills north of Amnwater (see FR3 Empires of the Sands)
    - The edge of Anauroch near Spellgard (see FR13 Anauroch)
    - A clearing in the Wild Wood (Demall Forest) in Alaron in the Moonshae Isles (see FA1 Halls of the High King and FR2 Moonshae)  
    -Somewhere on the third level of Undermountain, just outside Skullport.

    Feldyn and his hired adventurers use these to gather monsters. They have caches of food and gear hidden near most of their exit gates.

    In his shop, Feldyn has over 56,000 gp, in bags of 100 gp each, stashed inside hollow pillars in the cellars. He also has a chest visible for the taking (containing 540 gold pieces and several false treasure maps) and his best chest. His best chest is a dark coffer high on a gloomy shelf above and inside a doorway on the cellar stairs that holds 12 rubies, 8 star sapphires, and 2 emeralds-each worth $5,000 \mathrm{gp}$-as well as 4 trade bars of silver, worth 25 gp each, and two potions of extra-healing in steel vials.
