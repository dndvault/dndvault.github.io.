# The Fiery Fagon

### Tavern

### 䍐䍐䍐 DDD

This odd, cramped place ${ }^{7}$ stands on the west side of Seawatch Street, across the street from the House of Inspired Hands. A relic of the time when sailors lived on the mud flats north of Mount Waterdeep and the rich had yet to migrate north from Castle Waterdeep, it is famous among sailors up and down the Sword Coast, who throng to visit it when they make land at the city.

### The Place

I found the wide, iron-barred door of this dark, ramshackle place late at night. I thought it was just on the edge of the ward, not in its depths, but I walked past tall house after tall house.

When I came at last to the Flagon, I couldn't believe how small it was. Inside, it descended in a series of steps, opening into a cellar level larger than is aboveground. Yet there is scarce room for all the fish, flotsam, and ships' gear that crowds the place.

As I went in, water shone back at me from tanks of sullen, gliding blackjaws, moon-faced clearfins, and the dangerous kgrench. All around were nets, blown-glass floats, anchors, and wave-worn figureheads.

The awesome skeleton of an eye of the deep hung overhead. Lamps set in its eye sockets cast an eerie, flickering glow over all.

### The Prospect

The interior of the Flagon is not at all the slick, expensive watering hole one expects in Sea Ward-for that, go to Gounar's or the Ship's Wheel. Yet unlike the rough bars of Dock Ward, the place felt safe, like a refuge from the storms of the sea. It even creaks and groans just like a ship when winds blow high. It was full of sailors eager to spin yarns of the sea's mysteries over plentiful drink and the freshest fish to be had in the city.

### The Provender

Food in the Flagon means cheese, grapes, bread, and lots and lots of seafood-seafood hauled live and dripping from tanks all around the place, and cooked, swiftly and expertly, in front of your eyes. Sailors can bring their own catch to be cooked, too, but the wise guests leave their palates in the care of the four cooks, grizzled old seamen who know just what will make a particular fish or deep-sea creature taste the best. Try the fried sea snake!

old man named Ulscaleer Anbersyr. A retired sea captain, he seems to know everyone and is said to have fabulously rich pirate treasures hidden away somewhere in the city. Some told me he quietly supplies pirates with food and gear as well as fencing goods for them. ${ }^{8}$

### The Prices

The ruffians and lowlives are kept out by the prices. The splendid but simple meals are 7 $\mathrm{sp} /$ plate, and drink goes by the tankard: 3 coppers for rough ale, 5 coppers for good ale, 1 sp for zzar, and then steeply upwards for wine and spirits, up to 14 gp for the best firebelly whiskey.

Ulscaleer is proud of the fact that you can't drink even the finest wine out of anything but a tankard in his place. He has little use for dandified nobles and snobs of any sort.

### Travelers' Lore

The Flagons damp cellars are said to have a hidden tunnel, that winds down a long away by stair and ladder shaft to caverns near to a strange, lawless place in the depths called Skullport. ${ }^{9}$ Ulscaleer, I was told, charges 5 gp to open the stoutly barred, magically protected ${ }^{10}$ door that seals the cellar off from the top of the  
![img-44.jpeg](assets/Volo's%20Guide%20To%20Waterdeep_img-44.jpeg)  
tunnel. All openings are performed by a half-dozen armed men. Ulscaleer keeps some sort of magical wand at the ready during such openings. Much illicit trade passes this way, with the Lords of Waterdeep being none the wiser.

I also heard something about a Sea Ghost-a dripping wraith of a drowned pirate, festooned with seaweed, that pursues those who meddle in the affairs of pirates. Regular patrons told me, however, such talk was just nonsense put about to scare off the overly inquisitive. ${ }^{11}$

[^0]
[^0]: ${ }^{8}$ Elminster says these tales are true.  
    ${ }^{9}$ And so, he affirms, is this tale.  
    ${ }^{10}$ It turns spells as a ring of spell turning, sounding an alarm gong whenever this defense is activated.  
    ${ }^{11}$ Elminster's not so sure this is only empty words!

Other Places of Interest in Sea Ward

If one tires of opulence and isn't hungry to brave the dangers of the sinister Dragon Tower of the wizard Maaril or the fool-swallowing Blue Alley, what else is there to do in Sea Ward? Perhaps, gossip? Yes, the Street of Whispers didn't get that name for nothing. But gossip's a game visitors play to learn what to see and where to go. One has to be a resident to really enjoy gossip.

You can also shop. You can spend a lot of money very quick-  
ly and easily in Sea Ward. We've all seen overpriced goods, so I've tried to pick out some outstanding or useful establishments.

### Shops

### Aurora's Realms Shop "Singing Dolphin" Catalogue Counter

This is the Sea Ward outlet of the famous Faerun-wide all goods retail chain. It occupies the third shopfront north from the corner of the Street of the Singing Dolphin and Grimwald's Way, on the west side of the Dolphin.

It has six guards who work in shifts of three and three, and who wear sparkling weapons

and finery; a handsome male counter clerk of impeccable taste and great tact, Orloth Theldarin; and a service mage of many rings, airs, and grand entrances, Saerghon "the Magnificent" Alir. Saerghon thinks himself the greatest mage in Waterdeep, but hasn't even opened all the tomes and scrolls he's acquired down through the years.

### Halazar's Pine Gems

### 33333

This shop has a glistening black front kept shiny with magic. In  
its center gleams a single sparkling gem the size of a man's head (an illusion). Those touching the gem feel a wrenching shock as the magic temporarily drains them of a small amount of energy to sustain itself. ${ }^{12}$

Inside are truly the finest gems one can find for sale, exquisitely cut and mounted, displayed in glass cases with severe simplicity and sold for precisely four times what they'd fetch anywhere else. Waterdeep being what it is, the gems do sell, as folk proudly boast of how much they paid. The security ${ }^{13}$ arrangements are confidential, but powerful.

[^0]
[^0]: ${ }^{12}$ Halazar's is location \#50 on the color map. The illusion magic drains 1 hp , which can be recovered in any normal manner, to power itself.  
    ${ }^{13}$ Rumors of gargoyles, Elminster hints, are not unfounded.

Proprietor: Stromquil Halazar, Guildmaster of the Jewellers' Guild is the proprietor. He is a tall, aristocratic, sneering man of soft words and watchful eyes.

### Selchoun's Sundries Shop

### 11111

This shop has those tourist knickknacks that travelers swiftly grow to hate (such as toy wooden shields emblazoned with the words: "I Saw Waterdeep and Survived!") but it is also the only place in the entire ward where you can buy string, and  
thongs, and kindling and flint, and clay pipes, and carrysacks, and - you catch my thrust? Very useful to the visitor.

Proprietor: Osbrin Selchoun, a fat, very short man with a rolling gait and a cheerful, huffing nature, is the proprietor. ${ }^{14}$

### Taverns

gems everywhere to catch and throw back the many glowing globes that hang in the air. It's bright because citizens go here to be seen and to survey each other as much as to relax over a drink.

The words slick and on display come to mind. On the other hand, if you want to be noticed in Waterdhavian high society, this is the place. Expect to pay $6 \mathrm{gp} /$ glass for drinks and double that for quality wines. If bought by the bottle, drinks are 25 gp and up.

Proprietor: Doblin Gounar is the proprietor. Doblin is a coldly egotistical hard nose-the sort you hate on sight. ${ }^{15}$

Proprietress: Amasanna Vumendir is a dusky-skinned, agile hostess of few words but a keen intellect. She orders her staff about with hand gestures. ${ }^{17}$

### Maerghoun's Inn

![img-49.jpeg](assets/Volo's%20Guide%20To%20Waterdeep_img-49.jpeg)

Located on the west side of the Street of Whispers, just north of Diamond Street, this old, opulent inn of scented purple hangings, flickering lamps, and dark wood paneling is much favored by  
young couples and by Waterdeep's paid escorts. No food or drink is available, but you are free to bring it in or have it delivered. Utmost discretion is observed. Each room has inner curtains, so that staff can bring things or do things in one part of a room without seeing or being seen by the guests in another part of the same room.

Maerghoun's is notable for its large round beds, complimentary purple silken house robes, and soundproofing. Extreme privacy is the watch word. The inn is used by many to conduct sensitive business deals.

### Pilgrims' Rest

### 1999 1999

Located in the triangular northwestern angle of the intersection of Diamond Street and Satchel Alley, this is the humblest of Sea Ward's inns and the cheapest. It's usually crammed with faithful worshippers who have come to  
the city to visit one of the temples (hence its name). There's actually nothing special about this placewhich means that it would be a first-class inn anywhere else in the whole of Faerun. One can get a private room for $9 \mathrm{gp} /$ night, with stabling and a solid evening meal included in the price. A two-share (two double beds, usually rented to two couples) is 6 $\mathrm{gp} /$ bed per night. A common room ( 8 beds or more) is $4 \mathrm{gp} /$ night per person.

Proprietor: Balaghast Brightlingar is a grim, hard-working exwarrior, whose gruff manner conceals a sincerely kind heart,

### The Wandering Wemic

### 1999 1999

Located in the angle between an alley and two streets, this large, recently opened inn offers ample, airy, well-lit rooms, new furnishings, clean surroundings, high rates, and an efficient, numerous staff-including bouncers to keep undesirables out. The $10 \mathrm{gp} /$ room per day rate includes stabling, a valet service for cleaning and repairing  
clothes and boots, and a bottle of wine per head per evening, but no food. It provides a good place for wealthy merchants who want no trouble over a place to stay.

Proprietor: A big, easygoing man, Cheth Thanion is far more alert than he seems. He never forgets a face or anyone doing him out of money. ${ }^{20}$

Seawatch Street, just south of its intersection with Diamond Street, this is one of the most famous pleasure palaces of the Sword Coast. For decades, its name has been synonymous with decadent dalliance. Its trademark is the sheer purple silks worn by its ladies.

Inside, it's a series of warm, carpeted rooms crowded with cushions, bold guests, and bolder staff ladies. Not a place for the bashful. Highly recommended. Rumored to have contraband hidden inside some cushions, and under certain areas of carpet.

Proprietress: The proprietress, Jathaliira Thindrel, is petite, pert, and always bustling about. A guest who insisted on her company at his every visit described her as having "a shrewish temper overlaid by a passionate nature." She is in her forties, but still energetic and good-looking, and is reputed to be a shrewd investor and very rich. ${ }^{21}$

### Alleys

Sea Ward's alleys are the playground of the rich, famous, reckless, and utterly undisci-

plined - but they are clean and either short or wide, offering the armed and careful person plenty of fighting or running room.

### Cloaksweep Alley

This wide, very short passage runs north off Zarimitar Street due north of the Courtyard of the Well. Its name comes from an incident involving the long-ago wizard Milist Samblin of the Many Cloaks-who, when set upon by thieves in this alley used  
a cloak that swallowed them whole in one flap. They were never seen again! ${ }^{22}$

Today, the alley is notable as the usual vending place of a nameless old man who sells ear oil. Made of the fat of adders boiled down into oil, it is thought by many to be a cure for deafness when poured into the ears. I shudder at the very thought.

### The Ghostwalk

off the southern half of Murlpar Street and curls around the interior of the city block it's found in, providing delivery access and garbage storage for the businesses and homes located here. It boasts several shadowtops (climbing trees that local children spend much time playing in). It's also known to be the place where the ghost of a long-ago noble rake, a harmless but frightening phantom, walks. He carries a drawn sword and whispers, "I've killed him! I've killed him!" as he staggers along, his own fresh blood welling out and down him until he's entirely covered - and fades away.

### Gondwatch Lane

### $\int$

This alley runs along the southern wall of the House of Inspired Hands, Waterdeep's temple of Gond. The temple's main entry gate opens onto it, and it is named for its use by locals to watch the latest explosive or otherwise entertaining results of inventions dedicated to Gond.

If inventions seem too dangerous to operate within the temple, they're often tried here. Things can get quite dangerous! Locals are generally unconcerned, and stand watching while food vendors circulate among them.

### Kulzar's Alley

This alley runs south from the Wallway to join with Rook Alley. It is named for a famous local sailor, who dwelt here before his death some 70 winters ago. Kulzar was master of a ship appropriately known as the Lost Luck, which ran aground on shoals near Waterdeep one stormy night and broke up. Kulzar, a man of terrific strength, swam his personal cabinhold treasure ashore chest by chest through the crashing surf, and is reputed to have hidden it somewhere in or under this alley

Many have looked, but Kulzar's gems and coins have never been found. Any folk who try digging for them will attract the attention of the city watch, who'll require that they replace the paving stones when they're done and forbid any tunneling towards the city wall. Diggers will also attract the attention of certain old sailors, who'll shadow the treasure-seekers in hopes that they'll discover Kulzar's "jools" and can then be robbed.

### Moarinskoar Alley

This alleyway curls around the

---

![img-56.jpeg](assets/Volo's%20Guide%20To%20Waterdeep_img-56.jpeg)  
interior of the city block bounded by Mendever, Vondil, Sul, and Delzorin Streets, and is named for a famous ancestor of the Irlingstar noble family, whose villa is partly encircled by the alley. Moarinskoar rebelled against the family hopes and dictates, and ran away to sea to become a famous shipmaster. After a long, successful trading career on the Sword Coast, he turned pirate-and is said to sail his ship still, as a wight commanding a zombie crew. The Moonwind, his fast caravel, ${ }^{23}$ is now a ghost ship, still seen scud-  
ding along the Sword Coast. Moarinskoar tries to board all the ships he meets. If a ship is bound for Waterdeep, he does not attack, but demands that it deliver a message to the Irlingstars: "Tell my mother I love her; but I'm not ready to come home yet." Local lore whispers that when he does come back, this peaceful alley will become a killing ground haunted by his undead crew!
