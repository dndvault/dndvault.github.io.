# Hawkwinter House

The city villa of this quietly powerful Waterdhavian noble family ${ }^{16}$ is the site of many splendid parties.

On a strategic corner location in a block of fine merchants' houses and luxury apartments, ${ }^{17}$ the walled Hawkwinter compound consists of three spired, balconied stone houses made in the likeness of miniature castles with crenelations, gargoyleshaped downspouts and arched windows only found in the uppermost reaches of the walls. The only exceptions to this design lie in the tall-peaked tiled roofs, which shed copious snow down onto passersby in winter. Some folk believe the downspouts are real gargoyles that the family can release to defend their home. These are kept immobile by strong enchantments controlled by the Hawkwinters.

These miniature castles are linked by winding garden paths, overhung by many old, carefully tended trees, hung with lamps.

When parties are thrown,  
![img-73.jpeg](assets/Volo's%20Guide%20To%20Waterdeep_img-73.jpeg)  
many-hued driftglobes light every corner of the gloomy halls, passages, and cellars of the castles, and perfume is added to the lamps amid the trees.

Musicians play in chambers here and there, and mages are hired to perform minor illu-sions-either of languid beauty in the early evening or of mystery danger, and spice later, when those who celebrate until the dawn chase each other around the balconied rooms and dungeons. Oh, yes, these castles have dungeon cells. They cells are very clean and lit with red torches for show but functional-and, I

[^0]: ${ }^{16}$ Traditionally a strong arm of the city guard and troops fielded by the Lords of Waterdeep, the Hawkwinters hunt and breed highly prized war horses on extensive country estates north of nearby Amphail. They spend much of their time there, and make most of their money selling horses in peacetime. In times of war, they serve as mercenary generals and guides, hire out their own cavalry, and work as high-priced, lightning-fast troop outfitters.

    Their best mounts are black with silver manes and tails. A rare few have blue eyes that glow in the dark-they have $120^{\prime}$ infravision and, some warriors swear, a rarer few can even see invisible creatures and items as auras, within $70^{\prime}$. Wizards are especially eager to purchase Hawkwinter horses. They are bred to accept spells hurled nearby and from their backs calmly.  
    ${ }^{2}$ The villa is \#151 on the color map. Apartments in the same block rarely fall vacant. When they do, rooms are typically $35 \mathrm{gp} /$ month and up, with the first season (six months) paid in advance.

doubt not, used from time to time.

Conversation and tales from afar are valued to stave off the boredom that threatens nobles, so adventurers and those newly arrived in the city are welcome as guests. The doors are not open to all, though. Waterdhavian nobles invite a select list of folk: usually Piergeiron, out of courtesy although he but rarely attends such fetes; other nobles with whom the family is on speaking terms; mages and other fashionable or powerful personages, such as guildmasters; and the occasional very successful merchant in some sort of dignified trade.

These guests are expected to bring their spouses or an escort, and from two to six guests eachwho may be anyone, such as the aforementioned adventurers and other walking entertainment. Those with ideas of slipping such feasts (elsewhere in Faerun, the term crashing is often used) are warned that nobles' doorwards and bouncers are mighty, experienced, quick, and reinforced by  
magic and might of arms that even successful adventurers respect-from a safe distance?

Want to get invited? Let it be known around the city that you're newly arrived and either an adventurer of import or that interesting things befell you that you can tell or, even better, show something about. With a smile or two from the gods, someone will invite you. A young, ardent female escort invited me to the party I attended, on the condition that I wear a rather humiliating outfit and address her in an extremely deferential manner. In the interests of seeing what would otherwise be denied me, I agreed-and was treated to a wild evening of flirtation, drink, splendid food, ${ }^{19}$ and gossip.

As to the goings-on, let me say merely that on such occasions, the nobles of Waterdeep are ruled by their whims. Fancy costumes, exotic food and drink, even more exotic entertain-ment-let me tell you, tales you may have heard in your local tavern of the decadence and wild ways of Waterdeep are all true.

[^0]
[^0]: ${ }^{18}$ There are presently four F12s in the Hawkwinter ranks, and even the slightest Hawkwinter maiden can call on the gargoyles and on more than two dozen magical crossbows that wait behind walls both inside and outside of the castles.

    Elminster assures us the gargoyles are real and $100 \%$ loyal to those of the family blood. Once loosed, they must taste blood before they can be commanded back into station. When commanded by word and will, the magical crossbows appear (stone panels slide aside) and fire two heavy quarrels per round, at THAC0 7, for normal damage ( $1 \mathrm{~d} 4+1$ vs.M). Their activator must be of the family blood and need only speak the correct word within $90^{\prime}$ of a concealed bow and mentally select the target or targets. The word is different for each crossbow. A bow can fire at up to two targets per round.  
    ${ }^{19}$ Waterdeep boasts many hire-cooks, notably Brazaun of Baldur's Gate and Kathliira Salarth, who descend on your kitchens and whip up fantastic hand-food for feasts if you stock your larders beforehand to their specifications. Noble families pride themselves on having kitchen staff who can outshine these justifiably famous culinary artists.

As to the gossip: At parties, nobles can meet-to exchange items, for example-without eyes noticing or tongues whispering, but rarely conduct important business. That's what they have large walled houses with many closed doors for. They do use parties to meet with, manipulate, and arrange future meetings and business with underlings, outsiders, and newcomers. I saw more than two adventuring bands hired in the time it took me to drain a tiny glass of firewine at the feast I attended.

Also, such parties are the only place that outsiders and common folk are likely to hear nobles gossiping about nobles firsthand.

The alert listener can learn a lot from a tone of voice, raised eyebrow or lip, or when and how long someone pauses when they are speaking.

The folk who attend Hawkwinter parties are eccentric and powerful-and, if they're noble, up to something all the time. The scent of masked danger is always in the air.

Truly, a Waterdhavian noble's feast is something all should enjoy. If you manage to acquire an invitation to one, by all means go out of your way to ensure that you get to go. However, I plan to attend my next one in my own clothes-or at least in a slightly more dignified outfit.

### The Misty Beard

### Tavern

### 1999 0000

This interesting place stands on a corner hard by the east wall of the city, where its noise and crowding create as few problems with the refined neighborhood as possible. Its signboard depicts a laughing bearded sailor, with beads of water glistening in a rainbow all over his beard. ${ }^{20}$ Minor enchantments make these droplets gleam, sparkle, and change hue from time to time.

The Beard is famous up and down the Sword Coast because it is staffed largely by exotic and monstrous beings from all over the Realms: halflings, lizard men, killmoulis, myconids, faerie dragons, spectators, and even, in the kitchens and cellars, skeletons and zombies ${ }^{21}$ under the command of other beings. There are also shapeshifting and illu-sion-using creatures on staff. As one regular patron put it, "You never know just what you'll see and for most of us, it's the only time we're every likely to see some of these creatures."

Their presence attracts a lot of thrill-seekers, and many visitors of the creatures' own kind. All are welcome, in an uneasy truce enforced by the magical powers of the wand-wielding owners.

### The Place

This clean, well-mannered tavern (in such mixed company all folk tend to be extra polite) is a solidlooking stone building with large arched windows, downspouts carved into the likenesses of beautiful winged maidens, and a steeply pitched slate roof. It rises four floors above the street. This was once a tavern known as the Cat and Songbird, but its owners were members of the Thieves Guild, and perished bloodily in an assassination attempt on the gathered Lords of Waterdeep.

![img-77.jpeg](assets/Volo's%20Guide%20To%20Waterdeep_img-77.jpeg)

### The Prospect

The interior of the Misty Beard is a well-lit jumble of booths and cozy chairs salvaged from sales all over the city. The rooms all open into a central well, where various stairs curve and zigzag up and down, and winged waiters dart from bar to table with single glasses. The waiters are sprites, who are hired here for month-long shifts, by which time they're usually sick of the city and flit home.

### The Provender

Food in the Beard tends to be of the breadstick and cheese dip  
variety. The garlic butter is justly famous, and a wonderful gooseberry jam is made on the premises. The fruit is brought in from High Hill, the owners' estates northeast of the city. There is also very good sausage and morkoth soup, which varies in ingredients. Morkoth soup is one of those simmer-all-day throw-in-whatever's about concoctions. The food is filling, but bland. The varied clientele hold little seasoning in common high regard.

### The People

The half-elven mages who own the place are two wand-wield-

---

ing ${ }^{22}$ sisters, Allet and Vindara Tzuntzin, who once ran the Black Gryphon inn in Elturel. Their monstrous friends and visitors were not welcomed in that city, so they sold out and came to cosmopolitan Waterdeep, where they soon tired of making beds, so they turned their inn into a tavern. The taverns name refers to a private joke between them, involving a bet, a Waterdhavian sailor, and some magic.

The bartender at the Beard is Munzrim Marlpar, a dignified, fearless lizard man of unusual height and intellect. He was outcast from his kin in the Marsh of Chelimber because of those features. He's usually to be found deep in conversation with a beholder-like, deadly looking spectator floating behind the bar: Thoim Zalamm, who is something of a philosopher, and sometimes drifts out over the rooftops of the city on dark nights to spy on the endlessly entertaining doings of humans.

### The Prices

The Beard has a more varied and well-stocked cellar than anywhere in Waterdeep except perhaps Piergeiron's Palace itself. The many drinkables run from 3 $\mathrm{sp} /$ tankard for ale and $4 \mathrm{sp} /$ jack  
for zzar (the bargains) up to 12 $\mathrm{gp} /$ tallglass for most wines and exotic drinks. Bottles are always six times the price of a glass. Meals are $1 \mathrm{gp} /$ head for as much as you want to consume in one evening from what's on the menu that night.

### Travelers' Lore

There are many tales of the parties-and occasional brawlsat the Beard. The two sisters are quick to use their wands to keep racial fears and hostilities from erupting into full-scale slaughter, and this promise of safety is enough to attract a steady stream of the curious. A rare few citizens are comfortable drinking at the Beard as regulars, but it is a very popular place for lowincome merchants to use to impress out-of-town visitors and a common neutral ground meeting place for merchants and others engaged in difficult negotiations. A few private rooms can be rented for short periods at $10 \mathrm{gp} /$ hour. Some nights things turn into raucous sing-alongs-and as one Waterdhavian told me, "Until you've seen a spectator and a faerie dragon dancing on air together and struggling to harmonizewell, you've not seen Waterdeep!"

[^0]
[^0]: ${ }^{22}$ Each carries at least six wands on her person, one or two sheathed openly at her belt, and the others hidden down boottops, up sleeves, and so on. They own many, many wands, but a typical carried assortment is as follows:

    Allet: enemy detection, frost, magic missiles, misplaced objects, negation  
    Vindara: fear, fire, flame extinguishing, illusion, lightning, paralyzation, polymorphing.  
    The wand of misplaced objects is detailed in the Tome of Magic. All others can be found in the DMG.

### Homes

### The High House of Roaringhorn

This city villa of the Waterdhavian noble clan famous for its brawls, parties, and swashbuckling, pranksome approach to life is used to host a seemingly endless succession of feasts. Almost everyone is welcome. The Roaringhorns delight in breaking the heads of vandals and would-be thieves. Although such gatherings can be so crowded and noisy as to resemble a herd of oxen milling about, the down-on-theirluck of Waterdeep can often get food and drink at one of these festive gatherings and meet to conduct shady business, toothough its a bit like whispering secrets in a room full of listeners.

Their hospitality has made the Roaringhorns deeply loved among the citizenry of Waterdeep. Old men and street youths alike have been known to leap to the defense of a drunken Roaringhorn in Dock Ward at night. But their behavior has reduced this once-fine, huge walled villa ${ }^{23}$ to a well-worn shambles of torn and stained tapestries, splintered furniture, and empty rooms.

The Roaringhorns seem not to  
![img-79.jpeg](assets/Volo's%20Guide%20To%20Waterdeep_img-79.jpeg)  
care and never run short of funds. If it's ambiance you seek, their home is like an abandoned hold stripped bare-but there's always fun to be had there at least two nights in a tenday. The family's never short of volunteers when it announces mercenary hirings, either.

### Shops

### Aurora's Realms Shop Catalogue Counter

This is the North Ward outlet of the famous Faerun-wide all goods retail chain. Located next to the House of Healing in a narrow but grand old home converted to luxury apartments above the shop, Aurora's North fronts on the High Road. It has four guards who work in shifts of two and two, a stunningly beautiful but sharp-tongued

counter clerk, Phandalue Tarinthil, and a service-mage, Quirtan Ondever, who delights in acting mysterious and sinister.

### Maerados Fine Furs

### 䍐䍐

This shop sells stylish and wellmade furs - winter cloaks, vests, and caps for all, and year-round fashions for the lady of taste, breeding, and deep pockets. Secret pockets are standard in such garments, as are concealed push-daggers. Furs can be perfumed to order, but philandering nobles frown on this-it leaves a distinct scent trail to who one has been with.

Rumors speak of a guardian in the shop. One of the furs is really a living beast-some say a great cat, others a sort of sly furry cloaker-that preys on intruders when the shop is closed.

Proprietor: ShalrinMaerados, the Gentleman Keeper of his guild, is the proprietor. He is observant and soft-spoken. He adventures in his spare time and conceals several weapons on his person and in his shop. ${ }^{24}$

### Hriiat Fine Pastries

### 䍐䍐

This shop is a bustling place. Locals line up here when the  
smells tell them a fresh batch of something is ready for eating.

Hriiat's place (say Hur-REE-atz) is known not just for sweets, but for savory pastries, notably the bite-pie or the meal loaf. Among the sweets, the hand-sized al-mond-and-apple sugar tarts, at 1 cp each, are especially fine. Bitepies made of pork, beef, or curried mixed meats run to 2 cp each, and mixed fish bite-pies cost only 1 cp each. The meal loaf, a Hriiat original, is an egg-shaped stuffed roll as long as two man's hands full of a stir-fried mix of cooked vegetables and meat doused in a spicy mushroom sauce that visiting merchants trot across the city to get.

All these wares are made for eating in the street as one walks. Hriiat sells fine cloth belt-towels for this purpose. Hriiat food is a hearty treat not to be missed!

Proprietor: Relchoz Hriiat, the public contact for the Bakers' Guild, owns and runs this shop. He is short, stout, and jolly. He is always sampling his wares and offering bites to customers. ${ }^{25}$

going rate, and many boots can be bought with lifelong guarantees of free replacement for any reason save loss due to theft. Men's shoes, slippers and boots for both sexes are made to custom fit the customers foot. Off the shelf sizes are much cheaper than custom work, going for only twice the average cost. All work is stylish - so much so, I'm told, that Lady Galinda Raventree once attended a nobles' party clad only in her thigh-high Sulmest boots!

Proprietor: Darion Sulmest, the sarcastic and handsome spokesman for his guild, is the proprietor. He is a touch snob-  
bish but always interested in tales of adventuring. ${ }^{26}$

### Taverns

### A Maiden's Tears <br> 5555 DOOD

No tavern in this ward competes in prices with those elsewheredrink is dear, and rowdiness strongly discouraged. Nobles with a taste for brawling, color, or danger walk to more southerly wards for their fun. This place, named for the old Sword Coast legend that the best wine is the tears of a maiden whose suitor

turns away (or is slain), is quieter than most.

Soft lighting, deftly quiet service, and curtained booths make this a perfect and popular place for meetings-both for private intrigue, and encounters with ladies of the evening. Once you're seated, it is rare to even see other patrons, and the snoring betrays just how many unhappy nobles come here to drink zzar until they fall asleep.

The Tears is rated highly for its privacy and quiet. Some will find it a excrutiatingly boring place to lift a cup.

Zzar is $4 \mathrm{cp} /$ jack. Wines go up  
from there to $20 \mathrm{gp} /$ glass for Tashlutan dragonstongue. No menu is offered, but all drink orders include complimentary salted crackers, garlic-and-cheesemelt breads, and celery.

Proprietress: Zobia Shrinsha is the proprietress. She is quiet, watchful, and shy - like a little girl speaking to strangers. ${ }^{27}$

pent Street, this place, adorned with battle trophies (or faked battle trophies) from all over Faerun is as raucous as taverns get in North Ward. An old joke claims the Riven Shield Shop sends all shields beyond repair here, to hang on the walls.

The music is loud, with male and female dancers in fantastically styled and revealing mock armor swaying and pirouetting among the tables. Real, if broken, weapons hang on the walls everywhere, so disputes are swiftly discouraged by the bouncers. Grasping a patrons upper lip is an effective way to tow him to the door, one told me.

Food consists only of platters of fried onions and eels. I'm told you get to enjoy them, but I couldn't get past the revolting look and smell.

Folk really come here to drink-and drink they do, copiously at a price of $3 \mathrm{cp} /$ tankard of zżar and upwards. Most wine is $2 \mathrm{sp} /$ glass.

I'm told that a certain fat man on a stool at one end of the bar can help visitors buy and sell goods that are rather "warm." The only such patron I spoke to was very rude and emphatic in his rejections.

Proprietor: Unger Farshal, who owns and runs the Grinning Lion, is bald, close-mouthed, and dangerous-looking. ${ }^{28}$

### INNS

### The Cliffwatch

### 11111111

At the northeast corner of Endcliff Lane and Nindabar Street stands this rambling old inn-recognizable for its exterior galleries. These are continuous balconies running the entire length of the outside, a feature seen in Dock Ward and South Ward, but rarely in this well-to-do district. ${ }^{29}$ By night, find it by going to the Endcliff Tower on the city wall, and head west down the narrowest lane you can see. It's on the first corner on your right.

Inside, it's well worn, even shabby-but the cheerful, understanding keeper makes up for this. He's quick to hide warm goods or wanted folk, direct adventurers or visitors to where the oddest things can be found in the vast city, and to chat about rumors, treasure tales, and doings in the city in the old overstuffed armchairs in front of his roaring fireplace. For folk wanting only a comfortable, home-like place to stay; this is one of the best lodgings in the city.

Oh, by the way, tales of secret passages leading down to smugglers' storage cellars and thence to navigable reaches of the cellars are true. But the kindly

keeper advised me not on investigate too far unless I felt confident of my ability to defeat a beholder!

Proprietor: The amiable, but otherwise unremarkable, proprietor of the Cliffwatch is Felstan Spindrivver.

### The Galloping Minotaur

### 䒠䒠

Widely known among travelers, this inn has begun to slip in its service, relying on its name and convenient location ${ }^{30}$ for market vendors and for shoppers to keep its rooms full. And they are full; it's rare to find lodgings here, because the keeper has instituted the city's first system of advance bookings. Merchants valuing the guarantee of a place to stay in the city have gone for it to such an extent that the Minotaur has expanded to take in a former warehouse behind and a storefront beside the original inn. The cheaper rooms are located in the former warehouse, above the stables and below the servants.

Inside, this place is all bustle. Errandboys and newslungs (youths who arrive every hour or so, and for a handful of coppers from the innkeeper bellow out the current news to all in the salon) are always coming and going, merchants full of their own importance are always striding in all directions ("at  
once," as one serving maid dryly put it), and the mutter of business dealings fills the entire ground floor. The ground floor is given over to a lobby, the salon, and four private, rentable meeting rooms. The salon is an open lounge used by most guests and those they have dealings with. Servants tend the private rooms by means of passages behind the paneled walls in answer to the tug of a bellpull. Be warned that they can easily eavesdrop on what goes on within. All in all, a noisy, overpriced place-rather like paying high gold to sleep in an army camp.

Proprietor: Waendel Uthrund, a beady-eyed, sardonic man who is always alert, is the proprietor.

### The Raging Lion

### 䒠䒠

This little-known, fine old inn is highly recommended. Dominated by dark wood paneling, thick but worn carpets underfoot everywhere, and a strict rule against open flames of any sort including smoking, it is a quiet refuge from the bustle of the city being as close to the east wall as one can get. ${ }^{31}$ Light is provided by an assortment of glowing globes of different hues.

Dwarves and at least three bands of lady adventurers have adopted this place. Some live here

permanently, helping the proprietor keep order, and others use it as a base between expeditions into the northern Sword Coast. The Swordmaidens in particular are an impressive sight as they stride through the halls or dining room in full armor.

All rooms have their own bath and garderobe, and all have doors that can be locked and barred from within. All have locking bar-grates on the windows that can be swung up out of the way from within only. All have canopied four-poster beds of the sort usually reserved for nobility or royalty.

The ground floor is given over to kitchens and to a dining room where one can choose between beef, pork, or goat stews nightly each available either highly spiced as favored in the South or more moderately seasoned (which is more to my taste-I like to taste what I'm eating first, and the spices second).

During my meal, I found something that led to a very interesting adventure-about which I'll say only that in the better wards of Waterdeep, always check the underside of any chair or stool you sit in (if, and only if, you can do this unobserved by others!). Messages, coins, gems, weapons, and other valuable objects are often stuck, wedged, or fitted into recesses there for someone to pick up at a later time.

Two dwarves seem to live in the dining room, whittling little chains and lock mechanisms from various exotic woods, and sipping beer as they while each day away. I believe they take messages from dwarves, to pass on to other dwarves who come here to find them. Their names are Ilmairen and Jaerloon. They merely smiled when I asked their clan. They told me many interesting tales of the city in exchange for a tankard or two-including some things about a curious cult, embraced by some nobles of Waterdeep, that once used this inn as a place of worship.

Their temple still exists, as a cellar now crowded with casks, potatoes, mushroom frames and the like, but it was once a place of frenzied dancing and sacrificial offerings to Kambadlan, the Black Tortoise of Night. I must admit I laughed at this, but after I was shown the temple and the burnt bones still on its altar, my mirth left me hurriedly.

This is the origin of the sel-dom-heard Waterdhavian oaths: "By the Black Tortoise!" and "By the shell of Kambadlan!" The cult is now extinct-I believe. Yet something of its dark and dangerous mystery still clings to this old place-or perhaps some other plots lurk here?

Proprietor: The tall but stout proprietor of the Raging Lion, Lhaerhlin Masram, is impassivefaced but affable.
