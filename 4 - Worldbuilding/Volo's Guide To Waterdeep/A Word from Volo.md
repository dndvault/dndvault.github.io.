# A Word from Volo

his guidebook is the result of extensive, often hazardous explorations of the City of Splendors, most colorful city of the Sword Coast. It is the dream of many folk across Faerun to someday visit this fabled, bustling marketplace and grandest of abodes. This tome attempts to steer visitors to sights and folk they want to see-or avoid.

No one traveler can go everywhere and see all in Waterdeep, and with passing time, somethings I have written will change.

With a few exceptions, I couldn't enter the villas and walled homes of the nobles without invitation, so they do not appear herein (and for obvious reasons, I dare not write of my few covert glimpses of their splendors-ladies, I'll not forget).

If you visit a guildhall in Waterdeep and are not a member, you are typically shown (as I was) into a small number of meeting rooms, and are not free to wander. Watching, attentive guards deter prying, and the result is a boring visit unless you have business with the guild. Guild members would not look favorably on my giving away secrets, either, and so I avoid describing guild buildings. For the same reason, temples, shrines,  
and other places restricted to those of one faith aren't explored in these pages.

My forays into the City of the Dead, the sewers, and various City fortresses were also severely limited, and their coverage here reflects that. I believe only a longtime citizen of Waterdeepwhich I'm not-should attempt a guide to the pleasant parkland that houses the city's legions of dead.

Anyone drawing near any gate of the city can see Mount Water-deep-and that's as close as most of us are ever going to get. Everyone goes to gawk at Castle Waterdeep and at Piergeiron's Palace (again, seeing little indeed of their inside, except by invitation of the Lords), so I've largely left those out, too.

A traveler could spend a lifetime in Waterdeep and not fully sample its every nuance, pleasure, back alley or experience. There must be many noteworthy places I've missed. Those omissions aside, I think you'll agree this is the best guidebook to Waterdeep available. I urge you all to remember with favor the name of:
