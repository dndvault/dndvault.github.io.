# Sea Ward

![img-38.jpeg](assets/Volo's%20Guide%20To%20Waterdeep_img-38.jpeg)  
ea Ward is the wealthiest ward of the city. This district lies north of Julthoon Street and west of Shield Street, with a small eastern arm extending to the High Road along Vondil Street. Lashed by sea storms, it is almost deserted in winter, but in warmer months is home to most of Waterdeep's noble families, who play here with as much gusto as they do on their own estates.

The major avenue of this ward is the Street of the Singing Dolphin. The ward is notable not only for the many-spired and grand homes of the nobles, ${ }^{1}$ but for containing the majority of the city's temples, which soar every bit as grand and haughty as the nobles' homes. Other notable landmarks include the Field of Triumph (a vast open stadium), the lush Heroes' Gardens (Waterdeep's only public parkland outside the City of the Dead), and West Gate, which leads onto the beaches where folk of strong hearts and tough skins brave the chilly waters whenever winter ice sculptures don't block access to the waves of the Sea of

Swords. Be sure to see the Lion Gate, the impressive carved entrance to the Field of Triumph, facing Gulzindar Street.

Also in this ward are the towers and works of many powerful wizards. Folk of importance who want to build opulent homes come here. Those with less snobbery and more lust or need for everyday power can be found in Castle Ward. Those with less money or less need to impress can be found in North Ward.

Truth to tell, except for the fading smell of the sea and lack of temples as one goes east, the visitor can see little difference between North Ward and Sea Ward. Nonetheless, the visitor should remember that the most pushy of Waterdeeps wealthier merchants crowd into the best addresses they can find in this ward. Some Waterdhavians devote their entire lives to attaining a Sea Ward address. Though citizens may joke about this social climbing, the visitor would do well to avoid talking on such sensitive things.

Watch patrols are very frequent. However, they are always polite and generally lightly armed? Street violence, theft, and

[^0]: ${ }^{1}$ One correction for the maps in both FR1 Waterdeep and the North and the City System boxed set: the Tesper noble family is shown as owning two villas, \#87 and \#89. The more southerly villa, \#87, is actually the seat of the Eagleshield noble family, who, Elminster says, appreciate our help in restoring their rightful recognition. Its floor plan, still mistakenly attributed to the wrong family, appears on Map 4 of the City System boxed set.

vandalism of any sort is not tolerated in this ward. Unless welldressed or a known Waterdhavian noble, and drunk, those who engage in such things are quickly handled by the city watch.

### La NOMARKs

Many visitors to the city if they can find good weather and time enough, go for a stroll in Sea Ward just to gawk at the griffons  
and other steeds being flown overhead, the proud architecture all around, and the wasteful display of wealth everywhere. The walk is apt to be thirsty There are very few taverns in this ward. Inns stand thin on the ground here, too-and there are no guildhalls at all.

In evening, the setting sun blazes on many gilded domes and spires here. More ornamental things such as minarets, bell

[^0]: ${ }^{2}$ City watch patrols are detailed on page 17 of Waterdeep and the North. In this ward, four-sword patrols pass a given point about every 10 minutes and look in to a tavern or inn dining room every 30 minutes.

    As detailed on pages 16-17 and 23 of the City System set booklet, six-man detachments of the city guard also patrol the ward. Typical patrol details are as given therein, on page 23. Reinforcements will be a dozen LG hm F3s to F6s clad in chain mail and armed with maces, long swords, daggers, slings, and a polearm. Guard patrols pass a given street location about every 30 minutes, but appear 1d4 minutes after a city watch patrol blows a warning horn in this ward.

arches, and statuary crowd this ward than other areas of the city.

As in North Ward, most nobles' homes are behind walls, but most of the walled temple complexes welcome visitors-even those of other faiths, so long as they offer no blasphemy and make offerings to the gods. The largest temple is the House of Heroes, dedicated to Tempus. It stands just north of the Field of Triumph stadium, and is rivaled in size by the Tower of Luck, the temple of Tymora. In Waterdeep, these two vie with the Spires of the Morning-the temple to Lathander located in Castle Ward just south of the stadium-  
and with the up-and-coming temple to Gond, the House of Inspired Hands.

The faith of Selune has always been important in the port city of Waterdeep, and the House of the Moon can be found off Diamond Street in Sea Ward. The city's wealth is demonstrated by its support for a walled and forested shrine to Silvanus and two mighty temples that could not flourish in smaller centers: the House of Wonder, dedicated to Midnight (formerly to Mystra), and the Temple of Beauty given to the worship of Sune. ${ }^{3}$

the wizards' towers that rise in this ward: the Dragon Tower of Maaril, about which so many sinister tales are whispered; Naingate, abode of the famous adventuring mage Nain, once of the Company of Crazed Venturers; and Tessalar's Tower. ${ }^{4}$

There is also a strange sort of obstacle course, established by a crazed wizard to test the greedy the venturesome, and others who wander into it. Known as the Blue Alley, this magical death trap is entered by either one of two blue-tiled passages that run into a large, windowless stone building on the north side of Ivory Street, just east of its meeting with Sighing Maidens' Walk. Vast treasure is said to wait there for any who can take it, but from what I heard, the place is studded with inescapable traps that claim almost all who enter, like those found in the wilder tales of dungeon exploration. Look down the alley as I did - but be very sure of your favor with the gods before you step farther.

[^0]: ${ }^{4}$ On the color map, the Dragon Tower is \#63, Naingate is \#73,andTessalar's Tower is \#95. Chapter 7 of that work also details the three mages who own these homes and some of the strange magical features of the Dragon Tower can be found in the Knight of the Living Dead adventure gamebook.

    Maaril has turned to evil, and his tower, sculpted in the shape of a rampant dragon, is a place that citizens of Waterdeep warn visitors away from. They say its steps lead up to chambers and winding stairs adorned with many trapped, enchanted creatures set as guardians and in torment. The steps also lead down to cellars where there are magical pools that speak and whose waters confer magical powers on those touching them-or dissolve flesh, bone, metal, and all in a moment of smoke!

    The wraiths of Maaril's young female apprentices, their lives drained by his evil magic, wander the tower, attacking intruders. Everywhere lurks a webwork of Maaril's waiting, terrible spells. The unwitting can trigger their own doom with a single wrong step.

    Maaril is said to ride dragons, to call them from the dragon's mouth balcony at the top of the towerand to experiment with hatchlings, creating fearsome dragonet monsters.

    Elminster confirmed that these things are true, but added dryly that, "It's just a stage he's going through. Know ye: Maaril will either grow up or be destroyed by the things he's playing with. If ye run afoul of him, thy best defense is that he's only about a tenth as powerful or as smart as he thinks he is."

### Tespergates

The Waterdhavian noble family of Tesper uses its walled city villa ${ }^{5}$ to host parties-parties even common folk and outlanders are welcome to attend. The Tespers have an almost insatiable hunger for live music and the willing company of strangers who enjoy wrestling and other body contact sports. They host one all-night gathering every tenday. Rousing ball games and impromptu wrestling tournaments abound, with not a few bumps and bruises to the participants. To make sure that no one goes away in bad spirits, a 5 gp purse is presented to the best player.

The food tends to be simple roast fowl, usually - but the ale and zzar flow freely. The only reason the common folk don't crowd into the villa until a guest couldn't breathe, let alone take a step in any direction, is that Tespergates is-haunted.

This keeps most Waterdhavians away. Everyone in the city has heard the tragic tale of the Tesper sisters, Silpara and Yulhymbra, who grew up playing with elven friends and proved to have a mastery of magic. Unfortunately their family hated and feared magic at the time (this  
![img-42.jpeg](assets/Volo's%20Guide%20To%20Waterdeep_img-42.jpeg)  
occurred four generations ago). When this was revealed, they were ostracized, and the two sisters were soon slain by assassins sent by a younger brother, who feared they might use their Art to rule the family.

Their ghosts still haunt the house, drifting about its chambers and passages as silent but seemingly intelligent phantoms. If angered, they cast spells that create spectacular images and sounds, but do nothing more than attract attention. They are now considered to be both amusing party entertainment and a sort of household warning system, alerting the family to thieves, vandals, and crimes done in their halls. ${ }^{6}$

[^0]: ${ }^{5}$ The villa is \#89 on the color map and the City System map. Map location \#87, mistakenly labeled as a Tesper villa, is actually that of the Eagleshield noble family.  
    ${ }^{6}$ Elminster reveals that a Harper mage, Nleera Tarannath, has been impersonating one of the ghosts for a year or so. This gives her a chance to pass on messages to Harpers at the parties-messages adventurers might well overhear and get drawn into an adventure. The ghosts seem to tolerate and even aid Nleera in her imposture.
