# Southern Ward

![img-109.jpeg](assets/Volo's%20Guide%20To%20Waterdeep_img-109.jpeg)  
any of the common folk of Waterdeep dwell in Southern Ward. This homely, friendly, busy and largely poor area is the forgotten ward of Waterdeep. It is sometimes referred to as Caravan City after its major activity. In it warehouses, stables, and coach sheds stand in plenty to serve the bustle of overland trade in and out of Waterdeep. Be warned: Native Waterdhavians call it just South Ward. Anyone using the longer term is marked instantly as an outsider.

There's little of interest for the casual stroller to see, and the security of trade goods dictates both the presence of guards and their reluctance to let visitors gawk at what's inside warehouses or wagons. ${ }^{1}$ Still, South Ward does have landmarks, and some hidden pleasures, too.

### Landmarks

This is the first part of the city seen by most travelers entering it  
overland from the south. One of the city's smallest wards and probably its least socially and politically important and influential one, South Ward is the ordinary side of Waterdeep.

From Southgate onwards, the broad street known as the Way of the Dragon forms the southern and western boundaries of South Ward. The High Road, the closest thing Waterdeep has to a main street, bisects it.

South Ward's eastern boundary is the Trollwall. Its ragged northern boundary consists of Telshambra's Street, a little bit of the High Road, Sahtyra's Lane, Caravan Court (all of which is deemed to be in South Ward), and Belzer's Walk. Some call Belzer's Walk simply Belzer's, but locals sharply correct those who do.

South Ward is dominated by large, tall, old stone, mud brick, and timber warehouses. Crowded among them are threeand four-floor-high tenements, most with shops at street level. Trees and even bushes are few, dust (or mud) is plentiful, but everything

[^0]
[^0]: ${ }^{1}$ The private guards at every establishment (typically a dozen or so LN F1s and F2s) can call on the law, who will come running at any sound of shouting or clanging metal, such as a guard beating his blade on his shield. All the guards know this.

    City watch patrols are detailed on page 17 of FR1 Waterdeep and the North. They pass a given point about every 20 minutes and look into a tavern or inn dining room about every 40 minutes.

    As detailed on pages 20 and 23 of the City System boxed set booklet, the city guard also patrols South Ward in six-man detachments. Typical patrol details are as given on page 23. Reinforcements will be a dozen LG hm F3s to F6s clad in chain mail and armed with maces, long swords, daggers, slings, and a pole arm appropriate to the locale. Guard patrols pass a given street location about every hour in South Ward, and arrive 2 d 8 minutes after a city watch patrol blows a warning horn.

else is kept clean, and the streets are always busy. The predominant sound in South Ward is the rumble of cart wheels. The smell of this part of the city is not of fish from the harbor, but is provided by the dung of the draft animals. Most of the stables are merely covered pens, although sometimes a multifloored building provides the cover.

The best-known places in the Ward are Caravan Court; Brian the Swordmaster's smithy and shop; the house of the kindly  
wizard Kappiyan Flurmastyr; ${ }^{3}$ Metalmasters' Hall, ${ }^{4}$ headquarters of the Most Careful Order of Skilled Smiths \& Metalforgers; the House of Good Spirits, headquarters of the Vintners', Distillers', and Brewers' Guild; the magnificent, gargoyle-adorned edifice of the Stone House ${ }^{6}$ of the Carpenters', Roofers', and Plaisterers' Guild (or, as I heard one merchant call it, "that great pile"); and the Jade Dancer ${ }^{7}$ tavern and festhall. The House of Good Spirits is also a working inn, and

it can be found from afar by following the strong almond scent of the zzar made there. Locals also use the lesser known taverns as landmarks, along with the other guildhalls in the ward: the Coach \& Wagon Hall, ${ }^{8}$ headquarters of the Wagonmakers' and Coach Builders' Guild; Saddlers' and Harness-Makers' Hall $^{9}$ of the guild of the same name; Builders' Hall ${ }^{10}$ of the Guild of Stonecutters and Masons; and the Road House, ${ }^{11}$ headquarters of the Fellowship  
of Carters and Coachmen.  
I found that the most interesting places in South Ward were hidden away or that most visitors and Waterdhavians alike pass them by. One was the Moon Sphere, a magical sphere of blue radiance that appears in Dancing Court only when the moon is full and allows any folk inside of it to fly or dance on air. Another was the Old Monster Shop, which fronts on the Jar, and sells monsters for the hungry the bored, and the vengeful.

### Kappiyan <br> F1urmasTYr's House

The unassuming house of the wizard Kappiyan Flurmastyr is a popular destination in South Ward. Many folk wanting potions find their ways to Kappiyan's house. ${ }^{12}$ The house sits at the northern entrance to Anchoret's Court and has easy access to the safe drinking water well there.

An arched wooden door with a brass strike-gong and a brass nameplate that says "Kappiyan" leads into a small, neat, richly appointed two-story building. Fine furniture, rugs, and vivid, skillfully painted landscapes crowd a cozy home. Save for the homonculous that answers the door and the stone golem hung with cloaks and hats in the entry hall, the ground floor looks like the abode of any well-off, unpretentious merchant or widow.

On the upper floor, however, you'll find a large spellcasting  
chamber at the head of the stairs, three bedrooms (one for Kappiyan, one for an apprentice, and one for guests), a wardrobe room, a bathroom, and a spellbooklined study lit by a tall brass brazier with a cast snake coiling up its standard. The rooms are richly paneled in polished wood, and all of the large, oval beds levitate, floating silently at whatever height anyone touching them wills them to be at.

Kappiyan's current apprentice told me there are guardian creatures and magic-especially flying wands that Kappiyan can trigger from afar-all over the house, but the only wand I saw was hidden behind a secret panel in the wall of the wardrobe. If you rap three times ${ }^{13}$ on a certain panel there, it drops open to reveal a cached, silvery wand ${ }^{14}$ for use in emergencies. These are fortunately few. Those living near told me Kappiyan is a quiet, kindly neighbor.

An expert maker of potion ${ }^{15}$ who testily insists he is not

[^0]
[^0]: ${ }^{12}$ This place is \#218 on the color city map.  
    ${ }^{13}$ In the same round.  
    ${ }^{14}$ Information given in the Knight of the Living Dead gamebook, which contains descriptions of Kappiyan, his abode, and his apprentice Shalara, suggests this is a wand of teleportation. Thrice per day, and at a charge cost of 1 per being per use, the wand can unerringly teleport the wielder and/or any beings touched by the wand or the wielder to any location on the same plane. Unwilling beings cannot avoid this effect, but the wielder must make a successful attack roll to touch them. Multiple beings and nonliving material carried, touched, or within $10^{\prime}$ of the wielder and not in the direct possession of another creature that are willed to accompany the 'ported beings are all brought along. The trip can deliberately be to a midair location, and the wand then confers a feather fall effect on all the things it moves-so the user could 'port to a hostile location, appear above defenders, and cast spells or trigger other items while descending.  
    ${ }^{15}$ Kappiyan's prices tend to be twice the XP value of a potion in gold pieces. Exceptions are the magical drafts that ensure longevity (which he can't make, and has no supply of), allow etherealness and aid in treasure finding (three times their XP value), any potions of control (eight times their XP value), and healing or curative potions of any sort (which he gives out for half their XP value).

running a potion shop, Kappiyan is too kind-hearted to turn the world away and so is always selling potions to folk who turn up at his door. The proceeds fund his researches. Kappiyan is a refiner of small and elegant magics, not a wizard bent on ruling the world. He is kind and easily moved, and is always helping hard-luck cases. Those who are cruel or who use magic to govern others make him very angry. He has been known to appear without warning and use his own magic to deliver sharp lessons to such folk. ${ }^{16}$

Kappiyan's kindness and soft heart have led him to help many eager students of the Art. Over the years, he has aided a long succession of maidens in becoming sorceresses. ${ }^{17}$ His current apprentice is Shalara, a friendly lass born to merchants in Amphail.

Kappiyan looks like most folk  
![img-112.jpeg](assets/Volo's%20Guide%20To%20Waterdeep_img-112.jpeg)  
think a good wizard should. He's tall, thin, white-bearded, and always clad in dark robes covered with runes and symbols.

[^0]
[^0]: ${ }^{16}$ Kappiyan is further detailed on page 53 of FR1 Waterdeep and the North. His staff is a staff of power. He is $86 \%$ likely to correctly identify any standard (that is, ones that are found in the DUNGEON MASTER ${ }^{\mathrm{TM}}$ Guide) potion that hasn't been doctored or mixed with something else. He can always tell when two or more potions have been mixed together, but not necessarily what the potions were.

    Most of Kappiyan's enchanted gems have effects identical to rings of protection and potions of vitality. One commonly crafted sort requires a ruby, emerald, or black opal. It heals 4-16 points of damage/day, operating by itself with a visible flash and glow when its bearer is injured. Roll 4d4 when it first activates. If the total is higher than the hit points lost, the remainder waits for another activation, later in the day but is lost if it doesn't occur within 24 hours or 144 turns.

    Kappiyan also makes periapts of health, periapts of proof against poison, and greenstone amulets (detailed in FR4 The Magister and many other Realms sources).  
    ${ }^{17}$ Even Elminster was envious of the roster of apprentices Kappiyan had accumulated over the years. He's so kindly that young lasses trust him completely (and rightly). He has aided the following sorceresses of note, among many others, to become accomplished wielders of the Art:

    - Cathliira of Elturel (CN hf W9)  
    -Ilphara of Amnwater (NG hf W10)  
    -Imbaerl of Baldur's Gate (CG hf W12)  
    -Larithmae of Almraiven (CG hf W12)  
    -Minthalue of Suzail (CN hf W9). When she came to Kappiyan, she was a famous Calishite exotic dancer. Tongues wagged furiously all over Waterdeep for over a year.  
    -Nesmorae of Callidyrr (CG hf W11)  
    -Phantrara of Priapurl (NG hf W8)

He's going bald, looks very distinguished, and always carries a staff. He can identify many potions by look and smell alone, and is especially skilled at turning gems into magical items that protect or aid their bearers.

Kappiyan lives with Shalara, who is perhaps 16 years old. She has dark hair and eyes, and is earnest and easily upset. She prefers to and wears pants and tunics, as do boys her age, for greater freedom of motion.

Spell battles in and around Kappiyan's house may be disappointingly few (to tourists, not  
neighbors), but this was not always so. Eighty years ago, one of Waterdeep's first nightclubs stood on this site. It was known as the Rusty Halidom and was destroyed one night in a magic fight between drunken wizards, who blew it apart with all the guests, wine kegs, and dancers still inside. There are still rumors of buried treasure being lost in the wreckage and paved over now in the alleyway outside the house. Shalara doubts such tales.

It is in the streets around Kappiyan's house that the Ghost Knight is most often seen?
