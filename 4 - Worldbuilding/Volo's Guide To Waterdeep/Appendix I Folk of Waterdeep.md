![img-166.jpeg](assets/Volo's%20Guide%20To%20Waterdeep_img-166.jpeg)  
s has been said before, the people of Waterdeep are Waterdeep. No guide to the city is complete without a mention of the more colorful and influential folk who live there and shape Waterdeep into what the city is.

With Elminster's help, we've included a "best guesses" list here of the probable classes, levels, and alignments of some of the Waterdhavians Volo mentions. Adventurers be warned: Much of what is said here may be wrong!

This list is alphabetical by first name (or only known alias) because so many citizens of Waterdeep lack surnames. Only ability scores of 16 or greater are listed, and the standard Realms character statistic abbreviations are used.

She has a perfect memory and makes a point of learning the names and details that guests want to give her, so that she can take an interest in their doings and make them feel important on their next visit. This ability has made her very useful to the city watch on many occasions. Although her profit margin is small, she grows steadily wealthier, as word of mouth makes the Jug a more popular place, despite its prices, year after year.
