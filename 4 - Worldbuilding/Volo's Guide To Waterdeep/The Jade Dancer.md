# The Jade Dancer

Tavern \& Festhall

### 䍐䍐䍐 0000

This raucous haunt of the young, free, and ardently romantic opens onto Dancing Court, sometime site of the eerily beautiful Moon Sphere, just north of Slop Street in the Tween Run (the local name for the alleys and buildings between the High Road and the Way of the Dragon). ${ }^{37}$

### The Place

Built of timber and stone columns, its outer walls sealed by a slather-coat of plaster into which mud bricks have been pressed in slanting courses, the Dancer looks like what it is: a warehouse with a grand front tacked on. Its upper floors open onto a broad, two-tier balcony overlooking the Dancing Court, which boasts intricate ornamental wrought iron railings and potted fruit trees. Inside, minstrels play on a hanging gallery suspended from the ceiling on chains above a raised central stage where dancers and singers perform.

The stage and gallery dominate an open central well that soars up to a roof skylight. Interior balconies or promenades of the upper floors open onto the  
well and look down on the stage. Three large, wide-curving circular staircases rise around the well to link the floors. They provide good views of shows, and are often lined with standing patrons.

The kitchens, pantries, and staff quarters are hidden below ground level. The main floor is entirely given over to a bar, a ring-shaped dance area around the stage, and sturdily built, round wooden tables linked by floor-chains to quartets of plain, heavy-duty chairs for patrons.

The upper floors are devoted to large, plant-adorned drinking parlors on the Dancing Court side and festhall rooms (opening off the promenade) around the rest of their extent.

### The Prospect

This clean, brightly lit, noisy place is beloved of young Waterdhavians wanting to be in the rush of new fashion and "in" behavior-and to be seen to be part of it. As most nights pass, the visitor can see and smell the steadily rising excitement. If half the too-loud, excited young boys swaggering around knew how to use the huge weapons they wave about, the nightly slaughter would make Dancing Court run red with gore. ${ }^{38}$

    ${ }^{38}$ The chairs have been thoughtfully chained to the tables. Only an incredibly strong man (ST 18 or greater) can lift and hurl a table and four chairs as one-though many patrons swear they've seen it done.

The Dancer has a staff of expert, good-looking escorts who mingle with the patrons. Misguessing who is a patron and who is an escort has left many a visitor to the city with a face red and ringing from a hard slap. A hint: You can recognize an escort by the room keys worn around their necks on fine chains.

The rooms are not all for the use of escorts. Couples who find each other among the drinks can rent rooms. Those thinking of  
taking liberties with escorts or guests are hereby warned that the Jade Dancer also has as a bouncer a watchful wizard, Selcharoon Nrim, who wears a ring of invisibility and a ring of jumping, and ably wields a wand of paralyzation.

The establishment is named for its star dancing attraction: Jade, a magically animated, incredibly beautiful, life-sized jade statue, fashioned like a human female. ${ }^{39}$ Usually found

[^0]
[^0]: ${ }^{39}$ Elminster reveals that Jade is a special sort of figurine of wondrous power, mentally animated by the owner of the club, the sorceress Cathalishaera. It will crumble into dust if taken more than 200 paces from Cathalishaera or if Cathalishaera should die. She customarily keeps it in a Leomund's secret chest, and the tiny half of this item is carried on her person, avoiding the destructive effects of moving the statue too far away.

    The sorceress customarily sits in a locked, hidden room during performances, seeing through the statue's eyes and moving it by will in response to the music and the calls of the crowd. She loves this work, but is too shy to ever dare dance in person.

dancing on the stage in acrobatic poses no human dancer with any dignity or nerve endings could endure for long, it begins an evening with no hair but grows illusory flowing hair as it moves - until a floor-length train of tresses flows behind and around it. The hair then vanishes, to begin growing again. The cycle takes about an hour.

### The ProvenJer

A wild variety of drinkables can be had here, from glowing amber dwarven thorl beldarakul (Old Trickster) to cool, minty green shondath icewine, favored by some elves and halflings. Among humans, Al \& Tal's Slurp Syrup (well-spiked cherry syrup) is popular, along with Fool's Thirst-Quencher (a mix of six beers and winter wine), and, of course, zzar, which can be had at double strength. All drinks here are 5 sp for a handglass and 1 gp for a tall flagon.

To go with the drinkables, the Dancer staff serves free bowls of salted nuts, loaves of hot garlicbuttered bread ( $2 \mathrm{sp} /$ round loaf), and skewered roast fowl two to a skewer for $3 \mathrm{sp} /$ skewer. These are small plucked chickens with head, feet, and organs removed, cooked over an open fire.

### The People

The proprietress of the Dancer is the seldom-seen sorceress Catha-  
lishaera, who relies on her bouncer Selcharoon and her staff of about 20 female and 12 male escorts, about half of whom are on shift on a given night, and the house staff of 10 bar and kitchen workers.

The best-known of the house staff is the fat, talkative, wisecracking lady bartender, Khalou Mazestar. She loves to talk to guests at the bar and is a great source of jokes, information on current fads and interests among the swinging young of Waterdeep, and gossip about who's involved with whom among Waterdeep's noble and monied families. She's especially envious of those people who can afford to festoon themselves with precious jewels, and never tires of hearing or passing on news of Lady Shanderplast's navel carbuncle or Lord Lunkoon's huge emerald earplugs.

### The Prices

Aside from the bar prices already given, the Dancer charges 2 cp per glass or flagon thrown or broken, and 1 sp per plant eaten or destroyed, and 1 gp per piece of furniture set afire or destroyed. An hour's use of a room key runs 1 gp , with a maximum of 10 gp for use of the room the whole night.

Escorts charge 6 to 12 gp per visit to a room. No extra room charges apply, but the rate covers half an hour or less of the escort's

time. Those who want company for longer must pay multiple charges.

### Travelers' Lore

Tales connected to the Dancer either have to do with love, legendary drinking bouts, or the Moon Sphere out front. The musicians hired to play here are very good. Come early for a good seat and the least amount of drunken drink-hurling at performers. Bards known up and  
down the Sword coast sometimes perform from the hanging gallery. Once, a few winters back, a sylph sang hauntingly mournful love calls and reduced the whole place to tears.

There are persistent whispers about the Jade Dancer being a transformed, trapped human female-perhaps a princess or noble lady. There are also tales of her occasionally taking a male patron up to one of the rooms and that the men were never seen again. ${ }^{40}$

[^0]
[^0]: ${ }^{40}$ The tales about the Jade Dancer being a trapped or transformed human are false. So is any reference to "her" enjoying the company of a human man. Elminster says tales of the Jade Dancer leading men to the rooms are probably true. Cathalishaera used to use this method to remove troublemakers or the hopelessly drunk or to get shy men and women together, but it has become too attention-getting, and she no longer does it. Between shows, the Jade Dancer vanishes down through the kitchens and into an air shaft (disused chimney) leading to the upper floors, where she's unlikely to be found by a would-be thief. As disassembled jade, the figurine's body is worth about $9,000 \mathrm{gp}$.

### Aurora's Realms Shop Catalogue Counter

This is the South Ward outlet of Aurora's. Located next to the Red Gauntlet tavern in a crumbling tenement, this shop fronts on the Way of the Dragon. It has four guards, who work in shifts of two and two, a pretty half-elven counter clerk named Mril Juthbuck (an odd name for an elfJuthbuck is usually a halfling surname), and a darkly handsome, arrogant service-mage named Logros Hlandarr.

### Taverns

### The Spouting Fish

![img-127.jpeg](assets/Volo's%20Guide%20To%20Waterdeep_img-127.jpeg)

Large, noisy ("A bit like drinking in the thick of a street brawl," one bravo told me, correctly), and popular, this brightly lit establishment succeeds largely because of its relentless street-crying advertising and its strategic location. Many folk entering the city via Southgate get to its huge, upright, spouting fish water fountain and decide they're thirsty.

Inside its a many-leveled labyrinth of booths, benches, posts, and beams, all unpainted and very flammable. Two hired members of the Watchful Order

### The Red Gauntlet

### 33000

This old, shabbily highbrow place is dimly lit. Its booths are always full of old men remem-  
bering old battles and slightly shady merchants conducting slightly shady deals in low, muttering voices. There's little food to be had beyond fried fish, waybread, and rabbit-and-fowl stew, and little selection (house wines and house ales), but everything is cheap: $3 \mathrm{cp} /$ platter of food and 2 $\mathrm{cp} /$ flagon or tankard. Folk are allowed to drink themselves to sleep here. Those who become noisy or feisty when taken with drink are simply slipped a little sleep syrup in their next drink. Loud snorers are taken to a back room. Others sleep where they sit, watched over against thieves

### The Swords' Rest

### 䍐䍐 0000

This quiet, little-known tavern is the warriors' drinking place, the chosen watering hole of those who swing swords for a living. It is a good place to hire out-ofwork fighting men. This tavern has strong ale, zzar, and exotic drinks from the far corners of  
the Realms, and there's always a whole ox, boar, or deer-or all three-turning on a spit, so hearty meals ( $1 \mathrm{sp} /$ platter) can be had at any time. Open from highsun (noon) to dawn, daily.

Proprietor: The proprietor, Beliarge "Old Boar" Maduskar, is called Bel by his friends. ${ }^{45}$

### The Full Cup

One of the seediest drinking holes in Waterdeep, this battered place is used by bad-tempered drovers and carters. Most are too exhausted to fight when they get

here, which is for the best. It's a small, dim place dominated by a long bar with stools and an impressive, but largely dustcovered, selection of bottles behind it. There's almost always a pile of the remnants of smashed furniture outside the front door.

The Full Cup is notable for three things: the brawls that occur here with distressing regularity the truly incredible cold winter drafts that send icy fingers stabbing into every corner of the place, and the bowls of hot buttered mushrooms ( $1 \mathrm{cp} /$ large wooden bowl) grown in the taverns own dung cellars. The dung is largely from  
the horses and oxen that crowd the streets around, and lies several feet deep in the noisome cellar.

Those who know how to discreetly ask the proprietor (and pay about $5 \mathrm{gp} /$ item) can have items hidden under the dung for a month or less. After that, the hider forfeits the item. Be warned that the city watch searches here regularly for stolen items and the like and once found a buried skeleton with a dagger in its ribs. Patrons merely grunted as the bones were being carried out, "Errh. Someone who didn't pay up."

### AlLeys

South Ward's alleys can be just as dangerous as neighboring Dock Wards-especially for lone walkers late at night. Lantern parties tend to be a half-dozen strong or more. If you carry a light, you draw thieves, thugs, and the like to you-of course, if you don't, you can't see them coming!

Only the most interesting of these back ways appear here. For your own safety see them by daylight.

### Blacklock Alley

### 5

This long, narrow way runs parallel to the Way of the Dragon south of Brian's Street in the Tween Run area. It is named for the Blacklock, a waist-high stone obelisk about halfway down its length. The Blacklock has a hole worn in it, and youths play games that involve hurling a coconut or rag-and-rock ball through the hole to score points. Local lore says that anyone pure in heart who puts part of their body such as an arm or leg, through the hole will be healed. ${ }^{47}$

![img-133.jpeg](assets/Volo's%20Guide%20To%20Waterdeep_img-133.jpeg)

Gangs and sneak-thieves roam this alley. Anyone trying to remove, chip pieces from, or cast spells at the Blacklock will be attacked by a general rising of the neighborhood, all of whom believe the Blacklock brings them luck and wards off any tanar'ri that may roam near.

### The Forcebar

This short, well-traveled passage is named for its intended defensive use. In the event that Waterdeep is invaded, huge sections of  
stone wall can be magically brought from the ethereal plane to block major roads in the city at strategic points, forming an inner ring of defensible walls. Just south of this alleyway one such wall will block the High Road-and the Forcebar, along with Tilman's Lane, will form a route for defenders along the inside of this wall.

Although at least one gang has used the Forcebar to crash caravan wagons on the High Road by spurring fast carts out of it into contact with them and then launching a sudden and

well-armed attack on the goods and wagon crew this passage is heavily used by both the city guard and the city watch, and so is fairly safe.

### Ilisar's Alley

$\int$  
This alley runs south from Telshambra's Street only to loop around and rejoin it again. Sometimes miscalled Illimar's Alley this street is named for a famous local tailor who grew very rich. When he died of blacktongue fever, the bulk of his wealth was never found. Some think it's buried or walled up in one of the buildings here, because he owned the whole block.

Before Ilisar's time, this back route had a grimmer name: Grave Alley In the days before the wizard Anacaster established gatetombs in the City of the Dead, citizens of Waterdeep too poor to afford a crypt or to have a country villa to be buried at were interred here. Coffins were put in vertically under each flagstone. The eruptions of undead this caused forced abandonment of this practice very  
long ago-but locals whisper that sometimes wights, ghouls, zombies, and skeletons come up from the depths of the earth here!

### Mouse Alley

$\int$  
This very short, curving run links Blacklock Alley to Brian's Street, just west of Fishwife Alley It is named for a famous mouse that ran along it in front of the wizard Ahghairon and turned out to be, as he suspected, a shapeshifted sorceress of great power-the goddess Mystra, in fact! It is today the haunt of one of Waterdeep's best-if that's the proper term-informants and eavesdroppers: Ruufdeidel "Roove" Ressatar, a short, imp-like little man who is perpetually smiling and has a talent for hiding, moving silently and passing unnoticed. He can usually be found here lounging against a wall awaiting hire. ${ }^{48}$

The alley is said to be sacred to Mystra. Here she aids those faithful to her and punishes any who would harm her faithful taking refuge here. ${ }^{49}$

Of old, the wizard Thunturn,

[^0]
[^0]: ${ }^{48}$ Roove's prices vary with the danger of the snooping task set him, rising from a base of $2 \mathrm{gp} /$ day. For this, he agrees to meet with the client at least once a day at a place mutually agreed upon, but will never accept any work that involves him doing anything more active than leaving a message or sign. He's strictly an eavesdropper, not a thief, go-between, or assassin. He will always have concealed, hired allies present at such meetings to prevent an employer double-crossing him. His allies are mimics and dopplegangers!  
    ${ }^{49}$ Any wizard who worships Mystra (or Midnight) fleeing into this alleyway will be instantly rendered invisible, and have any spells they cast since the last time they studied restored to them. In addition, they regain 1 hit point (if they have lost any), and will suddenly realize that they can dimension door out of the alleyway, if they wish. This benefit is lost if they leave the alleyway by other means.

whose hair was white with age, came here in his pride and power to challenge Mystra for mastery of all magic-and she sent him away humble, stripped of all Art, his hair turned jet black from the fright of confronting Her.

### Rednose Alley

### D

This alley runs due west from Tezambril Street, just south of its junction with Robin's Way. The disused warehouses that line it house gangs of homeless youths, drifters who have come to Waterdeep seeking fortune and  
come up empty-handed, and fugitives from the law. They fight each other often, driven by hunger and boredom-and leap at the chance to attack or rob anyone who passes this way who looks weak enough for a halfdozen or so of them to overcome. The alley's name comes from the many bloody noses they incur fighting with each other when they put away their daggers to avoid swift deaths.

### Ruid's Stroll

### $\checkmark$

This short, curving passage links Caravan Court with the nearest

---

Trollwall Tower (the one east of the Redbridle Stables) and is fairly safe thanks to the heavy use by the city guard and the watch. It is named for the ghost of a long-dead mage who appears on foggy nights, walking silently down it with his staff in hand and the cowl of his dark robes drawn over his head. He appears at the Court end in swirling mists and fades away again as he reaches the wall tower.

The ghost never reacts to living beings, but it is said anyone who touches or passes through it  
is shaken by a terrible chill, ${ }^{50}$ but thereafter learns a truth.

### Sethma's Court

Named for an old wise woman who dwelt here until her death some 30 winters ago, this cobbled courtyard is a gathering place for all sorts of birds flying over the city. They drink water from the roof cisterns all around it. No one knows why this place almost magnetically attracts them so.

[^0]: ${ }^{50}$ Contact with this strange phantom, which cannot be turned or dispelled, causes a loss of $1 \mathrm{~d} 4+1 \mathrm{hp}$ which can be regained by normal healing means. By means of a note, the DM should inform the player of a character contacting the phantom that they will receive one true, full answer on something they formally request the truth about during future play. This boon works only once per character-but the hit point loss will happen each time the character contacts Ruid's phantom.
