North Ward's alleys are by far the safest of any ward of Waterdeep. Children have been known to safely play unattended in them on bright moonlit nights. Lantern guides tend to be lone men or youths and sometimes even maids, and the alleys have a reputation more as a place for drunks to snore away the night undisturbed, than places to be avoided due to danger.

### Black Dog Alley

This short way circles around the interior of a block of buildings  
due south of Farwatch Tower, linking up with Watch Alley. It is named for the silent phantom of a black dog that is seen padding steadily along here on many nights. The hound wears a spiked hunting or war collar, stands as tall a goat, and has blazing red eyes. It looks at no one directly and simply walks through people and objects alike.

### Catchthief Alley

This short, narrow passage runs north off Golden Serpent Street, along the east wall of the Helmfast noble family villa com-

pound. ${ }^{32}$ Its name comes from its site as the downfall of the infamous thief Uluryk Malogh, who was slain by a hail of poisoned arrows here many winters ago after he killed the heads of two noble houses in a tavern brawl and taunted their kin by revealing himself as an agent of the banished Thieves Guild, who had been ordered to bring about their doom.

He escaped into the sewers and cellars of the city which he knew as few others do, but the Guild thought him insane and a risk to themselves, and sent agents into the city to slay him. The agents of the Guild caught him in this alley. Some folk swear they have heard the ghostly bubbling whisper of his last words, pronouncing a curse on all traitors, and lamenting that the poison burns so.

There are persistent rumors that he made an extensive map of the cellars and sewers, detailing traps, barriers, and locks. If it exists, it has never come to light.

The alley is also notable for the fact that much of it was once destroyed by a wyrm bursting up from below! There is an old legend in the city of a dozen or more dragonets that once hatched early and ate their way to freedom, escaping from an importer of dragon eggs into the city sewers. They dined on rats, thieves, and other skulking

[^0]monsters, growing slowly in size and powers. This tale has probably grown a great deal in the telling, but a single dragon undeniably broke out of some cellar, cell, or sewer below the widest part of this alley some 70 winters ago and flew away over the city to escape into the nearby mountains to the north. Its origin, if it was learned at the time, has been forgotten.

### Manycats Alley

This way crosses two city blocks and winds through the interior of a third, running between and for the most part parallel to Julthoon Street and Traders' Way. It passes just to the south of the Adarbrent noble family villa, ${ }^{33}$ and is notable not only for the many cats that roam it (for which it is named), dining on leavings from several butcher shops located along its run, but also for the many carved stone heads that adorn buildings along the alley.

The carved heads are of both sexes and many races and are very lifelike-leading some fanciful folk to claim they are petrified, severed heads of onceliving beings. Whatever their origin, it is widely believed in the city that the heads speak aloud from time to time, uttering cryptic messages.

### Shattercrock Alley

This short alleyway circles south from Stabbed Sailor Alley only to meet with it again, encircling the Margaster noble family villa. ${ }^{34}$ It is named for a famous incident, many summers ago, when a wizard-Phantamos of the Purple Cloak, who went on to become mighty in Art, a legend across the North-was learning to fly by means of magic and swooped wildly through a huge cart of crockery being pushed along this alley to make delivery to a shop here. For many years a tavern, the

Wizard with Wings, backed onto this alley fronting on Suldoun Street, but it burned down of suspicious causes a decade ago. A fine shop offering spectacular hats, wigs, and body-manes to ladies stands on the site now.

### Stabbed Sailor Alley

This alleyway links Vhezoar Street with Whaelgond Way. At its midpoint stands a clump of magnificent shadowtop trees of great age and height (some $90^{\prime}$ ), that shade the streets around and provide a home to nesting birds.

This alley links with Shattercrock Alley and is linked to the Street of the Manticore to the north by a tiny alleyway known as Sprangalar's Swordcut.

The Swordcut and Stabbed Sailor got their names in the aftermath of a bloody street fight, years back, when citizens fought with followers of the Cult of the Dancing Bear and either destroyed it or drove it underground. ${ }^{35}$ The alleyway is a busy but safe delivery route today. Its shade makes it a favorite stroll on hot, sunny days.

### Trollskull Alley

A narrow, little-known passage winding through the interior of a city block just north of, and parallel to, the eastern end of Delzorin Street, this alley's deadend is a favorite night haunt of  
gambling gangs - bored, wealthy youths who waste their money on dares and games of chance. By day it is safe and crowded with carts of garbage and delivered goods for the businesses that back onto it. By night, it is the turf of aggressive youths of both sexes - who often pelt the city watch with stones.

### Watch Alley

A short passage that runs due south from Farwatch Tower before looping back to meet itself, this lane serves as an assembly point for city watch patrols and a quick route south for themhence its name. It is as safe as an alley can be, except for a curious thing, as yet unexplained: From time to time, single, severed, bloody bare human feet are found lying in it. ${ }^{36}$

[^0]: ${ }^{35}$ The Cult of the Dancing Bear was born seven or more generations ago, when Waterdeep celebrated the Festival of Dancing Bears once a year. This barbarian custom preceded the city-the nomadic human tribes of the north simply shifted the place of their annual gathering to Waterdeep.

    During the festival, the barbarians came down to the city with pelts and horns to sell and trinkets, good swords, and much beer to buy. They danced far into the night, and the greatest of their dances was the Dance of the Bear. In this dance, a hunter danced with a captured bear, holding its attention (and claws) by skill and stratagems so it would not menace the crowd around. The hunter wore bear-claw gloves tipped with a drug,and if the bear was scratched deeply enough, it would be affected, falling ever so slowly asleep. Many hunters were killed in this dangerous dance, and Waterdhavian worshippers of Malar took it up after the barbarians stopped coming, dancing with a trained bear or even a man wearing the preserved pelt, claws, and head of a bear.

    The Cult of the Dancing Bear is presently led by Urinborm, who is secretly a specialty priest of Malar, as detailed in the FORGOTTEN REALMS ${ }^{\circledR}$ Adventures hardcover sourcebook, and is a small, under ground faith. Its followers are marked, usually on some part of their body normally hidden by clothing, by the parallel scars of the raking claws of the bear. The faithful meet secretly at least once a month, usually in a cellar somewhere in the city. Rituals involve drinking the blood of animals, dancing with the Bear (Urinborm, in costume), dedicating any hunting activities to the Bear, and mock-fighting fellow cult members with bare hands and teeth until blood is drawn. Cult members are trained in aggressive attacking behavior, and to enjoy a bloodlust. They fiercely avenge any slight or attack on any member of their fellowship, and try to run down in a hunt by night at least one visitor to the city a year.  
    ${ }^{36}$ Elminster says this is an old Thieves Guild punishment, and may herald their return to the city. It comes, he said dryly, from a bad pun about defeating your opponents.
