ome to most of Waterdeep's administrative buildings and buildings of state, this first ward of the city is the heart of power in Waterdeep today. It's also the area most folk who'll tell you of Waterdeep talk about. Much has been written about it, ${ }^{1}$ so in these pages, I'll treat it more lightly than any other ward of Waterdeep. Any fool can see the mountain and the castle from far off. You don't need my words to find them!

Although it looks large on a map, much of it is taken up by Mount Waterdeep, the rugged height that protects much of the city from the full fury of the winter storms (which blow from west-northwest). The mountain is honeycombed with caverns and passages where the city guard maintains its armories, the city's

### Ward

granary and its flying griffon steeds. These caverns are linked to Castle Waterdeep, from which the ward takes its name, and various cliff top eyries (landing and springing-aloft areas for the griffons) - and, it is rumored, to both Piergeiron's Palace and the many levels of Undermountain, the vast dungeon or subterranean city beneath Waterdeep.

City watch and guard patrols are heavy in this ward. The city guard deliberately puts on a show of force in this district. ${ }^{2}$

### Landmarks

The most prominent landmarks of Castle Ward are the mountain and the castle. The next most important is the many-spired Palace of Waterdeep, popularly known these days as Piergeiron's Palace, after the First, and only

[^0]
[^0]: ${ }^{1}$ FR1 Waterdeep and the North describes features of Mount Waterdeep (page 22), Castle Ward (page 23), and all city features at some length. The City System boxed set includes detailed maps of the main aboveground structure of Castle Waterdeep, as well as detailed street maps of the city, and a selection of building floor plans. Module FRE3 Waterdeep contains notes on the Yawning Portal inn and a partial map of Blackstaff Tower.

    The Ruins of Undermountain boxed set describes the uppermost levels of vast Undermountain, including its surface connections and the infamous subterranean smuggling port known as Skullport. The novel Elfshadow gives the reader a taste of Waterdhavian social life, and a glimpse of many features of the city-including some ancient gates linking it with far places.  
    ${ }^{2}$ City watch patrols are detailed on page 17 of FR1 Waterdeep and the North. In this ward,four-sword detachments pass a given point about every 8 minutes and look into a tavern or inn dining room about every 20 minutes.

    As detailed on pages 15-16 and 23 of the City System set booklet, the city guard also patrols Castle Ward, in six-man detachments. Typical patrol details are as given therein, on page 23. Reinforcements will be a dozen LG hm F3s to F6s clad in chain mail and armed with maces, long swords, daggers, slings, and a polearm appropriate to the situation.

    Guard patrols pass a given street location about every 15 minutes, but appear in 1 d 4 minutes when a city watch patrol blows a warning horn in this ward.

publicly known, Lord of Waterdeep. His court is held there, and he entertains visiting embassies and envoys there on an almost daily basis. Accompanying one of them is probably the best way to get a look inside. The palace has four gates. From the north, these are Horn Gate, Sally Gate, Main Gate, and Guard Gate. You'll be challenged if you try to use any way in but the Main Gate.

So pass through it. The entry hall beyond is impressive enough-an echoing room all of polished marble, empty except for benches along the walls carved into the likenesses of seated lions, and the massive pillars that hold the upper floors of the palace up.

For me, though, the most impressive thing in the palace was the scale model of the entire city-building by building-set on a huge stone table in the office of the city clerks. To find it, turn right and go through the archway at the end of the entry hall. The large, grand stairs leading out of the hall in the other direction are the way to Piergeiron's court and audience chambers.

The palace stands with its back hard against a cliff face of Mount Waterdeep. To the north and south are barracks. A small tower set into a mountain cleft to the north guards an entrance to the tunnels of Mount Waterdeep.

Known, imaginatively enough, as the Mountain Tower, it is strictly off limits to the public.

There is a large open courtyard in front of the palace. To even get to the Main Gate, you must pass a lone tower in the midst of this open space: Ahghairon's Tower.

This slim stone tower has been totally enclosed above, around, and beneath in a series of potent, invisible magical barriers since the death of the famous wizard, many years ago. ${ }^{3}$ Don't approach too closely - on the north side, a skeletal figure still stands facing the tower with arms raised, about 10 feet away from its side. It is all that remains of a wizard who tried to get into the tower in order, no doubt, to seize Ahghairon's magic for himself. He dispelled the outermost barrier, a forcecage, but was trapped between it and the prismatic sphere within when the forcecage reformed behind him.

The man's name has been forgotten with the passage of years, and his robes and flesh have both rotted away, but the magic of the tower holds the bones in position. Until Piergeiron forbade it some years ago, it was a favorite game of local children to rearrange the wizard's bones. They can be dislodged with a stick, but they always drift slowly back into the same position, floating upright,

with arms outspread.  
If you travel north along the northern tongue of Mount Waterdeep from the palace, and turn west at its end, you will come to the sea at the end of Julthoon Street, which is the northernmost boundary of the ward. The land here falls away swiftly so you are higher than the city wall and can readily look over it, far out to sea. Here, in war, great engines have been set up to hurl rocks and fire at ships approaching the shore. In peacetime, these are all hidden away inside Mount Waterdeep and, rumor has it, in storage on the ethereal plane ${ }^{4}$-along with six companions of the silent sentinel who'll be standing looking out to sea with you: the Walking Statue of Waterdeep.

This 90 -foot-tall stone golem was created by Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun, the Archmage of Waterdeep. One of seven identical constructs, it is intended to fill and defend any gap in Waterdeep's walls created by a besieging foe. Of gray granite, it looks like a regal human with an impassive face-and it spends the years here, enduring the birds, as it stares endlessly out to sea, awaiting a call to service that

Waterdhavians hope will never come. ${ }^{5}$ It is sometimes used as a guiding beacon for expected ships during very rough storms. Wizards of the Watchful Order cast light spells upon it, and Piergeiron moves it to a desired signaling location.

The cliff that you and the Walking Statue are standing on top of is known as the Gull Leap for the seabirds that nest here, and for its use by misguidedly depressed people and stampeding cattle before the city wall was built. If you stay close to the wall and turn south, going along the western side of the tongue of Mount Waterdeep, you'll be in a little hidden corner of Waterdeep that even many folk in the city have never seen, and know about only vaguely. A street called the Cliffride runs to four luxurious villas that stand here amid trees and terraced gardens in a little ledge walled in by Mount Waterdeep.

These grand stone houses were built long ago by various noble families in this exclusive and readily defensible enclave. They soon fell out of favor. Lashed by the full fury of the sea storms, they are damp all year round and a nightmare of slick

[^0]
[^0]: ${ }^{4}$ Rumor, Elminster tells us, has it correctly. The ethereal plane also holds many extra sections of city wall that can appear in position along the eastern boundary of the city if Waterdeep is threatened.  
    ${ }^{5}$ Location \#44 on the color map. The Walking Statue is AC1, MV 4, has 18 HD and 140 hp , attacks once per round at THAC0 3, doing 6 d 10 damage with its mighty fists (against buildings 3 points of structural damage per round if the AD\&D® 1st Edition rules governing siege damage are used), and is harmed by spells as a normal stone golem is (see Vol. 1 of the Monstrous Compendium). To damage the Walking Statue, you must strike it with a +3 or better magical weapon. It is a minor crime of the Second Plaint (see Waterdeep and the North, pages 18-19) to deface the Statue by marking it.

ice everywhere outside and deathly chill inside during winter. They can be rented from their owners for $25 \mathrm{gp} /$ month and up ( $50 \mathrm{gp} /$ month during the summer), and are residences large enough to house up to 40 people each. As one proceeds south, they are: Fair Winds, on the sea side of the road; Marblehearth, on the land side; Stormwatch, on the sea side; and, tucked into the end of the land, overhung by a frowning cliff, Heroes' Rest. Heroes' Rest was nicknamed Cold Comfort by the Company of Crazed Venturers, who spent a winter here. The name has stuck in the city, and few now remember the proper name. If you're wealthy enough and don't mind fighting off the thieves who'll inevitably come to investigate anyone rich enough to stay here, these can be pleasant places indeed for a visitor to Waterdeep to stay for a month or more during a warm summer. Otherwise, be glad your bones sleep somewhere more dry.

The largest landmark of the built-up area of Castle Ward is also the largest open space in the city: the Market. The Market is encircled by Traders' Way on the north and Bazaar Street on the south. It is a huge marketplace often crammed with a maze of stalls and camped vendors. You can easily spend days and nights-except in winter-lost in the myriad shopping opportuni-

ties here. The place never closes for mere darkness. But be aware: Many thieves spend days and nights there, too.

It has been said many times that you can buy anything in Waterdeep, from ancient spells to floating cloud castles. Well, if you can't find it elsewhere in the city, come here.

The formal boundaries of Castle Ward are drawn by the water of the harbor and the coast up to Julthoon Street, and run along the south side of Julthoon Street to Shield Street, where they turn south to Traders' Way, run east to enclose the Market, and then turn south along the High Road all the way to Snail Street. Castle Ward takes in the west side of Snail Street down to Shesstra's Street, where it turns west to Gut Alley runs north on it to Belnimbra's Street, and thence to Lackpurse Lane. Dock Ward is to the east and south of Lackpurse Lane, and Castle Ward on its north and west as it runs to the harbor.

Folk in love with power but not yet rich enough to rise above the pursuit of it are said around the city to dwell in that part of Castle Ward north of the broad avenue of Waterdeep Way More southerly parts of the ward are dominated by the barracks and warehouses attached to the castle and by the Bell Tower (used to  
signal fires, attacks, and calls for assembly at the palace ${ }^{6}$ ), or are largely indistinguishable from the neighboring Dock Ward and the Trades Ward. Castle Ward's dockside is, however, far more heavily patrolled than Dock Ward, and hence safer for goods and visitors.

There's also an interesting feature in a warehouse located in the docks here at the foot of Coin Alley on its east side. In the warehouse's cellar is a shaft opening into a tidal wash under the building-a basin fitted with iron gratings. When the tide is in, fish often swim in. The gratings prevent some from swimming back out. At low tide, the warehouse owner can go down and fish in his own pond for fish to sell or for a meal.

The most famous feature of Castle Ward's docks, however, is Mirt's Mansion. This fortresshome nestles on the slopes of Mount Waterdeep amid stands of trees. It can be reached from Coin Alley or Tarnished Silver Alley both of which run to it, or from its own dock, the aptly named Smugglers' Dock.

Mirt the Moneylender is widely believed to be a Lord of Waterdeep. When in the city, this gruff ex-mercenary opens his house (before highsun only) for supplicants needing to borrow money. Although he seems a very

patient, even kindly sort when it comes to the repayment of loans, it doesn't seem that way to talk to him-and anyone thinking of paying an unauthorized visit to his home is warned that it bristles with more human, monstrous, and magical guards than I've ever seen in one place before.

The ward is also home to perhaps the most luxurious inn in Waterdeep, the Jade Jug, and to a large and splendid temple dedicated to Lathander Consisting of eight linked towers standing in their own walled, tree-cloaked compound, the Spires of the Morning rise to greet the morning sun in the angle between Julthoon Street and Calamastyr Lane. Traders' Way runs right to the temple gates. ${ }^{8}$

Between the temple and the Palace, along the eastern face of Mount Waterdeep, another splendid tower rises, surrounded by its own wall. This is Blackstaff Tower, home of the Archmage of

Waterdeep, Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun, his lady Laeral, and their apprentices. Laeral is a mage of power herself, who was once leader of the adventuring company known as the Nine, and sister to Alustriel, High Lady of Silverymoon; The Simbul, Witch Queen of Aglarond; Storm Silverhand, the Bard of Shadowdale, and others.

The ward is also home to many guildhalls: the House of Gems, of the Jewellers' Guild; ${ }^{10}$ the Map House, headquarters of the Surveyors', Map \& ChartMakers' Guild, ${ }^{11}$ Fellowship Hall, of the Fellowship of Innkeepers, ${ }^{12}$ the Master Bakers' Hall, of the Bakers' Guild, ${ }^{13}$ Guildhall of the Order, of the Solemn Order of Recognized Furriers \& Woolmen, ${ }^{14}$ the Pewterers' and Casters' Guildhall, ${ }^{15}$ the House of the Fine Carvers, of the Guild of Fine Carvers, ${ }^{16}$ and the Market Hall, of the Council of Farmer-Grocers. ${ }^{17}$ The most spectacular of these headquarters is the Tower of the

Several shopkeepers in the ward are also the heads or spokesmen for their guilds. If you like the taste of power and authority Castle Ward is the place to go.

### Places of Interest in Castle Ward

### Homes

### House of Loene

The walled home of the beautiful adventuress Loene resembles a miniature castle. Towers and turrets are everywhere, largely because Loene loves round rooms and curving stairs.

By night, or when expecting unwelcome visitors, Loene activates the magic of the ornate, 20 -foot-high iron fence surrounding her house. Any who touch it suffer miniature lightnings. ${ }^{19}$

Loene's home fronts on Waterdeep Way and backs onto Gem Street. During her remodeling of the mansion she purchased on this site, she tore down its extensive, warehouse-like rear and had a lawn, a garden, and a mature elm tree magically transplanted here-an interesting project that kept the mage Nain Keenwhistler busy for quite some time.

Loene's luxurious home is said to be furnished with beautiful things and to contain hidden

    ${ }^{19}$ Loene (pronounced LOW-enn) is detailed on page 53 of Waterdeep and the North, and also features in the novel Elfshadow. Her fence deals 2 d 4 points of electrical damage per contact or per round of continual contact, and has a special spellguard upon it. When dispel magic or disintegrate spells are cast on it, they are absorbed, their energy transformed instantly into chain lightning that strikes first at the source of the magic, and deals d 6 of damage per level of the caster of the original attacking spell.

magic items acquired during her adventures, but it is open only to her friends. It has other magical defenses, I'm told, that make it a veritable fortress.

### House of Shyrrhr

This Lady of the Court is good friends with Piergeiron, whom she aids by chaperoning visiting diplomats and learning all she can from them to pass on to the First Lord of Waterdeep. Her small but luxurious house on Waterdeep Way is simply but  
cozily furnished, with carpets, lounge cushions, three bedrooms with round canopied beds, a round bathing pool, and a formal dining room where she can entertain. ${ }^{20}$

They like to relax and talk together, and trust each other absolutely. Piergeiron pays Shyrrhr's few expenses in return for her spying and hospitality services to the city.

city-bred travelers live near one, or at least are familiar with Aurora's catalogue. This makes for minimal delay and uncertainty when emergency purchases must be made, and results in goods of known quality.

The Castle Ward Aurora's outlet is the first shopfront west of the Jade Jug, on the north side of Waterdeep Way. It provides home delivery for patrons by means of a coach and a six-man team within Castle Ward only. It also has four guards who work in shifts of two and two, a calmly cultured, middle-aged lady counter clerk, Cathal Sunspear, and a service-mage, Xanatrar Hillhorn. Xanatrar is known for his excellent singing at parties and whenever he wants to impress a good-looking lady.

### Balthorr's Rare and Wondrous Treasures

### 䍐䍐

This shop stands on the east side of the Street of the Sword, south of Selduth Street. The wealthy shopper can buy a wide selection of curios here, especially coins from all over Toril, gems, and regalia. The proprietor is an expert on the currency uniforms  
and badges used by most realms and military units of Faerun, and can make up colorful stories about the history of particular items on the spot. I've heard that he'll buy things without asking questions as to their originmaking him very handy for adventurers who want to exchange battle trophies for money.

Proprietor: Balthorr "the Bold" Olaskos, a hearty, loud-voiced, bubbling fellow with a ready smile and firm handshake, is the proprietor. ${ }^{21}$

### The Golden Key

### 䍐䍐䍐

This shop, on the east side of Warriors' Way, north of Waterdeep Way, ${ }^{22}$ sells locks and fastenings of all sorts except large, vault-like doors, door bars, and strongchests. The proprietor makes custom locks to order, and guarantees that he's never sold a key that will open the lock you buy from him to anyone else. (In other words, your lock is unique.) Many of his locks require several keys turned in certain combinations to open. All products are made on the premises, except for certain door chains, which are imported from the northern

He also wears a magical master key around his neck, that he tries to keep very secret. Over the years many have seen him use it and have deduced that it opens all normal locks on contact. If it encounters mechanical or magical traps on a lock, it reveals this to the wielder without triggering them, but does not open the lock or deactivate the traps. Its precise powers are not known to any in Waterdeep except Ansilver.

Proprietor: Ansilver the Locksmith, a white-haired, elderly but alert man, is the proprietor. He wears thick spectacles, has a sharp-beaked nose, and has a habit of humming continually.

### Halambar Lutes \& Harps

### 䇺䇺䇺

This shop, found on the east side of the Street of the Sword and a good walk up from Waterdeep Way sells all sorts of stringed musical instruments, from the lyre of Amn to the twostring of Mintarn. It is famous up and down the Sword Coast for the  
distinctive mellow sound of its lutes, but even Inner Sea folk have heard of the shop's prize attraction: the Harp that Sings by Itself.

This small, dark traveling harp sits on its own velvet-covered plinth, safely above the reach of inquisitive (or acquisitive!) visitors, and softly plays old airs, ballads, and lays of the North. It is said by some to have belonged to the famous bard Mintiper Moonsilver, but most dispute this. It is older than he, and was known to have been in Silverymoon when he was wandering the North. Its full powers aren't known to any alive in the Realms today and it is a unique magic item, truly beyond price. Halambar won't let

---

![img-14.jpeg](assets/Volo's%20Guide%20To%20Waterdeep_img-14.jpeg)  
patrons touch it and won't sell it. (I have discovered that the plinth it sits upon is actually a covered stone golem, placed there by Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun to protect the harp.)

Halambar's instruments typically cost $1,000 \mathrm{gp}$ each or more. He has smaller, plainer pieces made by his apprentices or secondhand pieces that go for mere hundreds of gold pieces. A place to visit, even if you're not musical.

Here's a special gift idea, for the rich only: For 600 gp , you can buy a jewel case or snuff box enchanted to play a short melody when opened. Exquisite, but somehow I feel you'd grow tired of the same tune quickly.

Proprietor: Kriios Halambar, guildmaster of the Council of Musicians, Instrument-Makers, and Choristers owns and runs this shop. He is an inscrutable, heavy-lidded man of long black hair, large black-pupiled eyes, and a strong streak of snobbery. ${ }^{24}$

### The Halls of Hilmer, Master Armorer

![img-15.jpeg](assets/Volo's%20Guide%20To%20Waterdeep_img-15.jpeg)

This shining shop has a front of armor plate-old armor from vanquished foes of Waterdeep, bolted together, polished a deep, gleaming blue, and protected from weather and theft by potent spells. Beware lightninglike arcs of energy should you strike or wrench at a piece! It stands on the west side of the Street of Bells north of Waterdeep Way its gleam visible up and down the street.

Inside is a showroom and fitting room, with doors into a weapons practice room for clients to practice running, turning, fighting, and climbing stairs in armor, and the huge, cluttered workshops of Hilmer and his apprentices. Plate armor hangs - or, in the form of full suits, stands everywhere. Hilmer only makes plate, but he's generally acknowledged as the best, or

[^0]
[^0]: ${ }^{23}$ Location \#26 on the color map. The distinctive sounds of Halambar lutes are largely due to his secretly soaking the wood he makes them of in Waterdhavian harbor water in his cellars. The precise powers of the Harp are left to the DM. Anyone who successfully makes off with it will be pursued by the Harpers - to whom the instrument is a treasure-as well as by agents hired by Halambar. It actually has nothing to do with Mintiper and was made long ago in lost and fallen Myth Drannor.

---

![img-16.jpeg](assets/Volo's%20Guide%20To%20Waterdeep_img-16.jpeg)  
among the best, in all the Sword Coast lands. His custom suits generally cost 4,000 to $6,000 \mathrm{gp}$, depending on the size of the wearer and the ornamentation. He hates chasing and overelaborate fluting, but has done enameled armors for Calishite satraps, at $8,600 \mathrm{gp}$ each.

Hilmer will sell existing armor apprentice pieces and replacement pieces, such as gauntlets, that are not custom fitted for mere hundreds of gold pieces, but he will not set his mark (a stamp of a gauntlet closing on a sword, and breaking it into three pieces) on such shelf stock. Hilmer armor is all custom made.

Hilmer knows at a glance if armor fits properly and at a touch if its metal is suspect or if a wearer is using a blade or shield too heavy for him. He is a master craftsman and regularly ignores offers of estates and thousands in gold to become master armorer of this or that kingdom.

Thieves leave his shop alone. It's much easier to steal Hilmer armor from those who have bought it-because several of the suits of armor are animated metal constructs, that defend the place at all times! Others protect his nearby metals warehouses.

Proprietor: Hilmer, the proprietor, is a tall, strong, and soft-

spoken man, with shoulders as wide as most doors and hands with a grip of iron. He is a just, honest man. ${ }^{24}$

### Olmhazan's Jewels

### 䍐䍐

This glittering shop stands on the west side of the High Road, just across from the mouth of Spendthrift Alley. Its front is fashioned of silvered and polished stone to resemble a huge faceted gem. "Olmhazan," said one noble to me at a feast, "has never been restricted by such trifles as good taste."

Inside, all the gems one can think of, except very rare or magical sorts, such as amaratha, kings' tears, and rogue stones, can be bought. A scattering of beljuril shards makes the impressive display of gems wink and sparkle continually.

Thieves are few since one was partially devoured by the guardians of the shop: two trained mimics. One masquerades as a gem display counter, and the other as part of the front doorjamb and the gigantic gem storefront.

Proprietor: Jhauntar Olm-  
hazan, Gentleman Speaker for the Jewelers' Guild, owns and runs this shop. He is a sneering, superior sort, who dismisses all country folk and those who dwell around or east of the Sea of Fallen Stars as barbarians. ${ }^{25}$

### Phalantar's Philtres \& Components

### 䍐䍐

This shop can be found on the east side of the Street of Bells, just north of Waterdeep Way. The odor of exotic spices wafts out onto the street whenever its circular door is opened. Inside is a strange wonderland of dried branches, firmly stoppered jars, and interesting-looking shells, skulls, baskets of bones, and labeled drawers.

Here you can buy medicines, herbs, and rare substances used in the making of perfumes, scented oils, poisons, and as material components in the casting of spells. The herbs aren't very fresh, but a wizard will find the selection here better than anywhere else I've ever seenand the proprietor doesn't ask questions about why you want baatezu blood or deadly night-

Theft is discouraged by the dust-covered, immobile stone form of a man, face eternally frozen in a look of fear, who's propped, arms spread and in a frantic running position, against a wall inside the door, "Oh yes," the proprietor purred, when I asked about him. "He tried to leave without paying, late one night when I wasn't even open. He ran afoul of a certain substance I keep handy. I haven't decided when to release him yet.

Try not to brush against him. 'Twould be a pity if he fell and shattered."

Nobles tell me this shop ${ }^{26}$ is guarded not only with dust of petrification, but with traps that release various paralyzing and sleep-inducing gases. They tell me the owner will sell you scrolls and any minor magic items he has on hand, too-if you ask quietly, and aren't known to have any connections to the city watch or city guard.

This watering hole is named for the blue leather armor worn by the proprietor in his long-ago adventuring days. The armor still hangs, in rotting tatters, above the bar. The tavern specializes in low prices and fast service. This specialization is a success; the place is always crammed. Folk go elsewhere to sit and chat or do business, but duck in here to load up on food and drink before hurrying on about their day. The Jack, as citizens call it (a short form of the name, true, but most call it that because of the many drinking jacks you can empty there), stands on the west side of the High Road, just north of its intersection with Waterdeep Way.

In such a busy place, encounters between enemies are not uncommon-but the staff can hurl drinking jacks hard and accurately from behind the bar, and six able-bodied scrappers can be mustered if the kitchens and bar are emptied by the proprietor.

Patrons are not encouraged to stay long-there are stools and stand-up elbowrests, but no booths or seats, and little food. Only cold cut platters, garlic sauce, pickles, handwheels of cheese, and hot biscuits covered with melted butter are available ( 1 cp per serving, each).

The drinkables are similarly limited: ale at $1 \mathrm{cp} /$ jack, bitters at 2 cp , stout at $3 \mathrm{cp}, \mathrm{zzar}$ at 4 cp , and wine at $4 \mathrm{cp} /$ tallglass (either Neverwinter white or red wine from Amn).

Proprietor: Immithar the Glove, a fast-moving, canny fellow, is the tavern's proprietor. He is quick with a joke or to mimic-perfectly-the speech of other folk. ${ }^{27}$

### The Crawling Spider

### 1999 DD

This strange place has a mock underground decor done with plaster slurry and rock rubble. Glowing mosses and lichens have been placed on the walls and ceiling and are watered regularly. These, plus a few netted glowing globes, provide a dim light for the place. Stuffed spiders have been affixed to the ceiling or hang from threads. The waitresses, hired for their sensuous walks and love of male company, wear black bodysuits and masks to make them look like drow.

Who drinks here? Dwarves, half-orcs, and other subterra-

nean dwellers who miss home, adventurers, and-surprisinglypriests of all faiths, looking for a thrill! They form a regular clientele, and have ever since this place opened. Of all the taverns in Waterdeep, the Crawling Spider has the most dedicated patrons. They will come clear across the city to drink here, ignoring other places.

The Spider never seems to close. The visitor soon discovers that one of the cave mouths leads to the jakes and another to a cellar dance floor. Many cave mouths open off this floor and lead to tiny private caverns used for intimate personal conferences and for  
planning shady business.  
If visitors cause trouble, patrons will leap to take care of it. And they include many veteran adventurers among their number!

The fare differs each night, but it's always $1 \mathrm{sp} /$ head, and always includes soup, a loaf of bread, meat, and fried greens. Drinks are extra. Ale is $2 \mathrm{cp} /$ tankard, stout 4 cp , and zzar or wine is 5 $\mathrm{cp} /$ tallglass. Whiskey is $1 \mathrm{sp} /$ flagon, and it's vile!

Proprietress: Welvreene Thalmit, a short, raw-voiced, and alluring woman with dark eyes, is this tavern's proprietress. She is romantic at heart who loves adventurers. ${ }^{28}$

The Dragon's Head Tavern  
(1) 1000

This modest place caters to older Waterdhavians: married couples, retired ex-adventurers, shopkeepers, merchants, and others who like to sit quietly and talk over their drinks.

Pipe smoke usually hangs heavy in the air in this place, and-because this place faces Ahghairon's Tower and the palace beyond-talk is often of politics, the future of Waterdeep, and of grand plans. Diplomats and visitors like to drop in here because it's safe and they're  
unlikely to be hailed by anyone or drawn into an argument.

The stuffed, mounted blue dragon's head for which the tavern is named was from a hatchling. It is dusty and motheaten with age, but still thrusts, large and menacing, well out into the taproom. One of the bartenders often hangs towels to dry from its teeth.

Tobacco ( $5 \mathrm{cp} /$ pouch) and drinks can be bought at the barbut aside from sausage rolls ( 4 $\mathrm{cp} /$ platter or $2 \mathrm{cp} /$ handplate) and stew ( $1 \mathrm{cp} /$ bowl), there's little food to be had here. Drinks are 1 $\mathrm{cp} /$ tankard for ale, 2 cp for stout, $2 \mathrm{cp} /$ tallglass for wine, and 3 cp

for zzar. The bar has an extensive selection of brandies, liqueurs, and rarities (such as firewine and elverquisst), which are sold by the glass. These cost from 7 $\mathrm{sp} /$ glass for brandy to $9 \mathrm{gp} /$ glass for elverquisst or Tashlutan amberthroat.

Proprietor: The proprietor, Vorn Laskadarr, is short, stubblefaced, and unlovely to the eye, but also quick, efficient, and kindly. ${ }^{29}$

### The Elfstone Tavern

### 䍿䍿䍿 0000

This old, dimly lit tavern stands  
on the east side of the Street of the Sword, north of Waterdeep Way. It caters to elves and halfelves, and is an earthy-smelling place, where living trees have been encouraged through elven patience and forestry skill to grow up from the cellar and through the taprooms. By day, rooftop shutters are pulled aside to let rain and sunlight in for the trees. By night, dancing lights spells bathe the place in soft, floating, blue motes of light.

Here elves gather to drink Evereskan clearwater ( $2 \mathrm{gp} /$ tallglass), moonwine ( $4 \mathrm{gp} /$ tallglass), elverquisst ( $14 \mathrm{gp} /$

tallglass), guldathen nectar (16 $\mathrm{gp} /$ glass) and maerlathen blue wine ( $17 \mathrm{gp} /$ glass), and dine on biscuits spread with roe, shrimp, spiced silverfin, crab meat, or mint jelly (all $1 \mathrm{gp} /$ platter). You can also eat skewers of sizzled squirrel, rabbit, or venison done in a green sauce ( 2 gp each). These are so good that the gods would ask for more!

Gentle harp, pipe, flute, and choral music is performed and service is fast, near-silent, and graceful. This is a place where dwarves and half-orcs will be driven away, some humans and half lings are tolerated in small parties, and even half-elves are just accepted - elves can be very supercilious when they choose to be. I saw even the various sorts of elves ignoring or otherwise being rude to each other. However, the mood is usually light or serene, and the owner and staff are moon elves, who welcome all. They will not allow anything to get too far out of hand.

If the elven patrons weren't such snobs, I'd give this place five full tankards. Go there to taste the food, if not to linger.

Proprietress: Yaereene Ilbaereth is the tavern's seemingly unaging proprietress. She is a tall, charming and regal elven woman with silvery eyes, who goes about with a grinning faerie dragon perched delicately on her shoulder. ${ }^{30}$

### The Red-Eyed Owl

### 䒜䒜 000

This is the closest thing Waterdeep has to a "local" - a comfortable, unimpressive, welcoming gathering place for the neighborhood. It is the kind of place where friends will come in and hail each other across the room, the food and drink will be pleasant, if unspectacular, and you'll be allowed to sit in peace and while an evening away over a tankard or two.

Food is a heavily spiced seafood stew (called coast chowder) or roast oxen done with a sweet-and-sour sauce and a dash of brandy to flame the outside as it's brought, blazing, to your table. Either way, it's 5 cp for a heaping platter or huge bowl (with huge slabs of fresh, warm crusty brown bread).

Drink is $1 \mathrm{cp} /$ tankard for ale, 2 cp for bitters, 3 cp for stout, $4 \mathrm{cp} /$ tallglass for zzar or red wine, and 5 cp for the rather sour white wine that is brought in from the proprietor's own land, and which he's inordinately fond of. It goes well with all sorts of cheese, though (especially the firmer, heartier sorts), and he sells it for carry-out at $2 \mathrm{sp} /$ bottle or 1 gp for a half-anker keg.

The Owl faces west. It is a rambling old wooden building that looks as if it's about to fall

into the street. But it has looked that way for at least 40 winters, patrons assured me, and hasn't fallen down yet. It is the point of an arrowhead-shaped block bounded by Rainrun Street, the confluence of Gut Alley and Belnimbra's Street, Snail Street, and an unnamed alley.

Proprietor: Balarg "Twofists" Dathen, a bluff, bristle-bearded man with long, unkempt red hair, owns and runs the tavern. His rough voice is much used for coarse jests, and he has an unutterably deadly aim with a hurled platter or tankard when anyone tries to start trouble. ${ }^{31}$

### The Sailors' Own $\$ \$ \$ \square$

This dockside tavern stands on Sail Street, across from the mouth of Tarnished Silver Alley with water lapping at the docks only a few strides away. The reek of fish-and rotting seaweed-hangs strongly about the whole area. Inside the tavern, the sailors seem to be trying to blot it out with the smells of their various and often exotic tobaccos.

The place is low-beamed and crowded, with weary sailors slumped on benches playing at

board games, cards, or merely getting thoroughly drunk. They are often left to sleep the night through here.

Anyone who's going to be sick is expected to make it out the dockside door first. Anyone who starts a fight will be thrown through that same door-luckily, it usually opens at the impact-by the proprietor, a man of prodigious strength. I saw him lift an entire table with one hand while he reached under it to snatch up a drunken sailor with the other! His aim and strength are sufficient to hurl a struggling brawler through the dockside door boots first-high enough to just clear the threshold and sail across the  
quayside beyond, straight into the water. It's worth a few coppers just to see this, but you don't want to be anywhere near when such trouble starts.

This place is just what its name implies. It belongs to the sailors, and they don't really want anyone else here. If you're not one, duck into it to avoid bad weather or thugs, but otherwise steer clear.

Interestingly, sailors here don't like to eat any sort of seafood they get little else on long voyages, I suppose. The fare here is pork, ox, or horse, either in roast portions ( $2 \mathrm{cp} /$ platter) or stewed with onions and greens ( $1 \mathrm{cp} /$ bowl). Drink is ale ( $2 \mathrm{cp} /$ tankard),

stout ( $3 \mathrm{cp} /$ tankard), zzar or brandy ( $4 \mathrm{cp} /$ tallglass), or whiskey ( $1 \mathrm{sp} /$ tallglass). That's the entire menu.

This tavern has an interesting sideline. The proprietor sells charts (with an emphasis on nautical usefulness) of many areas along the Sword Coast and around the known Sea of Swords for 45 gp each and up. A good or rare one will run into the hundreds of gold pieces.

Proprietor: The proprietor, Guthlakh "Hands" Imyiir, is huge, slow, and deliberate. He is also very strong and slow to smile, but not surly by any means. ${ }^{32}$

### The Singing Sword \$\$\$\$ DOO

This busy tavern stands on the north side of Bazaar Street, at the head of the Street of Bells. Three floors of busy diners enjoy one of the largest menus in Waterdeep, including the justly famous turtle soup-served in a turtle's upside-down shell-here each day. They are entertained by the highvoiced ballads of the wondrous magical blade for which the tavern is named.

### TROLLSONG

### Anonymous

In a cave there lived an old troll His diet grisly, his manners droll. Many a youth he caught and ate, "Raw, with carrots-really great."

In a castle there lived a knight His lance was long, his armor bright. Many quests he carefully planned But never went, his courage unmanned.

In a village there dwelt a maid The fairest that e'er the gods made. Poor but proud; she lived alone Beauty naught but skin and bone.

In a deep forest berries grew Bright and red, good but few. Hither went the lady fair Her savage hunger to repair.

In one sniff the troll knew The makings of a small meat stew Had wandered near his hidden home. To he who waits, all meals roam.

In a huff that knight so bold Rode out to spend grudging gold. For his cupboard was bare, ale lowAnd through the forest he did go.

In a trice, the lady found her food: Berries ripe, and berries good. By the handful she did eat. (The troll approached on nimble feet.)

Full, the maiden turned to go. Out leaped the troll, crying, "So! My dinner's come, in cap and gown!" And the knight, unseeing, rode him down.  
"Oh, my hero!" sighed the lady, "My life is thine-marry me!" The knight, afraid, backed his steedHooves again treading troll mead.  
"Good lady," stammered the warrior bold, "My sight is poor, my limbs are old. Am I then thy only choice?" "Yes," she cried, "And I rejoice!"  
"Oh, dear," then said noble knight And fainted dead away from fright. Over backwards he did crash. His armor making troll hash.  
"Oh, my lord!" cried the gentle maid. "So noble, so modest, so gently made!" And loving arms around him put, Trampling troll cakes underfoot.  
"What? Ho!" the dazed knight did moan. "I am beaten and overthrown! By my honor, I surrender me To my foe the victory!"

And he struggled to one knee His conqueror bright to seeBeheld in wonder blushing maid. (Under both, troll tiles thinly laid.)  
"I am yours! Command me, I beg!" Quoth the knight, making a leg. "Up then, sir!" said that lady "My lord and husband thou shalt be!"

And up he got, armor a-clank, (Troll blood unwitting spurs drank), And set his lady upon his horse. Together they rode o'er troll-of course.

And when the hooves had died away, The troll on the ground did stay, Feeling every little bit of pain As his bits came together again.

But men, like trolls, never learn Beautiful maidens sharp to spurn, And so the song goes round again The fallen always suffering pain.

Oh, in a cave there lived an old troll … (Song repeats)

ago, and is thought to have been forged in ancient Netheril. It customarily stands upright, hilt uppermost, in the open central well of the tavern, encircled by the spiraling stairs to the upper floors, and is silent.

Once an hour, one of the tavern staff-usually a pretty girl in mock armor, struggling under the weight of the blade-lifts the blade and holds it high, for it will only sing when grasped and ordered. The will of the holder actually determines the songand angry or upset holders thoughts have been known to make the blade segue into a second song after it has begun singing.

The sword's magic has never failed yet. It seems immune to the effects of dispel magic - in fact, applying one when the blade is held by a living being causes it to snarl in anger and scorn! It seems to know 30 or so songs, mainly tragic ballads, love laments, or roaring warriors' songs, with a few comedy pieces thrown in. Its voice is high, clear, and almost bell-like on high notes, but somehow male-  
though it has been known to mimic the voices of others who sing along with it in order to better harmonize. ${ }^{33}$

I've included the lyrics of Trollsong, a comedy ballad that seemed a special favorite of the patrons, so that you can sing along if you visit the Sword and not feel out of place. Everyone in the place roars and minces their way through this one, and bellows for it to be sung at least twice through each time.

The Sword has a simple way of dealing with prices: All meals are 1 gp per platter, whatever you order. This includes a tallglass or tankard of whatever you want. Subsequent drinks are $1 \mathrm{sp} /$ tankard for any beer or $1 \mathrm{gp} /$ tallglass for zzar or any wine. The exotic drinkables (elverquisst, dragonstongue, firewine, and Fires of Mirabar whiskey) are few or missing altogetherno surprise, at these prices.

Whenever I went, I found the Sword to be a lively place, brightly lit and full of crowds of folk enjoying their meal-and their visit with friends at adjacent tables. This is obviously a popu-

[^0]: ${ }^{33}$ The Singing Sword is location \#41 on the color map. The Singing Sword is a chaotic good, intelligent long sword +2 , which has the extraordinary powers of levitation and teleportation (as detailed in the DUNGEON MASTER ${ }^{34}$ Guide, page 187). When wielded by a bard, it allows him or her to strike one extra attack with it per round, at an additional +2 attack bonus (so the attack roll is at +4 , though the damage roll remains +2 ). It is immune to dispel magic, disintegrate and all lightning or electrical spells or magical effects, and confers this protection to its wielder and all within a $5^{\prime}$ radius. Such effects are drawn into the sword and harmlessly absorbed to sustain and renew its own magic.

    The Sword sings when it pleases. It performs for Gothmorgan because it likes him-and will use its extraordinary powers to elude anyone it doesn't want wielding it. It will only allow Gothmorgan, a good-aligned bard (or in an emergency, if Gothmorgan, his staff, or the tavern are threatened, anyone willing to wield it to defend them) to wield it. It may have other, as yet unknown, powers-and Elminster believes it is of Netherese origin.

lar place with many regulars. The food's good, too. Any visitor to Waterdeep will find this place worth a visit to hear the Singing Sword burst into song.

### The Sleepy Sylph

### 䒠䒠䒠 8888

This popular tavern stands at the southwest corner of the intersection of Rainrun and Snail Streets, at the other end of the same small block of buildings as the Red-Eyed Owl. Its frankly risque signboard depicts the sylph the tavern is named for.

But while the Owl is a cozy local watering hole, this place caters to visitors. Lots of colored driftglobes float about, and many scantily clad waitresses (wearing diaphanous robes and fairy wings of silken gauze stretched over fine wire) hurry about, dodging the strolling minstrels hired by the tavern.

Under the many-hued, drifting lights, patrons can eat almost nothing and drink as much as they can afford. Only skewered whole fowl-chicken, quail, turkey, or pheasant-are on the menu ( 1 gp each). Each fowl comes with a darkbread trencher and a plate of lemon slices that most patrons use to cut the  
grease from their fingers after eating the fowl.

Drink is $3 \mathrm{cp} /$ tankard for ale, 5 cp for bitters, 7 cp for stout, $1 \mathrm{sp} /$ tallglass for zzar or house red or white wine, and 2 gp to 25 gp by the bottle for more exotic things. Locals in the neighborhood no doubt come here for a single drink, to enjoy the music and to watch the waitresses-and then go to the Owl, just steps away to eat and drink at about a third the price. (I saw more than watching going on, but turned modestly back to my glass, which was practically sobbing to have more little drinks poured into it.)

For the money, though, you get spotless white tablecloths, good food brought to you in a hurry, music, and a chance to see other rich folk dining. If you aren't rich, why are you here?

Proprietor: The owner and operator of the Sleepy Sylph is Callanter Rollingshoulder, a tall, fat man dressed in dark silken robes and a red Calishite sash, with the bushy ends of his truly magnificent mustache adorned with tiny, golden, chiming bells. ${ }^{34}$

On the northwest corner of the intersection of the High Road and Waterdeep Way stands what

has been called Waterdeep's plushest inn. It deserves its prime location-many noble families would envy the spotless, luxurious accommodations. Every detail, from handsoap bowls beside the piped-water baths, within easy reach of a reclining bather, to the bedside icebox filled with shrimp snacks and chilled wine, has been thought of. Guests are attended by a personal servant of their choice for the duration of their stay from those not presently engaged with another customer. Their every need is attended to: Food is brought, a coach (or, in icy winter weather, a sledge) is brought around if the guest wishes to go out in the city, and anything a guest gets dirty is instantly whisked away and replaced with a clean duplicate.

Decor is muted, not garish or in bad taste (unlike the Unicorn's Horn across the way). Quite simply I felt like a pampered king during my one-night stay. But with rooms 12 gp to $30 \mathrm{gp} /$ night and suites 25 gp to 50 gp , one night was simply all I could hope to afford!

Until you've been bathed by a cheerful, skillful, beautiful maid who wears white gloves as she soaps you, you haven't lived. If you've gold enough, go to the

Jade Jug. I'll never sneer at pampering again.

Proprietress: The charming, beautiful, one-armed hostess is Amaratha Ruendarr. She notices every detail, and remembers the names of guests' pets, children, or mates from their last visit, a year or more ago! ${ }^{35}$

### The Pampered Traveler

### 1111 1212

This inn, with large, conicalroofed, many-windowed turrets at its either end, stands like an exotic castle, dark and somehow inviting, on the northeast corner of the meeting of Selduth Street and the Street of Bells. Room rates here run from 6 gp to 12 $\mathrm{gp} /$ night, depending on the room you choose.

The Pampered Traveler's name sets high expectations, and they are not disappointed. Servants conduct you to your large and well-furnished rooms, which are kept warm but not overwarm, and come within breaths if you ring for them. Each room has a bell pull by the door.

On the main floor is a huge smoking room with a roaring hearth full of old, soft, vast armchairs that can easily swallow up smaller visitors, a playnursery for the children of

guests (a rare and thoughtful feature), a gaming room, and three small, private meeting rooms for the use of guests. There is also, surprisingly, a library filled with books handcopied by the staff and a reading table with a glass top, under which can be seen as full and complete a map of the known Realms as far west as the Moonshaes, as far east as Thay, and as far south as the Shaar, as I've seen anywhere. (The staff spends one morning a week, each, on the task of hand-copying the books.)

The proprietor is keenly interested in exploration. Present in the library along with a  
chapbook put out by the Merchants' League describing the exploits of the famous Dabron Sashenstar and his mapping of a trade route linking known lands to Sossal, there are even copied letters from sea captains who have reached Maztica, far away across the sea.

All of the guests are welcome to read - though I get the feeling anyone who departed with as much as a single page would be pursued by the master of the house until he separated the thief from his head! I have also heard of a man staying free at the inn for a week in exchange for gifting the proprietor with a

---

particular highly valued book.  
When I cautiously discussed reading matter with the master, he said the only things he didn't want in his library were magical texts. They intrigued him, but they also brought potential danger into his inn and attracted the wrong sort of readers. Twice he had to break down the doors of his library and put out firesand once run pell-mell through the streets to Blackstaff Tower to call on Khelben Arunsun himself to come and bind a summoned abishai baatezu!

Most of the staff are middleaged, motherly, pleasant women ("Young, pretty ones bring only trouble," the master told me). They do a good job of cleaning up after messy guests as they go along and of bringing wine, hot cider, ale or stout to guests upon request. (These drinks are included in your room price).

In the morning, there's complimentary hot egg, vegetable, and beef broth soup (better than it sounds), and each evening guests are welcome to come down to the common rooms and cut themselves slices of beef, goat, venison, or pork from the sideboard platters. Mustards, pickles, horseradish, and hot southern sauces are on hand to garnish the meat. All of this is included in your room fee-but if you bring in your own guests (who are not staying at the inn) to dine with  
you, their fare costs you an additional $1 \mathrm{gp} /$ meal per head.

All in all, a quietly luxurious place to stay. This is undoubtedly the wealthy scholar's choice of hostel.

Proprietor: The Pampered Traveler is run by Brathan Zilmer, guildmaster of the Fellowship of Innkeepers. He is a solemn, careful, darkly handsome man with an air of mystery and wariness about him. ${ }^{36}$

### Festhalls

### Mother Tathlorn's House ofPleasureandHealing Festhall \& Spa

### 88888

This is the most famous house of pleasure in Waterdeep, and that's not surprising. Located on Gem Street, just off Waterdeep Way, and across from the foot of the road down from the Grain Gate of Castle Waterdeep, it's a large, five-floored building with two additional levels of dungeons below ground, in which absolutely no expense has been spared on props.

There are wardrobes full of all sorts of clothes, from silk and lace nightdresses to pirate outfits, full plate armor (made of silverpainted padding, to lessen injuries), and barbarian berserker garb. There are several rooms full of jungle plants, with heated

[^0]

pools in them and carefully tended mossy banks. There are four-poster beds with trampolines and rings that can be set aflame. There are even pairs of rings of levitation to be used in rooms with glowing globes and floating mirrors. If you can think of it, someone already has, and it can be found here.

The strength of any festhall, however, lies in its staff, who must be skilled and must enjoy their work. The men and women in this festhall are experts. (Mother Tathlorn owns another fest-hall-she won't reveal which one-in which staff are trained on the job. They don't get to work here until they are skilled at their craft.)

Mother Tathlorn's has on staff several priests of Sune. In return for offerings to the goddess, they heal torn muscles and sprained limbs. Almost all of the rest of the staff are trained and capable masseuses - and in fact, the most popular service performed at Mother Tathlorn's is massage and bathing, especially of elderly male and female citizens of Waterdeep who are wealthy enough to afford it-either daily or whenever they can muster coins enough.

Here in warm, cozy, private comfort, your aches and pains can be soothed away in a scented or mineral water bath or in heated steam baths, and you can drift off to contented slumber,  
secure in the knowledge that your person and well-guarded belongings are safe. Or, you can visit with a friend, or even strangers, while all of you are massaged. Unlike in some other realms, in Waterdeep there's nothing embarrassing about going to a festhall. It's simply part of life for those who enjoy it.

There are two privacy floors, where staff and the many doors, hangings, dim lighting and secret passages make sure patrons don't see each other. These floors also have separate entrances via tunnels into an adjacent building to the west on Gem Street, so that patrons who demand discretion won't be seen entering or leaving. Mother Tathlorn also has six skilled bouncers-one a wizard armed with a wand of paralyzation and silence spells-for patrons who become difficult.

All of this luxury and pleasure doesn't come cheaply. Expect to spend 4 gp at the door, plus 25 gp per staff person who assists you. Patrons who don't pay the full shot when they depart must leave collateral. Lacking collateral, they must go home with only a thin cloak and the keys to their lodgings (a practice that affords the Watch much innocent amusement-especially on snowy nights). Most regular patrons run a credit accountbut also tip staff members very handsomely, often effectively doubling their fee.

This large, but plain-looking, stone and mudbrick building

the way it was written. Such private performances of ten involve risque audience participation or private jokes-or even entirely new (sometimes wretched) plays, written by the noble who's hired the company.

More often, however, the Siren is home to traveling troupes of vaudeville jugglers, comedians, and nearly nude dancers or burlesque dancers. When these aren't available, the theater company performs-usually a weekly revue consisting of timehonored gag routines and sketches rewritten to include references to daily happenings and current jokes.

Admission varies from $4 \mathrm{cp} /$ head to $6 \mathrm{gp} /$ head, depending on who or what is performing. Famous bards are the most expensive-and fastest selloutdraws. The take is split evenly between theater and performers. The theater in all cases provides heating via warm flue pipes fed by a hearth under the stage, lighting (usually glowing globes) and security. Most traveling troupes charge from 2 sp to $8 \mathrm{sp} /$ head ( $1 \mathrm{gp} /$ head if burlesque dancers are involved). The weekly revue put on by the locals is always 4 cp .

Before and between performances, the place is used for drinking and dancing to live music, sometimes with show dancers on the stage. Ale is 3 cp per tankard, stout is 6 cp , and  
zzar or wine is sold by the bottle, at 7 sp each.

Proprietor: Perendel Wintamer, a young, earnest, mustachioed mage, runs this nightclub. He often must use his spells to clear birds out of the dark upper reaches of the building.

### AlLeys

Castle Ward's alleys are among the safest in the city. Since most folk of importance travel about with bodyguards or friends, thieves aren't in the habit of making strikes in this ward. The most frequent users of the alleys by day are tradesmen making deliveries. By night they are used most often by city watch or city guard patrols hurrying from this place to that.

Many of the so-called alleys in this ward have long since become proper streets, such as Coin Alley and Tarnished Silver Alley, and are not included here.

### Asmagh's Alley

### 2

Running south off Selduth Street through the interior of the long city block between the Street of Silver and Warriors' Way, this long, winding alley is considered to end when it meets Palfrey Lane to the south.

It is named for a notorious apothecary who flourished (if that's the word) in Waterdeep

some 60 winters ago. He was a poisoner, and buried his victims by night, lifting the stones of this alley to place them underneath and carrying away the dirt left over in his cart. After he was discovered at it and slain, the Watch uncovered over 80 bodies under these flagstones, and searched diligently to be sure they missed none. It's an old Waterdhavian joke to refer to Asmagh as "the Ambassador" because, they say "He welcomed so many folk to the City" ("the City" to a citizen of Waterdeep, means the City of the Dead).

Today, this long way is crowded with delivery crates, barrels,  
scattered garbage, and rats.  
Thugs sometimes mug folk here on the darker nights, trusting to the length of the alley to run down prey. Sometimes they even scatter marbles, beforehand, so their fleeing prey is sure to take a nasty fall.

### Buckle Alley

### $\checkmark$

This narrow passage winds east and westward across four city blocks, from the High Road in the east to the heart of the block west of the Street of Silver at its other end. It lies about a third of the way south from Selduth Street to

---

![img-27.jpeg](assets/Volo's%20Guide%20To%20Waterdeep_img-27.jpeg)

Waterdeep Way and has always been a busy thoroughfare used by carters, tradesmen making deliveries, and local folk on foot.

It is named for an old saying. City guardsmen were told to buckle on their blades before they set foot in it, as it was once the heart of Thieves' Guild territory, before that organization was driven out of Waterdeep.

Of old, thieves used to sit on stools in this alley drinking, drawn swords laid naked across their laps in case the city watch showed up. Their favorite tipple was Black Grog Ale, from the pirate isles of the Sea of Fallen Stars.

That brew is still a favorite in this area today. Barrels of it are imported all the way from Immurk's Hold for the locals to buy here, or to consume at local taverns.

### Cat Alley, a.k.a. Cats Alley

![img-28.jpeg](assets/Volo's%20Guide%20To%20Waterdeep_img-28.jpeg)

Winding through the interior of the city block bounded by Waterdeep Way, the High Road, Buckle Alley and the Street of Bells, this narrow passage has many confusing twists and turns. Many a visitor to the city has become lost in its mud and dark corners. Deliveries are made here, and

---

![img-29.jpeg](assets/Volo's%20Guide%20To%20Waterdeep_img-29.jpeg)  
there are rows of apartments and warehouses that stand in the interior of the block and can only be reached by means of this alley. Traditionally, gangs of street youths have battled for control of this many-branched passage, but in recent years, heavy city watch patrols have ended the wildest turf battles and made this a fairly safe place to walk.

Recently however, a masked, rapier-wielding, quietly chuckling assailant has made this a dangerous place for women after dark. By his dress and manner he is wealthy and probably noble, but he has not yet been apprehended, and has cut away a lot of female garments,  
frightened a lot of folk, and caused at least two deaths: one lady who couldn't escape him and was found run through, and a would-be rescuer was killed on another occasion. The chuckling masked man calmly cut the rescuer's throat, and then strolled away, leaving the lady he had trapped untouched.

### The Cat's Tail

The southernmost loop of Cat Alley, this passage runs behind two guildhalls, the Blue Jack tavern, and the Jade Jug, whose stables stand across it. The influence of the money and power

vested here has caused this alley to be brightly lit by glowing globes by night that are firmly fixed in high wall brackets and on roof overhangs and patrolled by private guards, who are armed with warning horns, ${ }^{39}$ clubs, and daggers. Patrons from the Jack have been known to aid these guards when they sound their horns-and as a result, the masked assailant who haunts Cat Alley keeps clear of this southern loop, and thieves are few indeed. The guards like to gossip about events in the city and for a copper piece or two will even recommend taverns, shops, inns, certain folk, festhalls - and even fences. ${ }^{40}$

### Duir's Alley

$\mathcal{B}$  
This alleyway enters the city block bounded by the Street of Bells, the Street of the Sword, Waterdeep Way and Selduth Street on its east side, just beside (to the north of) the Halls of Hilmer. It forks, going north and south past Hilmer's two metals warehouses to run down the west side of the interior of the block. The alleyway branching off to run down the eastern interior of the block is called Lhoril's Alley.

Today, this busy, winding  
passage is often the scene of spell demonstrations and practice, as patrons or staff spill out of the rear of the Elfstone Tavern and unleash magic down the alley sometimes to the vast surprise of someone coming along it!

More than once, visitors to Waterdeep coming to the apartments in the center of this block after dark have been astonished to find two or more elves chatting, wineglasses in hand, as they float in midair, surrounded by a glowing nimbus of blue light. The elves generally ignore such passersby-but if someone stops and is obviously listening, they have been known to drive the eavesdropper away with spells.

### Elsambul's Lane

$\mathcal{B}$  
This short alleyway runs up and down the interior of the city block bounded by Bazaar Street, the Street of the Sword, Cymbril's Walk, and Warriors' Way. It is crossed, and most easily reached, by Lamp Street.

Elsambul was a priest of Mask, who lived somewhere along this alley over 70 winters ago. He held the view that thieves should not be crude snatch-and-grab thugs, but a deft, subtle brotherhood of organized companions. He began to gather a band under his

leadership, but was betrayed by an underling. He fell fighting defiantly here, using his magic to take as many foes as, possible with him - a defiant last stand that left the alley red with blood and strewn with bodies (or parts of bodies), local tavern tales attest.

Elsambul began the practice of writing cryptic messages for his gang along the walls of this lane, and this graffiti writing has been taken up by others. It is absent from almost everywhere else in Waterdeep. Today, the visitor can see some amusing, puzzling, and disgusting messages from one Waterdhavian to another (most of them unattributed).

Many of the messages hint at treasure to be won, dragons to be duped or destroyed, and great adventure. Others promise revenge or that something will not be forgotten. Adventures should find them intriguing and perhaps even useful.

It helps to be a confident adventurer just to go into this alley. You never know just who (or what-I'm sure I saw purple tentacles under that hood!) you may find reading the messages.

### Howling Cat Court

This small open space inside a city

---

block (west of the Street of Silver and east of the Street of Silks, and south of Selduth Street) is infamous as a clandestine meeting place for ladies of the evening and their clients, street gangs, and others. Thieves lurk here, too. The city watch comes here often, frequently in triple patrol strength-because they never know just who they'll find here. Once it was a dozen angry heavily armed minotaurs, released from magical stasis by an evil mage!

### Jesters' Court

### 200

This famous local landmark and meeting place lies north of Howling Cat Court, just south of Selduth Street in the same block. It's a large courtyard used by ladies of the evening and by minstrels (sometimes both are the same person, as with the famous Masked Minstrel). Sometimes on warm summer evenings it becomes an improvised dance court for the locals, lit by faerie fire or dancing lights conjured by a mage or apprentice.

Of old, jugglers and comics used to perform here for thrown coins (hence its name), but none are left now but a few men too old to perform. They sometimes come here of afternoons to just stand and remember.

By night, trouble in Howling Cat Court tends to spill over into  
here, too-and more than once warring gangs, bands of thieves, or adventuring groups have drawn steel and had it out here, until bodies were slumped on the cobbles and the shouts, screams, and clangor and skirl of blades brought both the watch and the city guard on the run. By Waterdhavian legend, it's also the place for couples in love to meet before eloping.

### Lemontree Alley

### 20

Opening off Shadows Alley north of Cage Street in the first block of buildings east of Piergeiron's Palace, this tiny threelegged passage is crowded with the lemon trees for which it is named. Brought here by a local wizard, whose spells give heat enough to keep them alive, these tropical trees are an unexpected delight. Waterdeep is much too cold for them to survive under normal conditions. Those who are tempted to take fruit from the trees, break a branch off, or just take a swing at one of them, are warned that the wizard, Narthindlar of the Nine Spells, has set a guardian monster on these trees: a bear (a monster zombie) that usually sits quietly under one of the trees. If you harm or take from a tree ${ }_{t}$ it rises up and drives you away. ${ }^{41}$

[^0]
[^0]: ${ }^{41}$ See Volume 1 of the Monstrous Compendium under "Zombie." The bear will not leave the trees, but will fight until destroyed or until offenders leave the vicinity.

---

![img-32.jpeg](assets/Volo's%20Guide%20To%20Waterdeep_img-32.jpeg)

Narthindlar has provided benches under the trees, and can sometimes be found sitting on one of them, puffing on a pipe and contemplating life, Faerun, and magic. He smokes tobacco into which cherries have been crushed, and it gives off a delightful odor. Diplomats who need to blow off steam or chat away from prying ears in the palace some times find their way here, too.

### Lhoril's Alley

This winding passage links Duir's Alley with Waterdeep Way, running down the eastern  
interior of the city block bounded by the Way and by the Street of Bells, Buckle Alley, and the Street of the Sword. By day, it's a busy delivery area and garbagepiling place.

Named for the sorceress who met her death here, battling tanar'ri summoned by an overambitious apprentice, this passage is known to be haunted by the phantom sounds of running, staggering footsteps (origin unknown). They can be heard at any time of day hurrying northwards from Waterdeep Way as if a man or heavily laden woman in boots was fleeing frantically with their last, failing energy. No

![img-33.jpeg](assets/Volo's%20Guide%20To%20Waterdeep_img-33.jpeg)  
breathing is ever heard, and no magic or barrier seems to silence or stop this phantom - nor does it respond to the calls or actions of living beings.

### The Prowl

### 222

This short alley loops eastwards off Alnethar Street, and also, by a side spur, links up with Cymbril's Walk to the south. It provides rear access to a row of shops and to a row of apartments that stand in the center of the block. The Prowl is named for the acts of an eccentric nobleman who used to loose his pet panthers to stalk around it, terrorizing the neigh-  
borhood (until one of the cats grew exasperated - or just hun-gry-one day and ate him). This otherwise unimportant alleyway is the favorite hunting ground of a pair of skeletal hands that strangle folk from behind, leaving wither-scars graven deep into victims' throats where each finger has been. Some folk who have glanced into the alley at night but not entered have reported seeing two points of light close together in the air, like floating glowing eyes.

This frightening killer doesn't strike often-four times a year, at most-and seems adept at evading detection whenever powerful wizards and priests come

---

![img-34.jpeg](assets/Volo's%20Guide%20To%20Waterdeep_img-34.jpeg)  
looking for it. No one is yet sure what it is - let alone how to destroy it. It only seems to be active in the hours of darkness, and never strikes at folk in buildings, but only out in the alleyway. ${ }^{42}$ I recommend visitors avoid this area until news comes that this mysterious menace has been destroyed.

### The Reach

This short side way runs north-  
west off Lackpurse Lane to the west of Dretch Lane, climbing a steep slope to reach a cluster of warehouses - including Crommor's Warehouse. ${ }^{43}$

It's named after the nautical term reach, and got the name after a group of sailors watched a companion, in icy winter weather, come out of one warehouse and slide-quickly and helplessly, arms windmilling just to stay upright-down it and across Lackpurse Lane into the buildings beyond, where he

fetched up against a wall of crates with the inevitable crash.

It's a popular place for sailors to hang out these days, telling yarns of their lives at sea and looking for trouble. Don't approach unless you're looking for a fight-which is what I watched a trio of adventurers do, one evening, deliberately starting a brawl so they could smash heads against walls, hurl sailors down into Lackpurse Lane, and generally send teeth flying.

### Sevenlamps Cut

This short cut-through links Swords Street and the Street of Silks, just south of Selduth Street. The alley is named for the seven ornate, everburning, magical lamps installed here long ago by a now-forgotten mage (some say Ahghairon himself).

This handy passage is not only safe and well-lit, it is a popular destination, day and night-for by some tradition whose origins are also now forgotten, this is the place where apprentice (not yet members of the Watchful Order, or visiting) wizards and starving or wandering underpriests in need of money gather to offer their services at spellcasting in return for coin. They cluster here in tiny knots of three and four, waiting for a chance to demonstrate their Art.

Wounded men have been  
known to stagger and crawl here after tavern brawls, leaving a trail of blood and hoping to buy healing-if they make it. This is the place to hire a spellcaster for a few days' aid if you're about to brave Undermountain's depthsor to have a curse removed or your friend who's been cruelly polymorphed into a pink frog changed back into his rightful form.

### Shadows Alley

This long passage links the back doors of shops, grand homes, and apartments that face Piergeiron's Palace along the eastern side of the Street of Silks with Cage Street, Lemontree Alley, and Mulgomir's Way.

It's named for the undead that haunted it in earlier days, before a determined effort was made to root them out and destroy them (and block the sewer connection they retreated into, when priests came looking for them).

No shadows have been seen in Shadows Alley for almost 20 winters now, and today the alley is known more as a way for important visitors to the city and wealthy merchants to slip out of their lodgings and go in search of nighttime companionship and revelry without being seen. It is also known for the (illegal) duels often fought at night here by diplomats or young nobles who

---

![img-35.jpeg](assets/Volo's%20Guide%20To%20Waterdeep_img-35.jpeg)  
both think they'll win, and want to leave the body of their fallen foe contemptuously on the palace steps-or throw it into the spell defenses of Ahghairon's Tower, so as to confuse any detection magics used on it to determine who the killer was or to impair attempts at resurrection. In many such duels, magical cheating goes on-one or both parties employs hidden magic items or weapons-and such a release of Art almost always alerts city guard duty wizards at the palace and causes general mayhem as wizards and warriors rush towards the alley from various nearby barracks and guardposts.

### TurnbackCourt

### F

This westernmost extension of Selduth Street is a short stub that allows access to a few buildings nestled against the eastern cliff face of Mount Waterdeep. The reason for its name is obvious. Lit by bright lamps by night, it is a rallying point for city watch and city guard patrols.

The large building that walls off the north side of the Court, hidden from the view of most who pass on Swords Street by the bend in Turnback Court, is a warehouse that, I'm told, is owned by a mysterious organiza-

tion-the Harpers, perhaps, or the Red Sashes, or an arm of the Lords' Alliance, or maybe a cabal of wizards-and holds hidden a number of items of powerful magic, including (several locals whispered to me, on separate occasions) a small ship, that sails the sky instead of water! ${ }^{44}$ When I tried to investigate, I was politely told to be on my way or Piergeiron would have gained one over-inquisitive visitor to put onto a convict ship and send far, far away!

### Zeldan's Alley

### 28

This narrow winding way runs south from the Crawling Spider tavern, along whose south wall it connects with the Street of the Sword, past a pleasant little well of safe drinking water shaded by trees to circle around the southern interior of the city block bounded by the Street of the Sword, Waterdeep Way, Warriors' Way, and Buckle Alley Along the way, it offers back door access to the Golden Key and other shops, townhomes, and apartments.

Zeldan was a short, puffing merchant who was a devout worshipper of Gond. He finally met his doom some 30 winters ago in the arms of an automaton that came to life too soon and too vigorously and smashed him  
through a wall it was supposed to raise him gently up to paint!

Unfortunately for all concerned, Zeldan built most of the warehouses and townhomes that fill the center of this block-and under cover of the construction, spent much of his fortune sponsoring priests of Gond who came to Waterdeep on ships from Lantan to build and install various experimental devices in this alleyway. Some of them still lurk, hidden beneath paving stones and behind walls, waiting for the unwary to trigger them. Some are harmless or do nothing more than make grinding noises and lurching movements (they were either faulty designs or have broken since installation) but some are mechanical traps and killing devices that rank right up there with the most horrible killing devices that rich fiends in Thay and Calimshan have devised! A few still pop up from time to time, frightening, crippling, or slaying outright the folk who discover them. Be warned-and avoid this alleyway unless unavoidable business takes you there.
