# Other Places of Interest in Trades Ward

In the crowded streets and byways of the Trades Ward, the determined shopper or enterprising merchant can spend a summer or two without poking his nose everywhere or doing business with everyone. I've done my best to set down here some of the shops and sights of universal interest-or at least those of note to the casual passerby rather than to the dedicated shopper.

Earlier, I spoke of such landmarks as the Plinth and the open squares and courtyards-and it bears repeating that to visit the closest thing Waterdeep has to a bazaar (an open air market, crowded with many everchanging stalls) the Court of the White Bull is your place. It's named, by the way for a now-vanished tavern, famous in its day that sprawled over much of where the court now lies and was destroyed in a mighty explosion in the infamous battle between the archmage Thongalar the Mighty and the evil mage Shile Rauretilar and his apprentices.

In the spellstorm that befell here, Shile and his apprentices all perished, and the very fabric of Faerun was rent, so that Azuth  
the One appeared to set things right. Even today, it is said that magic sometimes goes awry in the Court-and for that reason, magic items, scrolls, components, and demonstrations are all forbidden in the Court?

The White Bull tavern was in turn named for an albino bull born on this spot to an astonished caravan owner in the days when this area was an open field for livestock and caravan assembly. He took it as a good omen.

Caravan Court, to the south, is a popular spot for loafers and old men to sit (many bring stools or crates for the purpose) and watch men sweat and curse, animals bellow and thunder about, and the generally frenzied, of ten dangerous, activity as caravans are formed or broken up. However, not counting the everpassing confusion of the High Road and the Way of the Dra-gon-watching those thoroughfares is itself a spectator sport of long tradition-the most interesting of all these open spaces is Virgin's Square.

This space is, of course, not a square at all, but roughly round in shape. Waterdeep's womenfolk often come here to gasp at and give the eye to sinister-looking men from all over Faerun who swagger about Virgin's Square fully armed, hoping to attract

Whenever magic is unleashed, it will go wild on a roll of 4 or 8 on a d12.

mercenary employment. Here Blazidon One-Eye sits on a crate most days, matching hireswords with employers.

The square is named for a local legend that tells of virgin men and women being sacrificed long ago to dragons on this site, before there even was a City of Waterdeep. Some Sword Coast barbarian tribes do have legends of a Dragon God that keep them from raiding Waterdeep, where great dragons are said to lair on Mount Waterdeep. According to these folk, if they ever fall under the gaze of the Waterdeep dragons, the wyrms will come devouring among them to make up for all  
the virgins not given to them down the ages since the nomadic barbarians stopped coming here. Interestingly, there are much newer legends in the city of dragon hoards hidden somewhere in Mount Waterdeep, and still not recovered by either the city guard, which inhabits caverns and passages in the mountain, linked to Castle Waterdeep, or the smugglers who use buried Skullport, below.

There is yet more lore linked to Virgins Square. A mimic once somehow reached it and took the shape of a statue. It remained undetected for two winters until the continuing disappearances of

street drunks in the square on every dark night prompted an investigation. The statue seemed strangely unfamiliar to the sculptor who had fashioned itand a sewer beside it was discovered to be completely filled (to a depth of over 60 feet) with the real statue-covered by a huge heap of bones!

This was after two of the city watch, not really expecting to find anything amiss, carelessly prodded the statue with their spears, and in response, it reached out and ate them.

Take a careful look at all the statues you pass, I guess. I'll look at the alleyways of this ward later, after I tell you about some of the buildings here.

### Homes

### The Snookery

This is the house of the noted Captain-at-Arms (weapons tutor) Myrmith Splendon. ${ }^{22}$ It's a rambling old place with stone walls and barred windows. Its exterior doors are covered with plating  
made from old armor, hammered flat. From inside, there is often a muted din similar to the sounds of a foundry, as Myrmith's students repair weapons they have damaged, or modify those they wield, or simply use them on each other. Some have been known to practice the knack of driving an adamantine sword through armor plate for days.

Here Myrmith trains all who can pay his steep fees in advance ${ }^{23}$ in the use of weaponry of all sorts; he has mastered an amazing variety of weapons and has specimens of them all here for daily use.

Those planning on robbing Myrmith's house are warned that no one knows just what he does with his gold, that the snooks (griffon-like animated stone statues, something like gargoyles) which adorn the roof of the house are intelligent and formidable guardians. Not only would robbers have to contend with the snooks, but at least seven magical flying daggers ${ }^{24}$ also steadfastly guard the place.

[^0]
[^0]: ${ }^{22}$ Location \#170 on the color map.  
    ${ }^{23}$ Myrmith can use any weapon the DM desires and can train a character in the use of it thoroughly or assist warriors in improving their overall battle skills enough to allow them to advance a level in expertise. His fees are $190 \mathrm{gp} /$ level per week. His skill is such that training, even when the house is full of students learning simultaneously, will take the minimum time necessary.  
    ${ }^{24}$ As Myrmith's wizard friends are continually experimenting with and improving on the snooks, the DM is free to improve upon the powers of a gargoyle in any way desired. All snooks (there are at least 6 active at all times) are LN in alignment, and unshakably loyal to Myrmith. Even magic cannot turn them against him.

    Flying daggers are fully detailed on page 115 of the Campaign Guide to Undermountain book (in the Ruins of Undermountain boxed set). Myrmith's version of these self-animated flying weapons are AC5; MV Fl21 (A); HD 1+1; hp 9; THAC0 17; \#AT 2; Dmg 1-4; get no attack bonuses but are considered +2 magical weapons for purposes of what they can hit; cannot be affected by any type of magical or psionic control except by Myrmith; and are immune to magic missile spells and all lightning or electrical-based magic, which they reflect back $100 \%$ on the source!

### Shops

### Aurora's Realms Shop "High Road" Catalogue Counter

This is the Trades Ward outlet of the famous Faerun-wide all goods retail chain. Located on the northwest corner of the meeting of the Street of the Tusks and the High Road, this shop has six guards (shifts of three and three), a stout, motherly matron of a counter clerk named Orgula Samshroon, and a tall, kindly service-mage called Dhaunryl Zalimbar.

### Belmonder's Meats

### 555

This shop is always busy. From when the place opens at dawn to when it closes at dusk, the four counter clerks and five butchers here are kept hopping chopping and wrapping meat for all they're worth to satisfy the endless lines of customers crowding in for fresh meat. By far the most popular meat counter in the city; Belmonder's has two side counters: one sells skewers of sizzle-cooked meat scraps (a popular walking meal for those one the go) and the other sells whole sides of meat to buyers for inns, other eateries, noble families, and wealthy folk. At night, a security force of 20 experienced and well-equipped hireswords guards the unloading  
of meat wagons. A meat wagon arriving in the city is escorted to a warehouse by a city watch patrol and/or a member of the Guild of Butchers. The night runs from warehouses to the various butcher shops have similar escorts.

There are tales of corpses found hanging on hooks in the ice chambers here and murdered men delivered packed in the wagons with the other meat under the ice and straw, but the throngs of shoppers love the place and have never been put off by such outrageous whispers. Smoked and well-aged sides are brought in from Belmonder's own estates northeast of the city near Rassalantar. The butchers will also cut up a carcass for you if you bring one in. This task takes about 20 minutes and costs $3-10 \mathrm{gp}$, depending on the size and difficulty of the job. ${ }^{25}$

Proprietor: The proprietor, Morathin "Hooks" Belmonder, is a burly hearty man with a strong stomach and a good eye for meat. He is Second Knife of, and public contact for, the Guild of Butchers.

### The Golden Horn Gambling House

### 55555

This ornately gilded palace of gleaming black polished marble stands on the east side of Snail Street, dominating the curve

[^0]
[^0]: ${ }^{25}$ Location \#188 on the color map.

where it sweeps sharply east near its northern end. ${ }^{26}$

I could barely see inside this place-and what I could see was red and plush: red carpet, red sofas, red cushions, dancing girls wearing sheer red silk gowns (that were high cut and low cut!), and even a red-painted ceiling.

The lamplight is kept dim, I suspect, to hide as much of the cheating from the customers as possible. If any notice and object, the 16 bodyguards in the place converge like thirsty stirges, and the disturbance is quickly and quietly removed.

My advice to those who don't enjoy losing great sums of money is to stick to the four-hand card and dice games where you play against the house and three other patrons. And try to find out early on which one of the other patrons is the house antic (undercover agent)! It's worth one visit, just to be overwhelmed by all the red coziness-and to see the sensual dancing.

If you do win big-once a year or so someone does, I'm toldyou'll have the mystery contents of the golden horn, which hangs above the huge open hearth, added to your winnings. But be careful: I expect the horn holds coins treated with a slow-acting paralyzing agent or a polymorphed monster, so these folks can quietly get their money back!

Proprietor: The Golden Horn's proprietor, Hahstoz Baerhuld, is a dark, silent, expressionless man who seems to glide silently around the place.

### Thentavva's Boots

### 11111

This old, narrow shop on Vellarr's Lane is adorned with the carved stone images of frolicking nymphs and pegasi. ${ }^{27}$ Inside, the crowded interior smells strongly of leather. Here a man considered by some to be the best cobbler in Waterdeep makes custom footwear for all.

His thigh-high, sleek, pointedtoed ladies' boots are famous and eagerly sought after, even at the steep price of 10 gp and the waiting period of at least nine days, but the shop is also full of slippers, walking boots, and the like. Thentavvan work is of the best quality, known for lasting many years and surviving mud and wet well.

Proprietor: Thurve Thentavva, the cobbler supreme and proprietor of Thentavva's Boots, is calm, bespectacled, and unflappable.

### Orsabbas's Fine Imports

### 11111

Here you can pay far too much money for things you never

expected to see on sale in a shop things from far away in Faerun. This shop caters to the homesick, with perfumed hangings from Calimshan, a spear from Tethyr adorned with the skull of a royal family member, rock rubble from Mirabar, and much, much more.

Nobles needing costumes for feasts often come here to rent or buy authentic pirate garb from the Sea of Fallen Stars, barbarian furs from the far, frozen North, silken robes from Thay, and even Bedine robes and headgarb from the depths of Anauroch. Others come for disguises.

This shop, on Vellarr's Lane just east of the Street of the Tusks, ${ }^{28}$ is entered up a steep flight of stone steps. The main floor of the shop, a dozen feet above the street, is adorned with a large, arched window inset with a border of varicolored glass. At night, it  
glows slightly due to powerful spells on it that deflect all missiles and blows, preventing its breakage.

Inside, the observant visitor will notice a curious sight on the windowsill: a scattering of small, knobby bones, yellowed with age. They are a legacy of Waterdeep's more lawless days, when most thieves snatched by night, rather than wore guild livery and stole by contract and moneylending.

There was a scything blade trap built into the sill of this window. The trap may still function when set. The present proprietor will not say though he will talk about the bones.

The window's excellent location as a means of entry resulted in more than one late-night scream. On many a morning, the shopkeeper would get up, draw his sword, go downstairs to unset the trap, and open the window-

[^0]

only to find the remnants of an unlucky or unskilled thief's hand there on the sill.

Orsabbas fills special orders (where customers request specific items from certain places), but the fees are steep, and the wait may be long-as long as an entire season in some cases.

Proprietor: Ildar "the Duke of Darkness" Orsabbas is the proprietor. His nickname comes from the masked, sinister guise he wears to nobles' feasts.

### Riautar's Weaponry

### 11111

This shop fronts on the High Road just east of the Street of the Tusks ${ }^{29}$ and is crowded with an assortment of ready weaponry; most of it secondhand. It is notable as the source of the best arrows, bowstrings, and long bows in Waterdeep, made on the premises by the owner. Their superlative workmanship is admired and coveted by all archers who see them.

A relic of Waterdeep's past can also be seen on the roof of this shop. The crouching, fanged female figure with the spread wings is not a carved ornament, but a petrified harpy. She dates from the long-ago War of Five Wizards, when five mages battled their way across the city in one terrible night, vying for  
supremacy in the Wizards' Guild of the time-and destroying most of the city in the process.

This harpy, along with two others, was teleported to Waterdeep from afar by one of the wizards, and another wizard promptly petrified them all. The other two harpies plunged to the street below. There they shattered-and crushed the wizard who had summoned them. It is rumored that some mage in the city frees this harpy to fly-and kill, at his command-from time to time, and then forces her back into her customary pose and stone shape, but this has never been proven to be more than a flight of fancy.

Proprietor: Zarondar "the Nimble" Riautar, public contact for the Fellowship of Bowyers and Fletchers, is the proprietor.

### The Riven Shield Shop

### 1111

This shop is famous up and down the Sword Coast for its large and varied assortment of secondhand arms and armorincluding many famous relics of fallen or retired adventurers. The most famous items are either not for sale, or command very high prices (thousands of gold pieces). There are, however, many serviceable, unhistoried used weapons here, from tiny daggers used

![img-101.jpeg](assets/Volo's%20Guide%20To%20Waterdeep_img-101.jpeg)  
by noble ladies to the heavy broadswords favored by barbarians, that are useful to anyone in need of a weapon. Scores of these sell each day. ${ }^{30}$

No one is tempted to steal the more valuable pieces. It is widely known that some of the magical shields hanging from the rafter beams contain magically imprisoned monsters that can be  
released to fight as an ally of the shield-wearer. It is also well known that one of the items in the shop (no one is quite sure which one, and the proprietor neglects to say) is an alert, always vigilant, sentinel.

Proprietor: Delborggan the Blade runs the Riven Shield Shop. He is a grizzled, one-eyed exadventurer.

[^0]
[^0]: ${ }^{30}$ Location \#169 on the color map. Currently, the shop holds such wonders as the Horrible Hammer of War (functions like a vampiric ring of regeneration); the Spear of Lochal, which has some strange magical powers and is believed to be only a part of a larger, more powerful magic item; the Helm of Bolarr, which allows its wearer to see even in pitch darkness and with infravision - and to perceive any foe struck by the helm-wearer within the last turn, who is still within 400 yards of the helm, even if the foe is invisible, disguised by magic, has changed form, or is hidden behind a solid barrier; the Shield of Many Meteors, which attracts and harmlessly absorbs all fireballs, minute meteors, and similar fire magic effects into itself); and many others. The Horrible Hammer of War was wielded by the half-ogre Klarargh Skullbold, leader of the adventuring band known as Wrath Rampant, until he was slain by the city guard while trying to set fire to a tavern in Dock Ward.

### Saern's Fine Swords

### 䍐䍐䍐

This shop stands on the southeastern corner of the meeting of the High Road and Burnt Wagon Way. ${ }^{31}$ It's an old, massively built stone place with bars on all the windows, crenelations on the flagstone roof, and a narrow exposed, iron-bound door overlooked by arrow slits-in short, a miniature fortress.

It holds a large stock of swords, including a few made by Szwarharba the Swordsmith, the famous craftsman of Tethyr, who before his death some 90 winters back had learned how to forge blades that could be bent around almost in a circle without breaking or becoming permanently angled out of true. Swords are not made to fit the user here, but they are sharpened (including overall lightening by shaving the blade thickness). The large selection means that most shoppers will be able to find a sword that is reasonably suitable to their reach and strength. A good long sword costs about 20 gp , including the 1 gp city fee, and a fine dagger about 4 gp .

Piergeiron has a deal with the proprietor of this shop: Should the city militia ever need to be called up quickly and reinforced with volunteers needing arms, the city guard will empty the  
shop of arms, take it over as a rallying post, and pay the owner (who will be allowed to stay in residence with his staff if he desires) 90,000 pieces of gold on the spot.

Few clients know the quietly polite owner of the shop is a warrior, and fewer still know he has invisible weapons stashed all over the shop in plain view ready to defend himself with. One is a sword of dancing and another is a sword +4 , defender. The shop has at least three staff on duty at all times-one of whom is an out-of-uniform city guard officer, who notes the names and descriptions of those who buy particular weapons.

Proprietor: Zygarth "Slayer" Saern runs Saern's Fine Swords. He is a tall, gaunt, smiling man who can tell the age, quality, and condition of steel at a glance.

### Taverns

### Felzoun's Folly

### 䍐䍐 808

This many-windowed tavern is a noisy crowded, casual place, where many merchants and shoppers grab a quick tankard and a bite. Its exterior presents an awning-festooned, three-story face on the northwestern corner where the mouth of River Square opens into Salabar Street. ${ }^{32}$

A bite here means a sausage roll or chicken-and-cheese pasty augmented by fresh asparagus with melted butter (when in season) or fresh whole oysters. Those with strong stomachs eat oysters raw here by tradition. The standard fare costs 4 sp each-a real bargain. The seasonal delicacies are $6 \mathrm{sp} /$ plate.

There's little variety in drink here. Ale is $1 \mathrm{sp} /$ tankard, stout is 2 sp , and wine and zzar are both $4 \mathrm{sp} /$ tallglass. There are usually six white wines to be had, including sweet Neverwinter Nectar, and three reds.

I've heard rumors that stolen  
goods can be fenced here, but could learn nothing more. ${ }^{33}$ In all the din and confusion, I suspect wholesale wars could be fought here, with no one the wiser!

Proprietor: Felzoun Thar, the bristle-bearded, fearless dwarven host, is always bustling busily about the Folly.

when taking accommodation in Trades Ward. This inn is by no means an exception to that practical expectation.

Located on the north side of the High Road, just west of where it begins to bend westwards to meet Waterdeep Way, this inn rises five full floors above the street. It is large and well-appointed. ${ }^{34}$ And for the money being asked, it should be-the rate is $6 \mathrm{gp} /$ room per night!

No meals are included, but there's house wine and hot water for baths. A copper sitting-tub is provided in each room, as well as a-noisy!-stoppered floor drain. Well-tended tabling is also part of the room fee.

Proprietor: Torst Urlivan, the proprietor, is a tall, withdrawn, dignified man who dresses as if he were the wealthiest noble, but smells strongly of horse.

### Gondalim's

### 䍃䍃 䍃䍃䍃

This large, comfortable old inn stands in the angle where Winter Path and Burnt Wagon Way both meet with the High Road. ${ }^{35}$ It's a worn but comfortable place, and because of its massive construction, it's also very quiet. You'll seldom hear noises from other guests at night.

Rooms vary from 2-7 gp/night,  
depending on the size and amenities. The top-priced rooms are actually large suites, sleeping up to 10 people in comfort. In all cases, stabling and dawnfry-or morningfeast, as they call it more formally here-are included. In all, it is a nice place to stay and very central.

When crossing the lobby between the room stairs and the dining room, observant visitors may see a dark stain on the door leading to the kitchens-as if something spattered against it just above halfway up and ran down it to the floor. The stain isn't poor housekeeping. Some 70 winters ago, the princess Shaerglynda of Tethyr was murdered on that spot.

She died from a swordthrust that pinned her to the door-and the dark stain was left by her life's blood. It can't be cleaned away and it never fades or disappears. Even when the door is replaced-and it has been, at least twice-the bloodstain slowly reappears by itself.

Proprietress: Shulmeira Gondalim is the proprietress. She is the granddaughter of the founder. She is a short, slim, unspectacular but charming woman of young age. She presides with quiet expertise over a staff of old, large, stoop-shouldered and shuffling, but calmly capable, servant women.

### The Grey Serpent

### 䍐䍐䍐 66666

This sleek, fairly new expensive and high-class establishment stands on the east side of the Way of the Dragon, not far north from its intersection with Drakiir Street. ${ }^{36}$ Rooms here are a stiff 6 gp per night (single or double), but the furnishings are so clean and luxurious that this place outshines some noble villas I've seen! Stabling and very fine house wine, but no food, is included in the room fee.

By special arrangement, apprentices of the Launderers' Guild and the Order of Master Taylors are always on hand to whisk garments away for cleaning, alterations, or repairs. This is a cool, private place-but truly the lap of luxury.

Proprietor: Orlpiir Hammerstar runs the Grey Serpent. He's a man with dwarven blood in his past, I was told. However, when I met him, he appeared very tall, thin, and austere, with a cultured voice and a beaky nose. The dwarven blood must be rather far back in his ancestry.

### The Unicorn's Horn

### 䍐䍐䍐 6666

This fairly new inn occupies the most strategic location in Water-  
deep: the northeast corner where the High Road meets Waterdeep Way and turns north. ${ }^{37}$ As you might expect, room fees are as high as a halfling after several kegs: 10 gp to 25 gp per night! There's even an Imperial Suite of rooms on the top floor (the sixth) that costs 40 gp per night. Its windows command magnificent views of the city on three sides.

The furnishings are opulent, but not very tasteful. Huge tapestries and heavily gilded, massive pieces of furniture are everywhere. The canopied beds are the only comfortable place to sit in the entire inn.

Servants carry your bags, stable your mounts for you, bring a light evening meal with wine to your room, and hot spiced wine and hot water for a bath in the morning-but that's the extent of the service. There's a locked, guarded warehouse for wagons, carts, and coaches available as part of the room fee.

All in all, it is impressive, but not relaxing, or worth the money. Stay somewhere cheaper, and go to a nobles' feast if you want to be overwhelmed with haughty luxury instead.

Proprietor: Quendever Ilistrym owns and runs this inn. He is a haughty effete man of excellent cheekbones and breeding, but little energy or competence that I could see.

### AlLeys

Trades Ward's alleys are crowded, of ten highly scented passages usually crammed with garbage, delivered and stored goods, or just empty crates. They are always busy and may not offer much faster travel than the larger streets they wind among. Many a brawler has found that close quarters here prevent the use of a favorite but large weapon or can cause an inglorious collapse of boxes on top of himself!

### Atkiss Alley

### 88

This short passage links Quaff Alley with Virgin's Square. Many men habitually slip through here in livery or finery. Cutpurses sometimes lurk here to prey on them, but city watch patrols are quite frequent.

### Blackhorn Alley

### 88

The northernmost of the passages cutting through the city blocks that stand between the High Road and the Way of the Dragon, this alleyway is named for a long-dead cobbler of some note, Alsible Blackhorn, who lived on it. Today it is a constant haunt of brown rats big enough to make a (disgusting) meal of and some poor folk do just that, hunting them with clubs and hurled, empty crates.

### Brindul Alley

### 8888

This crescent-shaped alley lies between Sorn Street and River Street. It is the frequent haunt of a dangerous apparition-one more often encountered near the docks in older days, but seen here since a few winters ago: the Hand That Sings.

The Hand has been seen more than once in Brindul Alley or floating in the ways nearby. It is an animated human hand with a mouth in its palm. The strange apparition all too similar to the sign of cursed Moander, the ancient and evil god who never sleeps quite soundly enough.  
![img-104.jpeg](assets/Volo's%20Guide%20To%20Waterdeep_img-104.jpeg)

---

The Hand is said to snatch valuables it fancies-especially magic-when it encounters them, and to occasionally attack folk in the darkness, strangling them or tripping them into fatal falls. Most often, though, it seems to take no notice of those who do not bother or follow it, merely drifting along, eerily singing old and fragmentary Sword Coast ballads and love songs as it wanders through the night. ${ }^{38}$

### Chelor's Alley

This short passage runs due west from the Court of the White Bull. Lit each night by many lamps set in the windows of the upstairs home of the man it is named for (a merchant who just loves candles), it is used as a rendezvous by those who need light enough to read by (to check maps or contracts, for instance), and by city watch and city guard patrols who need to examine evidence.

### Dark Alley

This narrow winding passage runs east off Buckle Street, just south of, and parallel to, River Street. Overshadowed by tall buildings on all sides, it is gloomy even at highsun and is pitch dark  
by night-a favorite mugging spot, used by half a dozen or more local thugs at once. Not a place to go near after dusk.

### Deloun Alley

Reached from Chelor's Alley, this back-of-the-shops delivery route is always crowded with crates, barrels, and the like. By night, rats of both the human and rodent sort lurk here, where crates can easily be toppled onto, or to block the escape of, surprised victims.

### Hunters' Alley

This narrow passage runs east from the Way of the Dragon. It continues the route of Soothsayers' Way. It is named for two brave brothers who roamed the Realms when yet young. One became a lore lord of the Realms, and the other currently aspires to dukedom. As in their company, those who traverse this way generally have a wild but ultimately safe journey.

### Lathin's Cut

This short passage links the Plinth and Jelabril Street to the High

[^0]
[^0]: ${ }^{38}$ Statistics of the Hand that Sings are left to the DM. It is suggested that the Hand be based on the undead crawling claw (see the monster of that name in Volume 3 of the Monstrous Compendium). It will wield any magic items it can hold, and has a whimsical personality-quick to anger and attack, but not vindictive. It does not hold grudges.

Road. It is named for the man who leveled his own house to create it for the greater convenience of the devout. Both citizens and visitors used it as a landmark shortcut, and rendezvous.

### Mhaer's Alley

This short passage has grown into a proper street that links Wall Way along the southern edge of the City of the Dead with Spendthrift Alley. It has the greatest concentration of shops in the city where you can buy thread, cord, rope, wire, and trimmings for clothing.

### Spendthrift Alley

### 111

This former alley long ago grew into a major local street, but retained the feature that created its name: the ongoing bazaar of stalls and street vendors, selling everything cheap. This shoppers' gift from the gods never closes. By night, this route is brilliantly lit, and the trading goes on. The place to go for small trifles, buttons, laces, and whatever you can't find elsewhere. It is apt to be crowded. Beware thieves.

### Quaff Alley

### 11

Stretching west from Atkiss Alley to the rear of the Golden Horn  
gambling house, this short passage is named for its traditional use by drunkards, who drink here until they pass out, and snore the night away. In winter, the city watch spreads straw here for burrow-ing-bedding, to keep these unfortunates from freezing to death. Many a thief or adventurer has hidden among it temporarily.

### Quill Alley

### 111

Now a proper street, this passage is the traditional neighborhood of scribes, cartographers, and clerks. It is named for the feathers that most people of letters use as pens. You can still hire many here.

The visitor will see many exterior staircases winding up and down the sides of the rickety old buildings along this lane. Children love to play among them, and so, by night, do thieves.

### Spoils Alley

A behind-the-shops way running westerly from the southernmost end of Quill Alley, this innocentlooking passage is where the Thieves' Guild of old used to divide up the street takings of a nights work. Now it's a boxlittered backwater-but it still used for shady meetings. It's an especially good place to change clothing or don a disguise.

Theln Lane  
$J$  
This short cut-through links Irimar's Walk with Andamaar's Street at the north end of Trades Ward. It's an echoing, bare passage overhung by balconies where hard currency girls dwell, lowering rope ladders to clients. Theln was a "businessman" who lived and died long ago in one of the buildings on this alleyway.

### Tsarnen Alley

$D$  
Running east off the Way of the Dragon to Burdag Lane just  
north of the Plinth, this passage and Lathin's Cut provide a shortcut through the blocks of buildings. Thieves often preyed upon the traffic here in older daysbut Tsarnen the ranger made it his business to bodily dispose of them in a quite unpleasant manner one summer before the Thieves' Guild was overthrown. (Tsarnen had had a very bad expience with muggers early in life.) The thieves moved to safer hunting grounds after a short time. These days, with Tsarnen long in his grave, the passage is not quite as safe, but watch patrols and, by day pilgrims and priests pass along it often.

### Tuckpurse Alley

This alleyway runs east and south from the eastern end of Spendthrift Alley, linking it to the easternmost end of Vellarr's Lane. By night, it's very dark and a favorite working ground for thugs, some of whom use children to trip or snatch at passersby. There's a very large rain barrel partway along this alley just behind Thond Glass \& Glazing that you should beware of. Its gutter was diverted long ago, and it is used by thugs who crouch inside it, watching for prey through knotholes.

### Urcandle Alley

### $\int$

This short passage links the Court of the White Bull with Sorn Street. Urcandle was a person (just who has been forgotten), but today this alleyway is where you'll find ropes, cables, harness, reins, drovers' whips, spare wagon wheels, and the like for sale. If your cart or wagon needs a spare, part, this is the place to look, There are other places in the city that sell such items (notably in South Ward), but the shops along this route have the greatest concentration of such vendors in one area.
