### The ProvenJer

The menu at the Dripping Dagger is typical for a good inn, and I've reproduced it in full here (page 113). I would hope that those planning to open their own establishments elsewhere will take their measure of its simple breadth and prices!

### The People

The proprietor is Filiare, a jovial, middle-aged ex-mercenary who's Blazidon One-Eye's chief competitor in the business of getting mercenaries hired. Many folk come here seeking hireswords in a hurry and Filiare is known to all and trusted by most. He has lots of spare weapons and gear given to him by fighting men who never came back or who paid him in goods when they lacked coin, which he will sell or rent to adventurers. He has also known to trim his prices a bit for guests thin in the purse.

Filiare presides over a staff of four waitresses, four chambermaids, six kitchenfolk, and four hostlers (in the stable behind).

### The Prices

Food prices are as given on the menu. A room rents for $5 \mathrm{sp} /$ day from highsun to highsun, with stabling included, or $20 \mathrm{sp} /$  
tenday. Bedroll (bunking on the floor of the attic with others) is 1 $\mathrm{sp} /$ night. A bowl of soup, a mug of ale, and a round loaf of bread are included with bedroll service.

### Travelers' Lore

Many famous mercenaries and companies have stayed here while in Waterdeep. By common consent, the inn is neutral ground where rivals and sworn enemies stay amicably-or at least tolerantly-together. Before they built their own keep (since destroyed), the Company of Crazed Venturers lived here, and it was always their favorite place to drink. Longtime regulars still talk about the time they used a wish spell to teleport back from disaster in a nearby dungeon and shattered the bar with their arrival. Unfortunately they appeared without any of their equipment-and closely followed by their teleporting foes! (If you should meet with a former member of the Company this is not a good topic to discuss.)

Many other tales are linked to the Dripping Dagger, but I'll tell only one other. Alusair Nacacia, princess of Cormyr, when still a slip of a girl, gave her lady attendants and guards the slip while her father was meeting with Piergeiron. She wandered in here and was happily playing with the warriors in the taproom while the city watch and city guard were frantically turning the city

upside down searching for her and dreading having to report her disappearance to Khelben to get magical aid in tracing her whereupon her father was sure to hear of her disappearance. After the Daggers patrons had mock-wrestled with her, tossed her from hand to hand until she was quite winded, let her sip strong things that she'd always been forbidden to taste, and disarmed her and showed her how to do it to someone else, they were in the midst of showing her how to throw daggers when the city watch came in. It's a good thing the watch's lead officer was swift-Alusair had just flung a dagger at the battered inside of  
the front door when he opened it. The most astonishing thing, he remarked later, was that no one in the Dagger knew that she was a princess.

Her fathers later dry comment was that the most astonishing thing (to him) was the number of unsuitable jokes and sayings she'd learned in a brief hour or so. Her lifelong habit of muttering "Stop me vitals!" under her breath comes from this childhood visit to the Inn of the Dripping Dagger. When she turned up missing much later in life, the first place Cormyrean agents in Waterdeep were ordered to check was (of course) the Inn of the Dripping Dagger.
