# The People

The Mermaid has a busy staff of over 20 very efficient, hardworking maids who frequently give personal attentions to the needs of guests. They get to keep any tips tossed their way, and also get a percentage of all the Mermaid's earnings. A seven-foot-tall, muscular blonde of northern barbarian stock named Reetha is widely known around the city as is an agile lass from the jungles of Chult, Leilatha Subraira, who is covered from head to toes in tattoos and likes to oil her skin to keep them colorful and herself hard to grab.

The pleasant atmosphere of the Mermaid is an enforced  
serenity. Patrons and staff are guarded against rowdiness and violence by the watchful eye and ready spells of the proprietress, Lady Alathene Moonstar. The secret panels can only be opened by her hand-or by four magical hands fashioned of silver, enchanted by her and carried by staff members on security duty. If one goes missing, she alters the pass spells within a few hours.

Lady Alathene is old and very beautiful, her beauty kept up by magic. She glides silently around the Mermaid dressed in full formal gowns with ornate, upthrust bodices and head veils, often wearing the same sort of facemask as her staff.

She is quick to use her magic, and fearless when facing down even drunken mages-I saw her employ disabling spells I've seen nowhere else, harmlessly confining a belligerent drunkard without injury to him or to the surroundings.

### The Prices

Rooms are 3 gp to 9 gp per night (larger rooms and lower floors are dearer), or 10 gp to 50 gp per tenday. Most are 5 gp per night or 20 gp per tenday. Scents of your choice, fresh linen as needed, and unlimited, sparkling clear, scented bath water (obviously procured from elsewhere or  
magically cleaned) are all included in these prices.

Tipping is common. Some regular visitors give a standard 1 gp/day extra and ask that it be shared among the staff, as well as giving extras to those escorts who see to them personally.

### Travelers' Lore

There are several pleasant stories, probably pure legend, about men and mermaids falling in love with each other in the pool and leaving either land or water with the help of the young man's magic, or the help of a friendly wizard, to be together.

The custom of the Hour of

---

Darkness provides many amusing tales and naughty pranks. In the early hours of each morning, all lights in public areas of the Mermaid are extinguished, and aside from the silver hands carried by the staff, which give off a blue-silver glow like moonlight gleaming on a sword, everyone has to find their way about by feeling. This custom causes much laughter.

In addition, there are darker whispers-of guests sometimes vanishing in the Mermaid, never to be heard of again. These tales seem to be linked to a circular staircase rising from the central mermaid pool hall to a glasscovered rooftop garden or cupola, where herbs and flowers are grown. It is adorned with bones bound to its rails and risers with fine wire. ${ }^{43}$

[^0]![img-155.jpeg](assets/Volo's%20Guide%20To%20Waterdeep_img-155.jpeg)

[^0]: ${ }^{43}$ Elminster tells us the tales of disappearing guests are true-and are due to the Lady Alathene Moonstar, an archlich whose unlife is maintained by faulty, failing enchantments. She keeps to the Mermaid because she likes to see young lively folk having fun around her (and by magic, keeps a close watch on their activities).

    Although she is seen by the Lords of the city as a force for good (sometimes sending word to Piergeiron about illicit deals and doings that she overhears in the Mermaid), she is forced to maintain her unlife by draining the life forces of living, intelligent beings (two to three a year). She must do this by direct bodily contact, and usually chooses to so use guests she dislikes or sees as evil. Their bones end up on the staircase.

    Her family, the noble Moonstars of Waterdeep, knows all about her, but keeps quiet about it. In public, she ignores them and they ignore her, but privately she helps in the training of young Moonstars with magical talent and also provides safekeeping for certain treasures and incriminating items for the family. (For more details of Lady Moonstar, see the "Folk of Waterdeep" appendix at the end of this book.)

### The Copper Cup

Tavern, Inn, \& Festhall

### 1999 DOD GG

The Copper Cup is one of the busiest and most famous places in Dock Ward, a must-see spot for many visitors. A large, roaring, many-leveled barn of a place, the Cup is a tavern, inn, and festhall, all in one. It opens off the Southyard, just inside the city's South Gate, and is easily reached by the High Road or the Way of the Dragon, and easily fled from down Smugglers' Run alleyway. ${ }^{44}$ Travelers overwhelmed by the size and bustle of the City of Splendors can easily find the Cup, get much Waterdeep offers without ever leaving it, and boast when they get home of having stayed at one of the wildest places in the notorious Dock Ward!

### The Place

The Cup goes several cellars deep as well as four-in some places five-floors up. It is actually three linked old, converted warehouses built tall and massive of dressed stone with outside catwalks and back alley ladders.

The cellars are prone to flooding, and reek of mildew. Except for dumping carrion and garbage, they are little used. All of the floors above, though, are used the day and night round-so  
much that the old floorboards often shake from all the bustling.

### The Prospect

As an inn, the Cup is pretty poor. A patrons stay is ruled by constant noise. The Cup is always busy with festhall traffic in the halls and vacant rooms at all hours. It's a lousy place to try to get some sleep.

The Cup is rescued by its services. Everything is available for a price, from having boots mended to mating riding stallions. If the staff people personally don't provide it, they have standing arrangements with someone who will.

As a tavern, the Cup has an ever-changing clientele, and no quiet places for intimate talk, haggling, or involved planning unless you rent a room. It does have cheap, plentiful, and fairly bad (watered down) ale, as well as good (but expensive!) wine, sold by the bottle.

As a festhall, the Cup is one long, ongoing party. It's not a place to visit and remain unseen or to relax and stretch-its where one goes to romp. The dancers are acrobatic and expert contortionists. Their common costume is little more than a sheen of sweat!

### The Provender

Most food at the Cup is order in. It is brought up to your room

![img-156.jpeg](assets/Volo's%20Guide%20To%20Waterdeep_img-156.jpeg)  
from other places in the city at their prices plus 1 cp per dish for the runners of the Cup to bring it to you, hot, through the streets.

Ale costs $1 \mathrm{cp} /$ tankard. Dark ale (the good stuff) is double that. Wine goes for 2 sp to $3 \mathrm{gp} /$ bottle, depending on quality and scarcity Good vintages are about 1 $\mathrm{gp} /$ bottle.

The Cup's kitchens are famous for two things: hot fish chowder, that tastes mainly of pepper and old beer ( 2 sp for a large wooden bowl), and cinnamon butter toast ( $1 \mathrm{cp} /$ plate of six hot, dripping slices). The cinnamon butter toast is much favored by everyone who samples it for after the fest light dining.

The company of the Cup's beauteous and well-trained companions (of either gender) costs 10 gp per evening or any part of it. These escorts know the City well, can play most games  
ably and know how to have a good time.

### The People

Few know that the Cup is owned and run by six of its dancers: Vivaelia Sunder, Evethe Untuk, Yululee Lantannar, and Jhandril Neth (the females), and Ilintar Belereth and Tiirlon Windstar (the males).

They take turns dancing, renting out as escorts, and tending bar with their large staff, and seem to love the life they've built.

### The Prices

Rooms can be had for 1 gp to 7 gp per night (larger rooms and lower floors are dearer) or 10 gp to 40 gp per tenday. Most are 2 gp per night or 15 gp per tenday.

Linen is changed daily and the fee buys a single scented-water bath per night, if one desires, unlimited drinking water, and stabling for one or two animals in a covered and constantly attended stable. Additional beasts are $1 \mathrm{gp} /$ night each.

### Travelers' Lore

Every visitor to this ongoing party has their own favorite tale of goings-on at the Cup, whether it's leaping from table to table or wilder pursuits, but this place has no hidden plots or deeds (or does it? I did see a lot of folk slipping down towards the cellars …).

### Other Places of Interest in Dock Ward

### Shops

### Red Sails Warehouse

### 䍿䍿䍿

This warehouse offers rental space to all, no questions asked. Material to be stored can't be alive or flammable. Space is $1 \mathrm{cp} /$ day per longbox. The longboxes are more or less coffin sized.

Empty cubicles of up to two longboxes deep and eight high are available-multiply the fee accordingly. If cooling is needed, ice and watching costs an extra 2 $\mathrm{cp} /$ day per longbox.

Proprietor: The proprietor, Orblaer Thrommox, is fat, bearded, and very strong. ${ }^{45}$

### Gelfuril the Trader

as coinage. Much of his wares are old or heavily used, but his prices are very reasonable. Gelfuril is more than he appears. As locals will tell, he once felled a fleeing thief with a flame strike. ${ }^{46}$

Proprietor: Gelfuril the Trader, the proprietor, is a soft-spoken, stout little man.

### The Rouse of Pride

### 11111

This well-stocked perfume shop carries exotic scents from all over Faerun-from ashes of burnt snowsnake to the musk of the female giant slug. The shop is run by two sisters and is guarded by trained hunting dogs of compact build and extremely loyal temperament.

The House of Pride is crammed with a forest of glass bottles of all sizes, shapes, and hues. It is protected by a special enchantment that prevents glass from breaking. The glass here can still be vaporized or melted, but will not shatter or fall apart. ${ }^{47}$

Proprietresses: The two sisters who run the House of Pride, Arleeth and Ilitel Harmeth, have whimsical senses of humor. The two of them always model several of their wares on various locations on their bodies.

### Aurora's Realms Shop Catalogue Counter

This is the Dock Ward outlet of the famous Faerun-wide all goods retail chain. Located in a nondescript tenement building next door (to the north across a narrow side alley) to the Purple Palace festhall, this shop fronts on Slut Street.

I was unable to learn just who the mage on staff at this shop was. The flint-eyed order clerk would not even volunteer her own name, and as she stood seven feet tall and was more than twice as wide as me, I did not press her for details. She is flanked at the counter by two burly men-at-arms at all times when the shop is open (dawn to dusk), but she overtops even them, and hardly seems to need the bodyguards. ${ }^{48}$

### Taverns

### The Friendly Flounder 199 DOD

This small, unassuming local tavern stands on the west side of Book Street, just across from the mouth of Candle Lane. It serves both good and bad beer, and patrons can get hot buttered blackbread and fried fish with their drinks.

Prices are $1 \mathrm{cp} /$ tankard for flounder beer (the bad stuff, called teethrinse by everyone), 2 $\mathrm{cp} /$ tankard for best and bold ale, and 1 sp for all-one-patron-caneat of fish, with bread $1 \mathrm{cp} /$ loat  
extra. The food is hearty and not over spiced. The few bottles of wine in its cellar are far more pricey-but many Waterdhavians thrive on an affordable daily meal of fry at this drinking spot.

The Friendly Flounders unspectacular fare and modest structure keep it unknown to most visitors to Waterdeep, but it is a real find for no-bother eating.

Proprietor: Eaengul Skullcrown, who owns and runs the Friendly Flounder, is a gentle, balding giant of a man. He's reputed to have a natural talent for seeing the auras of magical items and enchantments. ${ }^{50}$

### The Hanged Man

### 䍐䍐 88888

The Hanged Man is a gathering place for poets, scriveners, writers, calligraphers, and other literary folk, and is a good place to hear a tale. The patrons tend to smoke pipes, snore a lot, and to be hopelessly behind on everyday news. They also tend to be rude and opinionated, but not of the build or temperament to actually engage in physical disputes. A surprisingly good selection of wine is available, as well as all sorts of ales.

Proprietor: Auldenuth Orbrymm is the proprietor. Patrons who come up short on a bar tab are occasionally allowed to work it off by him by beating two of the regulars at a tall tales contest (if they lose, they do dishes). ${ }^{51}$

### The Sleeping Snake

### 䍐䍐 88888

This rowdy place is roughly furnished in hastily mended furniture. The dockhands who drink here spend a lot of time breaking it over each others' heads. There are rumors that a fence of stolen goods can be contacted here-if you can do any business amid the howls and hoots that ring out as human,  
half-elven, and even half-orc wenches dance on the tables. (Some even try to sing!) There is a fine of 1 sp for hitting a dancer with any hurled object. Dancers willing to do more than dance negotiate other fees. The standing joke goes that any snake able to sleep through all this must be very, very dead.

Proprietor: Alard Belaerl, the proprietor, is a tall, gaunt, hatchet-nosed man with an annoying nasal voice. ${ }^{52}$

### The Sleeping Wench

### 䍐䍐 88888

This tavern is a quieter, cheaper alternative to the Sleeping Snake (see above). There's still dancing on the tables and the cheaper sort of drink, but this place has a better class of clientele and background music (of the lutes and toots variety).

I still can't picture anyone sleeping in here unless he were deaf, but it's quiet enough that you can overhear conversations at nearby tables-usually talk of merchant feuds, city gossip, and the worsening state of the Realms in general. ${ }^{53}$

Proprietor: Peldan Thrael, who owns and runs the Sleeping Wench, is middle-aged, of middling height, nondescript, and

mustachioed. Overall, the type who blends well into crowds.

### The Thirsty Throat

### 䍘 8

This tavern is as ramshackle an establishment as its name implies. A merchant described it to me as "a pile of wood taking its own lazy time about falling into the street," and he got it right. All the furniture is crowded together and bolted down.  
"Crowded, dark, and smells of stale beer," I wrote, years ago, on my first visit-and it hasn't changed a bit. What it does have to offer is mediocre beer at low  
prices. A tankard as big as a man's head costs 1 copper piece. Those who like to laugh and brawl tend to go elsewhere. This place is full of quiet men drinking themselves into slumber with a handful of coppers.

The washrooms are interesting. You climb down a ladder into a little antechamber opening right into a harborbound sewer channel. Men climb down one ladder, and ladies down an-other-and end up facing each other in the same room, about an arm's stretch apart. It's an ideal place for exchanging items on the sly, dumping incriminating things into the sewer, or even for

easily getting into Waterdeep's sewer network. ${ }^{54}$

Proprietor: Bulaedo "Fists" Ledgileer, a monstrously fat, toadlike man with forearms as big as the larger hams you'll see for sale down the street, runs the Thirsty Throat. His nickname comes from his habit of knocking men cold with one punch.

### The Bloody Fist

### 11

I suppose this notorious dive is a good example of just how bad a tavern can possibly be. Repeated  
furniture breakage has resulted in only wall benches and a standup elbow bar in the center of the room being left. Wooden mugs have replaced metal, ceramic, and glass vessels, and the beer barrels are chained down to prevent their easy use as missiles.

Drinkers stand herded together like rothe in a pen, snarling and belching, and fights are almost constant. Bullies and angry people come here to pick fights, and a room upstairs is retained for a succession of novice priests of Tempus, who dress broken bones and perform minor healing magics in return

for donations to the war god.  
One local bard, Talashamber of the Flame Tabard, even dubbed this place the Watching Wargod in a sarcastic ditty about the twofisted heroes of Waterdeep, and the nickname has passed into general usage, as in: "Let's drain a few at the Wargod." Men down on their luck can be hired here, but there is little else of interest. ${ }^{55}$

Proprietor: Uglukh Vorl is a half-orc who has been known to yawn in the midst of a full-scale swordfight. He defends himself with a sleep-poisoned, doublebladed battle axe whose central shaft ends in a spear blade.

### INNS

### Warm Beds

### 䍐 䍐

This establishment delivers just what it promises-and little more. Each bed is warmed by three heated stones placed in it before the renter retires. There is hot water available for washing, heated by the bucket beside the same giant hearth that warms the bedstones. Rooms with one to four single beds are available.

This inn has no stabling (most patrons sell their mounts or stable them at a caravan stable in

South Ward), and provides no food of any kind. Quiet is expected after dark, but as long as there's no noise above lowpitched voices, renters can use their rooms for whatever purpose they please (such as conferences or meetings)?

Proprietress: Shalath Lythryn runs Warm Beds. She is kindly, plain, middle-aged, and very, very observant.

### The Blackstar Inn

### 䒠䒠䒠 䒠䒠

This dignified, even haughty inn is like a fortress on the outside, with barred windows, stone walls, and a slate roof. Its lobby has two armed guards, and the four hostlers in the locked stables are also armed.

Fees are high (typically 1 gp per head per night, plus 1 sp per animal stabled), but in return, guests get almost soundproof rooms (a rarity). Each room has a hip-bath, a double bed, water and wine provided for drinking and various pamphlets and chapbooks provided for light reading. Each room also has its own fireplace, albeit with a miserly supply of firewood, and the patrons tend to keep to themselves. A good place to get a long sound sleep. ${ }^{57}$

Proprietress: Asiyra Boldwinter is the proprietress of this  
inn. Her manner is one of uppercrust, noble dignity.

### The Splintered Stair

### 䒠䒠䒠

The entry hall of this room rises up three floors, overlooked by interior balconies linked by elegantly spiraling stairs. Its name comes from a memorable fight between adventurers, 20 winters ago, in which the fury of wielded blades left one stair damaged almost beyond repair. I love the opulent entry hall, but …

The stair has been replaced, but little else has been done to make guests welcome. The large, luxurious rooms are cold and dark, and chamber pots provide the only sanitary facilities. Rates are $1 \mathrm{gp} /$ night for a person and mount or 5 $\mathrm{sp} /$ night for a person only. Extra animals, and extra persons sharing the same room, are 4 sp each. ${ }^{58}$

Proprietress: Shalanna Duthmere is a pale, worn-looking lady from Daggerford who directs her six daughters in running the inn. She is a widow and is very tight with money.

### The Rearing Hippocampus

many caravan masters and by merchants who want a good, secure place to sleep without announcing their arrival to observant eyes in better wards.

Adorned with a life-sized carved wooden hippocampus out front, this inn offers broth and toast at all hours, private rooms with canopied beds (warmer than most accommodations in Dock Ward, especially in winter) and carpeted floors. It is favored by many regular visitors to the city who have business near the harbor. It recently became a dangerous tavern known as the

Hidden Blade for a short time, but has reverted to its former owner and favored reputation. ${ }^{59}$

Proprietor: Barl Shardrin, the proprietor, is a quiet, attentive, polite man.

Inn, Tavern \& Festhall  
![img-163.jpeg](assets/Volo's%20Guide%20To%20Waterdeep_img-163.jpeg)

This large, fairly new establishment is adorned with rich seablue draperies and takes the form of a series of elegant dining

[^0]
[^0]: ${ }^{59}$ Location \#278 on the color map. Its brief career as the Hidden Blade is mentioned in the Harpers novel Elfshadow, by Elaine Cunningham.

---

lounges, in which one dines or just drinks with an attractive host or hostess (or alone). One can take rooms for the night alone, or with someone else. Increasingly, the Arms (having acquired a safe reputation) is being used by single gentlefolk on the prowl for a night of love. In other words, patrons are going there to meet each other, not to hire a host or hostess for the night.

The Arms is large, well-lit, always busy, and can be quite expensive for the works (stabling, a room, meals, drinks, and companionship are all billed separately). Its nature makes it ideal for visitors intending to use it for some purposes. A merchant could take a room there, meet a business colleague there and eat dinner (perhaps with attractive house escorts), then go elsewhere for drinks and a play or show. The merchant could then stagger home late, knowing a comfortable room awaits.

This is an interesting trend. The only thing I regret about the Arms is that I'm far too apt to meet friends or business partners in its lounges when I want to slip up to my room unseen-or slip out unobserved. ${ }^{60}$

Proprietress: The Arms is run by Calathia Frost, a handsome and winning lady with a gorgeous, throaty voice. She keeps to herself and does her job.

### The Purple Palace

### 33333

This is the closest thing Waterdeep has to a Calishite silks-boudoir. Its lavender silk draperies and gauzy hangings are heavily perfumed. Everything is cushions, soft carpets, music, and purple-tinted, spiced wine.

Companionship is expensive and (reputedly) very good. Some of the most famous are Naneethil of the Sword Tattoo and Dessra of the Dark Desires. ${ }^{61}$

Proprietress: The proprietress, Tathla "Flamehair" Nightstar, was famous as a courtesan in Calimport 30 years ago, and is still a great beauty. Her blood-red hair surrounds her like a cloak, and is so long that it trails behind her on the ground!

### Alleys

Dock Ward boasts the most colorful and dangerous alleyways and courtyards in the City of Splendors. Tourists are advised to be very sure of their personal defenses before walking any of these by night, even if not alone.

carters' way services many warehouses and businesses along its short length. It can be a fascinating place to watch skilled loaders and unloaders, who can throw and catch heavy barrels and crates with speed and accuracy.

Except for those who look threatening and have weapons at the ready this is as safe as an alley gets. Private guards belonging to the businesses and to the Fellowship of Carters and Coachmen guild are everywhere, vigilant and armed with crossbows, clubs, and short swords.

### Black Wagon Alley

### 8888

Running east off Book Street to the north of Candle Lane, this narrow way leads to a warren of houses of the poor, including some thieves. City watch patrols are often busy cutting away tripwires and stranglewires from its more easterly stretches. It is named for the ghostly apparition of a black plague wagon that is sometimes seen slowly and silently moving up the alley, without horses or a driver!

### Black Well Court

### 88888

Opening west off Book Street, across from the end of Drakiir Street, this cramped courtyard is known for its long-polluted well (the water is black!) and as the  
meeting place of many gangs of street ruffians, thugs, and cultists over the years. As such, it is regularly patrolled by the city guard and the watch-but they of ten encounter thugs, Dragon Cultists, or worshippers of Loviatar "ministering" to some poor victim kidnapped from somewhere nearby.

There are also rumors of something living under the black water in the well that comes out at night to snatch and feed on passersby.

### Candle Lane

### 8888

Sometimes called Candle Alley, this winding way links Book Street and the Way of the Dragon. Its name comes from its extreme gloominess (it's overhung by tall houses), which made bookish sorts lit targets for thieves. It is now heavily patrolled. The Thirsty Throat tavern stands at its eastern end.

### Caedermon's Walk

### 88

Linking Shipmasters' Hall with Wharf Street, this route is named for the ghostly ship captain who often walks up it, wooden clogs echoing in the mist, leaving wet footprints in his wake.

Caerdermon was drowned in the harbor by his mate, and rose as a revenant to follow his killer

to Shipmasters' Hall. A fearful wizard there blasted him to dust before he could slay the mate and ever since, Caerdermon's phantom has walked this alley. There are whispers that the sea captains ghost can slay or harm those who block his path.

By day, this route is busy with carts serving the businesses all around. It is one of the alleys dominated by muscular men moving heavy barrels with oneman push-dollies.

### Fishnet Alley

$\checkmark$  
Linking Spice Street and Dock Street in a dogleg west of Wharf Street, this narrow crowded alley gets its name from the drying nets that are hung across it at various levels from wall hooks by night or for repair by day.

Down the years, these nets have broken the fall of many thieves and lovers leaping from windows, or have been dropped from above by thugs to entrap people passing along the alley. Although it looks like the webchoked lair of some giant spider, this alley is usually quite safe. However…

### Manysteps Alley

$\checkmark$ J  
Running parallel to and between Slut Street and the Way of the Dragon, this long, winding back  
way is home to many soothsayers, shady moneylenders, message runners, and fix-it-for-you thug bands. Avoid it if well-dressed or carrying obvious wealth. Thieves are never far off.

### Melinter's Court

$\checkmark$ J  
Behind (east of) the Hanged Man tavern, this dark courtyard is of ten full of pipe smoke, as philosophers spill out of the tavern, tankards in hand, to continue debates begun inside. Named for the evil mage who, a decade or so ago, formed a gang of thieves that met here to plan their villainy, this courtyard continues to be used from time to time by the evil mages who were once Melinter's apprentices.

Melinter is dead, but at times mages arrive at night, sleep any patrons in the courtyard, and meet to plan dark deeds. I couldn't find anyone willing to tell me very much about these wizards, but I did hear the names Azibar of the Seven Skulls, Felibarr Blacklance, and Onshall Goldcloak mentioned.

### Philosopher's Court

Better known to locals by its derisive name, the Foolsquare, this sunny court has always been where old men, drunkards, young thinkers, and the more

daring of the city's wealthy intellectuals have gathered when the weather is good to argue, flapping their jaws on a raised dais and weathered chairs. Drunks sleep under both the dais and the chairs by night.

Certain nameless nobles pay for torches and a standing city watch patrol to keep proceedings from being interrupted by thieves, ruffians, critics, or nightfall. Some whisper that Piergeiron or Khelben Arunsun or Mirt pay for the arrangements, but many nobles have been heard to say that "an afternoon stroll to hear the fools is better mirth than most shows thrice the price."

### Round Again Alley

Paralleling Wastrel Alley on the west, from north of Adder Lane to Belnimbra's Street, this narrow alley doubles back on itself (hence its name), and is the favored testing ground of someone who can create magical illusions of beholders.

Many Waterdhavians have seen silent, menacing eye tyrants gliding along the alley eyestalks writhing-only to fade away at the touch of hurled objects, or upon reaching the end of the way. What this means, and if it is dangerous, is not yet known.

### Thelten's Alley

### 200

Running northwest off Watchrun Alley, across from the end of Drawn Sword Alley this short way is named for the crazed wizard who dwelt here. Through some arcane magic, he survives as a wizshade, ${ }^{62}$ and can still be encountered here or in Thelten's Court, which opens off this alley to the north.

This sometimes-seen magical apparition may whimsically ignore or aid folk, but more often attacks. The Watchful Orders  
best efforts have not yet succeeded in destroying Thelten's strange remnants.

### Three Thrown Daggers Alley

### 200

Linking Blackstar Lane and Spiderweb Alley this winding way is famous for the curse cast here by the mage Arundoom. Struck in the back by three daggers hurled by a treacherous apprentice, he survived to take revenge. Once for each of his eight years of apprenticeship, the apprentice was driven by magi-

cal fear to flee up the alley and there face three animated daggers that swooped out of thin air at random points up and down the alley.

The spell survives, despite the efforts of later wizards to eradicate it. Because of this, anyone using the alley must beware three random attacks. ${ }^{63}$

Thugs sometimes lure or chase intended victims into the alley to get them injured. This route is sometimes called just Thrown Dagger Alley.

### Trollcrook Alley

### J

Linking Snail Street and Slut Street, this relatively open, safe passage is today much used by carters-rushing wagons are its chief danger. Of old, it was frequented at night by a vicious gang of trolls dwelling in the city's sewers. They slew many citizens before being hunted down. Some sages misname this alley Troll crush Alley.

### Twoflask Alley

### 2000

Running due west from the midpoint of Bitter Alley, this way turns south and then loops back  
north across itself to reach the broad way of Fish Street. The back way into the Thirsty Sailor, this still-dangerous passage is a haunt of thieves, thugs, and ladies of the evening who defend themselves or fell would-be customers with sleep-poisoned rings or long nailsheaths. Its name comes from an old joke about needing to drink two flasks of wine to have the courage to walk down it.

### Watchrun Alley

### 2000

This northeast/southwest route links Nelnuk's Walk with Redcloak Lane and Gut Alley and gets its name from its frequent use by the city watch and the city guard to hurry across this part of Dock Ward. Being in the path of a running (or mounted, and charging!) patrol is itself a danger-and carters at times race each other along this route.

Thieves and cruel pranksters have been known to stretch tripwires and stranglewires across this alley by night. It is common knowledge in the ward that major gangs in this area have hired eyes watching this route to keep track of the city guard and the city watch. ${ }^{64}$
