The engaging rogue Volo has done a better job on this tome, know ye, than on his misguided volume on magic (Volo's Guide to All Things Magical). It were best he should leave dabbling in Art to those who know better.

Naetheless, he missed a lot of Waterdeep that even an occasional visitor such as myself can spot. Much, no doubt, passed unseen beneath his very nose. He's got some things quite wrong, too-but ye'll discover what when ye meet them, even if that's (ahem) just a might late.

My colleague, Ed of the Greenwood, has prevailed upon me to include some small items of import to gamers. Reluctantly I have done so, adding probable details-trust not in their veracity I warn ye!-of various Waterdhavians at the back of this tome (including the impetuous Volo himself). All the rest, errors and all, I've left. I must warn ye. Khelben and his lady Laeral laughed to tears on several occasions while reading this work-and as I can find little amusing in it, I can only conclude they found hilarious errors!

May the gods smile upon ye, traveler, broader than they do upon Volo.

### Eliminales of Shadcadale

P.S. FR1 Waterdeep and the North remains the definitive guide to features of Waterdeep, augmented by the City System and Ruins of Undermountain boxed sets, the Knight of the Living Dead gamebook, and the module FRE3 Waterdeep. Those desiring to explore alleys Volo mentions would do well to consult where the alleys meet with the sewers, on page 28 of Waterdeep and the North, if they wish to avoid (or find, I suppose) danger.

One note more: For the safety of Waterdeep, I've refrained from passing on details of the abodes or persons of Durnan, Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun, Laeral, Mirt, Piergeiron, and certain others-and cut out much or all of what Volo had to say about them, too. If you'd know such folk, meet them yourselves and learn what they'll grant ye. Enjoy thy read…
