walled villa ${ }^{24}$ of the noble family for which it is named. Of old, Waterdeep's first temple to Selune was located on this site. Known as the High House of Stars, it was burned to the ground by raiding worshippers of Bane. Selune's faithful never set foot on the desecrated ground again, building their present temple a block to the west. Local rumor holds that the cellars of the burnt temple still hide magic and wealth, buried under burned rubble-and that they can be reached by stairs and shafts now hidden under the paving stones of this alleyway

### Pharra's Alley

![img-58.jpeg](assets/Volo's%20Guide%20To%20Waterdeep_img-58.jpeg)

This alleyway is named for the first magistress of the House of Wonder (the temple to Midnight, formerly to Mystra, which the alley passes), who died more than 120 years ago. It is a busy shortcut route used by merchants and their delivery carts, and is often crowded with would-be wizards coming to the House of Wonder to try and hire on as an apprentice to a wizard. Some are anxious to impress everyone with their magic or are just very, very nervous-and they have been

known to let fly wildly with magic, endangering passersby.

They vanish hurriedly though, when the Circle of Skulls appears. This spellhaunt, as wizards call it, is all that is left of some early priests of Mystra who tried to devise their own means of immortality-and achieved only a lich-like state.

These eerie skulls are always seen floating in a circle, arguing among themselves in hollow echoing voices. They spit spells from their empty mouths or hurl beams of fire from their empty eye sockets when angered by those they encounter, but are unpredictable and may help someone with information instead of attacking. They seem tied to Pharra's Alley and never appear anywhere else in the city, though the information they pass on indicates that they must be able to see and hear things in other parts of Waterdeep.

### Prayer Alley

### F

Running south off Aureenar Street at its eastern end, this alleyway hooks around inside a city block to parallel Phastal Street, to the south, for much of its length. It is named for those caught in it in more lawless days by thieves. Such unfortunates didn't have a prayer of escape due to the length of the alley and its lack of side exits.  
![img-59.jpeg](assets/Volo's%20Guide%20To%20Waterdeep_img-59.jpeg)

A disused warehouse encircled by it (located just east of its lone tree) is sometimes magically replaced by an infamous vanishing shop that deals in magic, spell components, weird artifacts, and objects from other worlds and planes. This place, rarely seen these days, is known as Whistlewink's Revenge, after the crazed old wizard who runs it.

### Roguerun Alley

### $\mathcal{F}$

This narrow alley runs up the interior of the westernmost city block on the north side of the Street of Glances. A famous inn, the House of the Flying Horse,

once backed onto this alley. The inn was used by smugglers as a clearinghouse for fencing stolen goods and was ultimately destroyed in a spell duel between rival wizards. A treasure of unclaimed smugglers' loot is still said to lie hidden somewhere around or under this alley which got its name from the number of times smugglers ran full tilt down it to escape city guardsmen raiding the inn.

### Rook Alley

This alley just north of Skulls Street, curls around the inside of  
the city block entered by Kulzar's Alley.

It is named for a notable thief, the Rook, who flourished about 50 years ago and had his secret headquarters here. He died fighting in it when discovered by officers of the city guard. The Rook's hold was a series of old crypts - the old burial grounds that give Skulls Street its name that he tunneled down to from this alley. The tunnel, blocked off with stones, is said to still exist, along with his treasure. It is guarded by undead from the crypt who attacked the last folk brave enough to unseal the tunnel.

### Runer's Alley

This short, three-branched passage winds through the triangular city block that stands between Julthoon Street, Haltover Street, and the Sutherlane. It is named for the Runer, a minstrel who slept here for years.

A wizard once mistakenly thought Runer's pipes were enchanted and his song a magical attack, so he used a dispel magic on the minstrel. It stripped away Runer's magical disguise, revealing him to be a missing noblewoman, Shrylla Manthar.

This eccentric free spirit had  
fled when her parents told her whom to marry and escaped discovery for almost 30 years. Unmasked, she refused to return to her house and station and lived on in this alley becoming known as Shrylla of the Spiders. Her long, fantastically coifed hair hid not only needle daggers and lockpicks, but a poisonous spider trained to defend her.

Feeling death coming, she climbed Mount Waterdeep to see one last dawn and died there. Her body was not discovered for months among the rocks-and the spider lived on in her skull, using one empty, staring eye socket as its door.

Sabbar's Alley

This tiny, dogleg alleyway opens eastwards off the Street of the Singing Dolphin ${ }_{6}$ just south of Aureenar Street. ${ }^{25}$ It is named for Sabbar, an unscrupulous wizard who dwelt at its innermost end until he disappeared, some 80 winters ago.

Sabbar was known to hurl fireballs at boys who ventured into this alley to play, and was infamous for once maliciously transforming buckets of raw, live fishbait worms into the sem-  
blance of well-cooked, spiced beef roasts, just before guests were served at a feast.

Nowadays, this alley is the gathering place for a local street gang, who can sometimes be hired to watch or follow a person by anyone bold enough to contact and pay them.

### Satchel Alley

This shortcut runs northwest from Diamond Street. It was named for the bags of gems and valuables that jewelers used to

carry along it before waiting thieves made the trip too dangerous (in the days when Waterdeep had a Thieves Guild). It's now a place where the coaches, carts, and mounts of the travelers staying at the inns all around it load and unload their passengers and cargo, and as a result is wellpaved with dung.

### Seawind Alley

Running south from the Street of Lances, this alleyway offers rear access to the buildings in its city block. Usually shrouded in sea  
mist, it once led to a now-vanished inn, the Banshee at Bay (other, unrelated inns also bear this name in Cormyr and in Amn). The inn was destroyed, over a hundred winters ago, after everyone inside it was found dead of some unknown disease. Their restless spirits are still said to haunt the alley though few have seen anything eerie in recent years.

![img-64.jpeg](assets/Volo's%20Guide%20To%20Waterdeep_img-64.jpeg)

Aureenar Street and east of Stormstar's Ride. It is named for an antiquated sort of knife known as a shank, wielded by thieves who used to gather in this alley.

Today, it is a crowded place stacked with fish crates where many city birds gather to feed. Local youths and visitors skilled with a sling or hurled sticks and stones kill the birds to sell to cooks throughout the city or for their own meals.

### Sharra's Flight

This wide courtyard opens east  
off the Street of Whispers and connects with Moonstar Alley. It is named for Sharra of the Invisible Dragon, the famous archmage who roused Neverwinter in a long-ago coastal war by using a spell to bring her cry into every bedroom of the city: "Awake, and to arms! Awake, or the princes of Sundul will come for us in our beds!" Due to her efforts the forces of Neverwinter rose up, defended their city against the naval attack, and followed their foes home to destroy the Calishite realm of Sundul.

Sharra created this route when still an apprentice to

escape being caught in a magical battle between rival mages of power. She blasted down a building and ran through the space she'd just cleared. The open space has remained that way ever since. It is today used by several street vendors, who cram their stalls into it, selling candies, sweets, exotic liqueurs, eel pie and rare delicacies of the deep, and cut-rate jewelry to passersby.

### The Skulkway

This short passage cuts across the southern corner where the Street of Glances meets Westwall

Street. It was literally used to skulk past the noses of the city guard when they established a stationary watch at the crossroads against smugglers. At the time, the Skulkway was occupied by a building-or so all but the smugglers thought. It was actually an empty shell, with holes in each wall large enough for a cart to be driven through. The holes were covered by illusions created by an enterprising wizard, and during the day doors were rolled across the openings under the cloaking illusion to avoid unintentional discovery of the magic.

This lasted until one day the building vanished-illusions,

stonework, roof and all. Some claim the smugglers fought amongst themselves, and destroyed the place. Others think the Lords - or a powerful wizard acting for them-made the building vanish. The cause of the disappearance was a hot topic for arguments among local citizens. None knew the truth. ${ }^{27}$

### Sniff Alley

### D

From the north end of Gorl Street, this alley curves east and then north to meet the Street of

Glances. Named for the smell of the fishbone pile that was located here until the Lords tightened laws about garbage, this is today a pleasant, paved back way with a tree, benches for relaxing under its shade, and a small handpump of cool water for public use. It's a good spot for the visitor to rest in for awhile-but it also seems to be a favorite meeting place for whispered conversations amongst shady characters. Try very hard to look uninterested and hum or yawn to indicate that you're not listening if you're getting the eye.

### Wagonslide Alley

This alley links Westwall Street with Seawatch Street through the block bounded by Diamond Street on the south and Grimwald's Way on the north. Its name comes from the steep, slippery slope leading up it from the west that has made many a wagon slip down it in wet or icy weather. In winter, sea rime is almost unbelievably fast to freeze here.

To improve traction, the stones of this street are laid loose, so they sit unevenly. Tripping is easy if you go too fast or don't look down. Under many of the  
stones are small hollows or pits, some undoubtedly dug by children playing in the street. Locals told me that not only are messages often left under certain stones, but some of them conceal magical weapons left ready by thieves who operate in the city from time to time. These are invisible weapons cached in plain sight under the stones-but, since they are invisible, no one can see them. Horridly clever, eh?

It is certain that whenever I went up or down this alley, I could feel the heavy gaze of eyes from windows above, where old men sit seemingly all day with nothing to do.
