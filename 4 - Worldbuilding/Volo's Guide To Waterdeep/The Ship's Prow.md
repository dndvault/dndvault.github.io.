# The Ship's Prow

Inn

### 111 111111

As its name suggests, this inn juts into the broad, usually crammed, meeting of Fish Street and Ship Street like the front of a rather fat ship. ${ }^{37}$ It's well-known among sailors up and down the Sword Coast. More than that, it's well thought of, and if my stay is to be trusted, justly so. Its best suited to folk who can stand the fishy stink of deep-sea traps and brine barrels-and the noises of dock work, drunken revelry and fighting, the night throughwafting into their rooms.

### The Place

The Ship's Prow rises four floors above the street. Years of wind and weather have turned the old boards of its upper floors and outside balconies silvery. In the moonlight on a clear night, it gleams from afar down the dark dockside streets. Inside, the floors are so warped that they rise and fall in smooth curves, like the deck of a ship in the swells. The place is shabby, but feels comfortable and homelike.

### The Prospect

This inn is surprisingly quiet inside, and a cozy place to sleep  
as such things are judged in Dock Ward. It provides an ideal haven for tired travelers newly arrived in the city and not flush enough to find beds in a better area. Its also a trysting place for masked young nobles of Waterdeep out on a lark, not wanting to be seen by their peers (I marked at least 11 such couples on my stay), and a refuge for drunken sailors looking for a bed to snore in, rather than things to smash or bodies to cuddle or punch.

### The Provender

There's nothing stronger than water to be had, nor can you get anything more to eat than smoked firefin, strong cheese, and hardloaf bread, bolstered in winter only with a bowl of hot fish-head soup (for 1 sp a person, in addition to room rates). The water is brought by the barrel from wells near Amphail and laced with crushed mint. It stands in jugs in every room, and can also be had for the asking as clear, hot tea.

### The People

The inn's peace and survival in the face of the ever-present danger of fire is due to the interwoven protective spells of the resident wizard and parttime cook, Shryndalla "Were-Eye" Ghaulduth. She's an ugly but cheerful old soul who pads

around in worn slippers and food-stained robes, accompanied by an entourage of cats. ${ }^{38}$

The master of the house is a one-eyed, scarred and silverbearded retired sailor, Jhambrote Harkhardest. He's genial and softspoken, but ever alert-and never lacks a short sword and an axe at his belt. The axe is magical. I saw an eye open on its blade and swivel around to take in all present. It winked shut in an instant when it saw me watching, but I saw what I saw.

Jhambrote doesn't go out much, and has standing arrange-  
ments with the guilds for supplies. He turns away rowdy would-be guests and those dealing in shady goods with cold looks and grim words, and seems to have no truck with smug-glers-nor with the city watch.

### The Prices

Rooms can be had for 4 sp to 1 gp per night (larger rooms and higher floors are dearer), or 3 gp to 7 gp per ten day. Most are 6 sp per night or 5 gp per tenday.

Linen is changed daily and the fee buys a single bath per night, if one desires, stabling for a single

animal, and unlimited drinking water. I, myself, would advise not availing oneself of a bath in harbor water, which smells of fish or worse. The stabling is around the back and is crowded and unheated, but feed is provided for stabled mounts.

### Travelers' Lore

I'm given to understand ${ }^{39}$ this inn is notorious among longtime inhabitants because it once housed evil beings of the infamous Cult of the Dragon. The Lords of the City are said to have given the present proprietor title to the place to keep an eye on it after the spectacular passing of his predecessor.

About 20 winters back, the inn was kept by one Halagaster Brutheen, who acquired it in mysterious circumstances from Ulcap Rhiddyn, who just disappeared one day. When the Brandished Blade, a company of adventurers, came to stay (by chance, most say), the fury of the gods reigned in the Ship's Prowfor on sight they knew Halagaster as a magically disguised red dragon on the run from them. This Halagaster-wyrm had devoured the unfortunate

Rhiddyn and taken his place, aided and paid court to here by the fell folk of the Dragon Cult.

There was great battle that night, and if the Watchful Order had not been alert and plentiful, much of the ward might well have burned. In the end, the wyrm was slain, and the Dragon Cult routed through the streets. No trace was found of the wyrm's hoard. Cultists have skulked about the inn and kept a watchful eye over it ever sinceseeking the dragons hoard or something else of value they've not yet found.

Some say the dragon hollowed out a large cellar beneath the place, devouring unfortunates whose adjoining cellars he broke into. No trace of such a warren has been found, and a docker I talked with told me that in that area a large cellar would soon flood or buildings above would collapse down into it.

When I asked host Harkhardest about this disguised dragon, he rolled a slow and cold eye around to stare levelly into my gaze, and suggested I talk to the city watch, if I was so very interested in such dangerous matters. ${ }^{40}$

[^0]: ${ }^{39}$ My source is Shabra the Beggar Queen, an old, stout, rather unwashed woman who styles herself an expert on Dock Ward. She can often be found at the Spitting Cat tavern, nursing a cup of broth-andbrandy as the hours pass. She can be induced to talk of doings and news of the area for the price of a good meal.  
    ${ }^{40}$ When I tackled Shryndalla alone on the same subject, she laughed, said she'd heard about me from some of her arcane colleagues, winked, and would say no more. I suspect she was referring to the unfortunate reception that Volo's Guide to All Things Magical received, but I wrapped myself in dignity as if it were a fine cloak and turned our talk to lighter matters. Several times since, though, I have seen Shryndalla's cats watching me, as I walk the streets of the city.

### The Blushing Mermaid

Tavern, Inn, \& Festhall

### 䍐䍐䍐 DDD D

The Mermaid is one of the most luxurious establishments in Dock Ward. Everything is unhurried, luxurious, and sensual, with no detail overlooked. The staff wear facemasks of black armor plate with attached black gauze veils to conceal their faces.

### The Place

Fronting on Net Street within easy reach of the harbor stenches, ${ }^{41}$ the Blushing Mermaid spans three buildings. Scents stream from amber hanging lamps. Gauzy curtains, cushions, and sound-eating carpets are everywhere. Special, extremely expensive enchantments prevent any sort of open flame from igniting them. Even fire magic is foiled. Every guest has a plush, decadent private bedroom, a private bathroom, and an office/reception room in which to entertain.

It is widely known that the Mermaid is honeycombed with secret passages, reached by sliding wall panels in every room-but few guests manage to get those panels to work.

### The Prospect

The original light pleasure palace of Waterdeep, combining a place to stay with places to drink and have fun, the Mermaid has always catered to the wealthy by maintaining an atmosphere of quiet decadence. The Mermaid bends most of its attention to creating a cozy atmosphere for festhall activities-and so its food and tavern facilities suffer. True to its name, the Mermaid does offer one special drinking and dining experience: a heated, scented communal bath in which patrons soak as they eat and drink, served by mermaids, who swim in from the harbor via well-guarded secret tunnels. ${ }^{42}$ Messy foods can simply be washed away in the lavendertinted waters.

### The Provender

Seafood-and, surprisingly, whole roast pig-are the specialties of the Mermaid's kitchens. Everything is good, if a little underseasoned, but runs expensive: 1 gp to $3 \mathrm{gp} /$ person per meal. Drinks are extra, with a full wine cellar ( 1 gp to $22 \mathrm{gp} /$ bottle, depending on your choice), plentiful zzar (the almond-flavored sherry favored by many in Waterdeep) at $1 \mathrm{sp} /$ glass, and very ordinary beer at 2 $\mathrm{cp} /$ tankard.

    ${ }^{42}$ These tunnels were no doubt used for smuggling in bygone days, but they are now blocked by locked gratings with alarms, and are used by mermen and mermaids to report for shifts at the Mermaid and to dine: a special section of the Blushing Mermaid's kitchens cater to the merfolk.
