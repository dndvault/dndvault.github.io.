# The Moon Sphere

This strange, beautiful feature of South Ward appears only on nights when the moon is full. The Moon Sphere is a magical globe of blue radiance that appears in Dancing Court as the result of an ancient, powerful enchantment. ${ }^{19}$

The courtyard was left clear because of it, and the adjacent Jade Dancer was built to take advantage of it. For generations folk have come to Waterdeep to see it, and Waterdhavians have used it to relax and in courting each other.

### The Place

Dancing Court is a smoothfinished courtyard paved in flagstones. Its central space is perhaps 60 feet across. In the midst of this a 40 -foot-diameter sphere of translucent, vivid blue radiance fades into being as the rays of the full moon fall on the Court and fades away with waning moonlight.

By Waterdhavian law no one is allowed to restrict access of anyone else to the sphere or charge any fee for admittance to its confines. And no one is allowed to cast any spell or unleash  
any magic within, or into, the Dancing Court for fear of disrupting the magic. By tradition, a city guard patrol, accompanied by a member of the Watchful Order (always a wizard of some power) keeps watch over the Dancing Court when the Sphere is present.

### The Prospect

The Moon Sphere has existed for at least a century due to a powerful magic created by the goddess Selune. There have always been rumors that she, various avatars of her, or her agents reside in Waterdeep, concealing themselves among the common folk.

The ideal place of worship to Selune is open to the sky - on a bare hilltop or clearing in a forest. In a city, a rooftop or open space is preferable to an enclosed chancel. Because of this, many services at the House of the Moon take place on its roof, visible to all nearby. The Moon Sphere is said to be the sailors' temple, open to all. Whenever it appears, any sailors in the city sober enough to make the journey travel to it to extend a hand into the blue glow and whisper a prayer to the Lady to see them safe to their next port. The danger rating for the Sphere is for who you might meet with, around, or near it, not for the Sphere itself.

What makes the Sphere attractive to those who do not worship Selune is its major magical property: ${ }^{20}$ Living beings who enter it and will themselves to rise can fly about inside the sphere's radiant confines. ${ }^{21}$ Traditionally, courting couples  
come here to dance in the air and kiss on high, floating so only their lips touch. There are tales of even more ardent activities between intimate companions within the Sphere's radius.

Guests in the Jade Dancer customarily extend their festivities into the Court on nights of the full moon and drift or fly while drinking. The more daring even leap from the balcony of the Jade Dancer into the Moon Sphere. It is a mark of social daring and debonair nonchalance to do this without spilling even a drop of one's drink.

### Travelers' Lore

There are many tales of dancers finding their true love in the sphere-even Piergeiron, High Lord of Waterdeep, is said to have first met his bride, Maethiira

[^0]
[^0]: ${ }^{20}$ Volo: There are other powers. Even high-ranking priestesses of Selune don't know them all. Devout worshippers of Selune can be healed of wounds, poisoning, insanity, diseases, and magical curses by contact with the Sphere, but just how, when, and what rituals are involved remain unknown to me. The city guard patrols strongly discourage any experimentation intended to learn the secrets of the Sphere.

    Elminster: Let's keep things that way.  
    ${ }^{21}$ Elminster's assistance has given us these details:  
    Any sentient being can fly at will, with Maneuverability Class A and a movement rate of 7. Up to the flying being's own weight in worn or carried material can be supported. One person cannot drag another down by grasping them and willing descent. The Sphere's magic parts the two, so only one falls.

    Descent within the Sphere is governed by conditions equal to a feather fall spell.  
    Beings who pass entirely out of the Sphere by means of their own navigation or who are forced out (and objects fired, hurled, or dropped out) fall to the ground below with normal speed and damaging effects. If they fall back into contact with the Sphere, its magic reasserts itself over their fall. The Sphere extends 30 feet above the Court at its highest point.

    The Moon Sphere also affects magic cast within it. Spells of the abjuration, enchantment/charm, and greater divination schools when cast by a wizard of chaotic good alignment only and, when cast by a priest of Selune only, the spheres all, charm, creation, divination, guardian, healing, necromantic, protection and wards will have the fullest possible effects (maximum duration, etc.) when cast or triggered in the Sphere. The Sphere does the same thing to magic connected with starlight and moonglow (the powers of a ring of shooting stars, for example). Fire-based spells, however, are always reduced to the minimum possible damage ( 1 point per die) and effects.

    Certain magics are twisted by the Sphere into wild magic results-hence the prohibition against magic. Adventurers are warned to curb any reckless behavior or tendencies while in Dancing Court or the Moon Sphere.

here. ${ }^{22}$ Selune herself is said to sometimes appear conferring powers, punishments, and geaslike directives upon folk. Her priestesses try to send at least one of their number to dance and pray in the Moon Sphere each time it appears.

There is also a ghostly tale about the phantoms of seven murdered princesses sometimes seen dancing in the Sphere. These young ladies, all of the royal house of Tethyr, were slain in Waterdeep some 80 winters back by a cruel host: their uncle, who wanted the throne.

After a night of joyful dancing with handsome young men in the Moon Sphere, which they found wondrous, the princesses were very tired. Their uncle replaced the pillows in their beds with mimic grubs (flatworm-like relatives of mimics who dissolve flesh by touch). The unfortunate girls were found dead in the morn, intact except for their heads, which had been eaten away to clean, bare skulls.

Many bravos and young blades of Waterdeep have spoken, down the many nights since, of dancing with pretty maidens in rich gowns. They are silent, but seem somehow sad, their eyes bright

[^0]with unshed tears-and their faces, when approached closely (for a kiss, perhaps), are instantly transformed into grinning skulls!

Certain powerful wizards of Waterdeep are also said to come here on rare occasions, when deep in thought, and drift about, staring at the stars as they ponder. It's the closest some folk of Waterdeep ever get to the great Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun, and, for that matter, his more sinister rival, Maaril, and the aged head of the noble house of Wands, Maskar.

There is also a rumor among wizards that the touch of the Moon Sphere can recharge certain items, if the right words are spoken. ${ }^{23}$

[^0]: ${ }^{22}$ Maethiira has been dead for almost 14 years. Piergeiron has not remarried and dotes on their daughter, Aleena, who is tall, grave, beautiful, reclusive, and said to dabble in magic.  
    ${ }^{23}$ This rumor is true. Elminster refused to reveal the ritual, but did say that wands of magic missiles are among the items aided by the Sphere.
