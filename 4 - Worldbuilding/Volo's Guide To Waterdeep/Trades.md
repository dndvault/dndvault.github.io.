# Trades

f all the wards in Waterdeep, this ward has the least community feel. You certainly can't tell by walking through the streets where it ends and South Ward or Dock Ward begins.

Trades Ward is almost entirely given over to commerce. Middleclass workers and merchants dwell and ply their trades there. The ward wraps around most of the City of the Dead, running out from its walls along Andamaar's Street to the High Road, down that broad street to Snail Street, and down Snail Street to Shesstra's Street, where it turns east. The boundary jogs south at Book Street to Drakiir Street, runs east along it to the Way of the Dragon, keeps to the north side of Telshambra's Street as it runs on east to the High Road, and there jogs north again to turn east at Sahtyra's Lane. It takes in Caravan Court and then follows Belzor's Walk northeast to the city wall. The city wall, and those of the City of the Dead, make up the rest of its boundaries.

Inside this area are many  
landmarks the visitor won't want to miss. Besides, it's almost impossible to travel anywhere in Waterdeep without passing through Trades Ward. Its streets are always busy. On dark nights, so many lighters are at work here that it looks like a sea of bobbing stars from afar.

Watch patrols are very frequent. ${ }^{1}$ The protection of property is paramount in this ward-theft and vandalism are the worst evils. Crowding, pushing, shoving, and cursing are commonplace at the day's height.

### Landmarks

The congested streets make walking while looking up in this ward-or even stopping for a good look-hazardous at most times of day. This is quite a pity, because there's a lot to see.

The first thing that strikes one's eye is the tallest building: the Plinth, a temple at which all faiths can pray. No person can be barred entry from it. In fact, in winter its warmth keeps a lot of poorer citizens alive.

This mighty tower stands like a

[^0]: ${ }^{1}$ City watch patrols are detailed on page 17 of FR1 Waterdeep and the North. In this ward, four-sword patrols pass a given point about every 10 minutes and look into a tavern or inn dining room every 30 minutes. As detailed on pages 18,19 and 23 of the City System book, six-man city guard detachments also patrol the ward. Typical patrol details are given therein on page 23. Reinforcements will be a dozen LG hm F3s to F6s in chain mail and armed with maces, long swords, slings, daggers, and a polearm. Guard patrols pass a given street location every 45 minutes or so, and appear 1 d 10 minutes after a city watch patrol blows a warning horn in this ward.

needle-like, tall and thin pyramid with the top cut off. The flat roof is a landing place for aerial steeds used by the wealthy and powerful. At many levels on the Plinth's sides are balconies. City laws forbid sacrifices of intelligent beings to any god, but a lot of folk leap or are helped to fall from these heights each year.

The next most prominent features of the ward are three open spaces-the Court of the White Bull, where livestock is bought and sold; Caravan Court, which is usually a dust-shrouded melee of cursing whip-wielding drovers, bawling beasts of burden, and creaking wagons and carts; and Virgin's Square, where warriors gather to await hire.

There are plenty of inns and taverns in this ward, but aside from the Plinth, no temples. There are also countless shops, most rising three floors above the street, with apartments above the stores-but only one mage's tower. ${ }^{2}$ I'm sure many wizards of middling powers dwell here, but there's only one of power and wealth enough to erect a traditional wizard's tower who has elected to stay in Trades Ward.

The main feature of this ward are the many guildhalls-a wearying list of places that vie

for the attention of passersby with large replicas of whatever goods the guild produces, gilded lettering, and grand facades. These are working headquarters, and many folk travel a long way to get inside them, to deal with the guilds. The guildhalls are: the Citadel of the Arrow headquarters of the Fellowship of Bowyers \& Fletchers; ${ }^{3}$ Costumers' Hall, of the Order of Master Taylors, Glovers, \& Mercers; ${ }^{4}$ the House of Song, of the Council of Musicians, Instrument-Makers, and Choristers; ${ }^{5}$ the Office of the League of Basketmakers \& Wickerworkers; ${ }^{6}$ and the House of Cleanliness, of the Launderers' Guild. ${ }^{7}$

This ward is also home to the Old Guildhall, headquarters to the Cellarers and Plumbers Guild; ${ }^{8}$ the Zoarstar, headquarters of the Scriveners, Scribes, and Clerks Guild; ${ }^{9}$ the House of Textiles, of the Most Excellent Order of Weavers and Dyers; ${ }^{10}$ the Guild Paddock, of the Stablemasters' and Farriers' Guild; ${ }^{11}$ Cobblers' \& Corvisers' House, ${ }^{12}$ the house of light, of the Guild  
of Chandlers \& Lamplighters; ${ }^{13}$ Stationers' Ha11; ${ }^{14}$ and Wheel Hall, of the Wheelwrights' Guild. ${ }^{15}$

The Zoarstar, in particular, is always crowded. Aside from all those who need letters written, gawkers are always peering through the windows at the maps, charts, and architectural renderings on display on easels at its front. One such map is always an overall view of the city as a kindness to visitors. Go there if you get lost. The Zoarstar is on the northwest corner of Quill Alley and Wide Way northwest of the Court of the White Bull.

Shoppers should explore at night in a leisurely manner with a lighter and a group of armed friends, then traverse the ward in an organized shopping route by day. It's often said you can buy anything in Waterdeep. A walk around Trades Ward will have you believing that. (I'll admit I let the "guaranteed" unicat familiar go even before its illusory unicorn horn started to fade. It stopped clawing me and hurried back to its shop to be sold again.)
