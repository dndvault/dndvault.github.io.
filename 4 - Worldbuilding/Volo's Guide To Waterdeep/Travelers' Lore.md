# Travelers' Lore

It is widely rumored that a large amount of treasure-a dragon hoard, brought back to Waterdeep by an adventuring company sponsored by the guild long ago-is hidden somewhere in or under the House. Would-be prospectors are warned that the staff take a very dim view of people who dig or pry at walls, floors, and ceilings.

The adventuring band, the Guild Adventuring Company (colloquially known as the Flying Flagons) all perished at Yartar, defending it against raiding orcs. This is remembered in the "Fall of the Company" written by the Company's bard, Felestin, and  
sent by spell to a comrade a day's hard ride distant as the adventurers fought their last fight.

These days, most guild members can recall only a snatch of the song. But visitors beware: If you laugh or offer disrespect when this stanza is sung, all the men singing with tears in their eyes are apt to rise up and separate you from your life.

And no one will stand there to hear our reply,  
And no one will come there to see heroes dieâ€¦  
Oh, raise flagons high  
And swords to the sky  
For guild and adventure  
Die well when you die!
