# Feldyn's Recipes

Elminster warns that dragon meat should be properly prepared before eating (see page 82 of FOR1 Draconomicon) and that cockatrices should not be touched for at least three hours after death-and even then, gloves should be used to pluck out the larger feathers and throw them away. The large feathers sometimes retain the power to petrify for days.

He also tells me one pour is a measure achieved by tipping a shaken bottle upside down and then immediately upright again. A knife is an amount that stays on the blade of a knife. Merithian sauce is equivalent to a strongly spiced steak sauce. Nightcap mushrooms are found only in the Realms. Be very cautious with mushroom substitutions.

These recipes also show some time measures used by cooks in the Realms. The 16 verses of song called for (at least, as Elminster sang them) equal about 8 rounds, game time, and the space of a good sword-sharpening seems to be about 6 turns.

Leek cooks, push it around just enough to prevent burning.

Cut off the bowy head and neck of the cockatrice, which can later be boiled for soup. Slit the carcass up the breast, turning out the gizzard (with its some-times-poisonous contents) and other organs.

The cockatrice need not be skinned. Its leathery, scaly outer skin protects the tender flesh during cooking. Don't let blood and fluids drain away or the bird will cook too dry. Tough or dried carcasses should be doused in diluted wine ( 1 part to 2 parts water) before roasting.

Stuff the carcass with celery and thyme. Put in the skillet atop sizzling leeks, roast for 16 verses of "The Unicorn and the Maiden," and turn.

When both sides are brown, turn the carcass so it lies with the flattest side down, and douse it with the wine. When bubbling and sizzling dies, baste the carcass with the brown sauce. Roast for the space of a good sword-sharpening, basting often and turning when needed to keep the color even.

The skin will crack and dry like old parchment, lifting and flaking away like wood ash when the meal is done. Take from the fire and let cool until it can be held for eating. Goes well with ale and greens.

### The House of Good Spirits

Tavern, Inn, Winery E Headquarters of the Vintners', Distillers', and Brewers' Guild

### 1900000

Located on the northwest side of the Rising Ride (at the crest of the small knoll for which that street is named) between the mouths of Juth Alley and Robin's Way, this complex of buildings is fronted by a timber, wattle and daub tavern. It extends north and west along Tornsar Alley as far as Buckle Street, where an alleyway offers access to the inn and its stables at the back of the tavern. ${ }^{32}$

The House of Good Spirits has always been a guild headquarters and a winery where sluth ${ }^{33}$ and zzar are made. (Zzar is made from sluth by fortifying it with almond liqueur.)

Some 60 winters ago, a small brewery was added on the corner of the Rising Ride and Tornsar Alley and then the tavern was opened. About four winters ago, the operators of the House expanded into an adjacent warehouse to open its doors as a 40 -bed inn primarily for the convenience of visiting grapegrowers and wine merchants.

Owned by the guild, this  
complex has enriched all guild members and now serves them as a home away from home base in which they can stay when their homes are overcrowded or being worked on, go for a quiet tankard when the working day is done, and house, entertain, and meet with business guests.

### The Place

The entire complex still looks like a collection of warehouses and factories inside and out. Massive, exposed beams and bare mud brick walls are everywhere, and the lamp lighting is dim. Small passages, cozy nooks, odd doorways, and surprise steps up and down are numerous, and furnishings are bare-bones and workaday, but comfortable and ruggedly serviceable.

The inn, tavern, wine store, winery, and brewery are directly joined inside, but a narrow courtyard separates the stables from the rest. ${ }^{34}$

### The Prospect

The House of Good Spirits boasts the best and cheapest selection of liqueurs and strong drink in the entire City of Splendors - even if, as a noble I overheard snootily put it, "You have to sit in the stinking brewery to drink its wares." Fiery blackthroat from

far Lantan is as plentiful in its spacious cellars as is ruby-red elverquisst, beloved of the elves.

It is a comfortable, if disorganized, inn, most of the rooms sporting two single beds and bare board floors. There are no luxuries, but tired travelers will find it a comfortable place to sleep. The low prices attract a regular clientele of hard drinkers, but the staff ${ }^{35}$ keep order. Brawls are frequent, but take place on the street outside, not within. Breaking one of the long, leaded windows of the tavernor forcing another patron to do so by hurling him through itcosts a brawler 4 gp . During daylight hours, guild representatives are always on hand for those who want to deal in spirits. Private meeting rooms are available for conferences.

### The Provender

The inn provides only a basic menu: roast boar, rabbit-andsmalls stew (fowl, vegetables, squirrels, and the like, always simmering in the kitchen), and cheese-and-mustard saltbread melts (small, circular loaves of very tasty bread).

### The People

The guild staff numbers 40 or so, from Elguth the stableboy (an  
expert guide to the gambling houses and festhalls of Waterdeep) to Simon Thrithyn the innkeeper. The resident chief guild buyer and seller is Dlarna Suone. Her second is Gordrym Zhavall. Dlarna is the only sharptempered and sharp-witted person in the place. The others tend to be stolid, calm folk-even the seven burly bouncers, who are led by Mrorn "Black Bracers" Halduth.

### The Prices

A room costs $2 \mathrm{gp} /$ bed per night. If one person wants a private room, he must pay for two beds, but can invite a nonstaying guest to eat the second food share. This rate includes stabling for all mounts and all meals desired just ask. Draft beasts are each 1 cp per night extra. The dining fare is restricted to the spare menu I listed. Also included is all the ale the guest wants to drink.

Wine and spirits are extra, and are sold by the bottle. Prices range from $2 \mathrm{cp} /$ bottle for sluth made on the premises (a cut rate-outside the tavern, such a bottle sells for 8 cp ) to $6 \mathrm{sp} /$ bottle of house zzar. Prices then rise rapidly to a high of $33 \mathrm{gp} /$ bottle for the finest, and with local unrest, very rare, Tethyrian distilled dragonsblood.
