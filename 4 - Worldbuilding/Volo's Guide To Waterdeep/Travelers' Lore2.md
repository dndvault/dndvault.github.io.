# Travelers' Lore

It seems that Jannaxil's shop has always been there, but old Waterdhavians tell me its been open some 60 years or so. During that time, Jannaxil has carried on running feuds with several scholars of the city-feuds carried on in the form of insulting gestures, gifts, and letters, or in ditties that tavern singers have been hired to perform in their taverns, for the amusement of all.

Jannaxil's cowardice has led him to pile up so many magical defenses that most folk think him to be a powerful wizard. There are many tales of thieves being blasted off his roof, or torn apart in the street outside his shop by huge black talons that appeared from thin air after they disturbed one of the boards covering his wares window. ${ }^{29}$

Jannaxil is said to have a special hatred of elves. He was recently wounded by Elaith "the Serpent" Craulnobur-who  
![img-147.jpeg](assets/Volo's%20Guide%20To%20Waterdeep_img-147.jpeg)  
pinned one of his hands to his desk with a thrown dagger. ${ }^{30}$

Jannaxil loves good books. He hungers to look inside just about any book he sees or hears of, especially illuminated tomes, old maps, and well-illustrated volumes depicting female beauty. He is known to pay extremely well for such things.

[^0]: ${ }^{29}$ Elminster tells us the self-renewing guardian glyphs on the shop are 99 in number. A dispel magic will negate any one glyph (only) for 1 turn per level of its caster. Glyphs can fire once per day and are ready again 24 hours ( 144 turns) later.

    Thirty-three of the glyphs are spell turning magics (enough will activate in combination to reflect back any spell $100 \%$ at the source).

    Thirty-three more are Caligarde's claw magics (a spell detailed in the FORGOTTEN REALMSÂ® Ad ventures hardcover). Some 2d4 of them will animate to attack any one being who tries to remove a board, pick the lock of Jannaxil's door, remove or harm the door, or chisel (or work magic on, including the writing of runes) any part of Jannaxil's shop walls.

    The last 33 glyphs are magic missile spells. Any being flying up to the roof of Jannaxil's shop or forcing a magical or physical way through walls, floors, or roof will be struck by 2 d 12 of these missiles, and a magical alarm will awaken Jannaxil to full alertness of their activation, wherever he may be in Faerun.

Three Pearls Nightclub

### 11111

Pearls, as it is called, is a popular evening destination for Waterdhavians, offering stand-up comics, trained animal acts, illusionists' recitals, bards, orators, and exotic dancing. ${ }^{31}$ Its name comes from its purchase price. When the owner of the tavern that stood here (the Black Buckler) decided sourly he'd lost his last gold piece pouring ale down parched throats and offered to sell the place to anyone who'd give him the price of a meal, one of his own dancers stopped up on the stage, tore off three black pearls-nearly all she was wearing-and threw them to him, claiming the place as her own. The dancer, Halidara Urinshoon, is seldom on stage these days. She's too busy eating chocolates and drinking amberjack sherry in North Ward while her riches pile up.

Almost every evening, crowds stream up Pearl Alley to the Three Pearls, except on nights when a guild or other large group rents it for a meeting or for private entertainment. Typically it rents out at prices ranging from 50 gp for the space to 100 gp for the space and shows thrown in, cash up front.

### The Place

The Three Pearls is now one huge room (plus jakes, opening off a cloak hall down one side). It has a low ceiling and is usually hot and smoky. Stout low-backed wooden benches radiate outwards from the raised central stage, which is lit from above and has a ramp entrance up into its center via trapdoor from below. The central stage has a conical raised ceiling above it, complete with a retractable circular staircase and drop ropes for dramatic entrances.

### The Prospect

On the stage of the Pearl, men have raised armies, women have raised eyebrows, and everything from yeti through trolls have made jaws drop, bellies shake with helpless laughter, and hands itch to hurl things. On a typical night, comics alternate with dancers, musicians, and acting troupes-of ten presenting satirical ballads or sketches related to recent city events. More than once Piergeiron or Khelben has been portrayed as a buffoon, to the audience's great amusement.

### The Provender

The Three Pearls offers finger food (hot sausages inside crispfried buns, pickles, and creamcoated fruit, all at $2 \mathrm{cp} /$ serving),

and drink-lots and lots of drink. Drinks are served in light clay cups that can't be thrown too far or do much damage.

A special, advertised attraction shouted out by boys at the door and on nearby streets, when available, is monster fare, such as baked stirge on toast, roast manticore, or wyvern steaks. These rarities command high prices, sometimes going for up to $7 \mathrm{gp} /$ serving. Folk buy them mainly so that they can casually claim for the rest of their lives, as  
a conversation crusher, to have eaten such-and-such. ${ }^{32}$

### The People

Too many performers of note nave trod the stage at Pearls to list them here, from the fabled bard Mintiper to the orator Phaeros "Forktongue" of Baldur's Gate.

The owner of the Pearls seldom visits her gold mine these days, but meets daily with the manager to book acts and plan publicity.

The manager, Xandos Waeve-

[^0]: ${ }^{32}$ Adventurers are paid well for fresh kills, and even more for live. The more fearsome reputation a nonhumanoid monster has, the better price it fetches. Eggs fetch a lower price, and undead, poisonous, and petrifying beasts, or human-like creatures such as trolls and ogres, are not wanted at all. Recently, the Company of the Flaming Boot sold a nearly intact, dead hatchling white dragon to the Pearls for 500 gp-a price the nightclub made back several times over by selling sizzling white dragon steaks for 10 to 20 gp each, depending on size.

rym, is known as "the Dandy" around Waterdeep: a dapper, strutting little popinjay of a man, pompous and comical-but deeply committed to entertaining, and with a keen sense of humor and a reading for what the public will go for. He oversees a staff of 14 bouncers, 16 run-andshout street boys, 12 dancers, and a house bard (currently Zalanthess-daughter-of-Zalanthar, an accomplished singer and harpist from Neverwinter).

### The Prices

There is a 3 cp cover charge at the door ( 4 to 5 cp on some special nights), and everything inside costs extra. In addition to the food, beer goes for $1 \mathrm{cp} /$ cup, house wine (very bad) for $2 \mathrm{cp} /$ cup, good wine for $1 \mathrm{sp} /$ tallglass, and zzar for $4 \mathrm{sp} /$ tallglass. ${ }^{35}$

Patrons can also buy peering glasses, which are curved glass lenses that magnify things for those far from the action, for 2 gp each. Hurl birds are also for sale for $2 \mathrm{cp} /$ each to throw at the stage to register disapproval or pleasure. These small hollow clay spheres are weighted with dried beans for good throwing and are covered with glued-on feather scraps gathered from nearby fowl-pluckers. They are too light to damage more than the dignity of performers.

Patrons also tend to spend coins by throwing them at the stage. There are no rooms for rent, and cloak storage is free. Outer garb is watchfully guarded while stored against thieves and pranksters, though patrons can pay-usually $1 \mathrm{sp} /$ message-the guards to slip a message parchment into a particular garment in order to pass notes.

There are three private boxes. These look down through windows in the ceiling at its edge where the conical central roof peak begins to rise. These small rooms can each hold up to 10 people crammed together, and can be rented for $10 \mathrm{gp} /$ evening. These have long waiting lists.

A fourth private box is reserved by the nightclub for its own use, and is often offered for free to Piergeiron or Khelben if they show up to take in an evening's fare. These two personages usually donate 25 gp or more to the club's coffers, but other dignitaries may give nothing.

### Travelers' Lore

Some say the Pearls is haunted by the phantoms of a running, weeping woman pursued by a man with a drawn sword-but I couldn't find anyone who could recall any details of this rumor, or that the haunting had been seen recently.

[^0]: ${ }^{35}$ A tallglass is just what it sounds like: a very tall, thin glass made by sealing a bone tube at the bottom with curved, fired clay. It is hard to spill and easy to carry in the crowd-but a neighbor can easily cause a drinker to choke with skillful use of an elbow when the long glass swings up!
