# Dock Ward

![img-137.jpeg](assets/Volo's%20Guide%20To%20Waterdeep_img-137.jpeg)  
erhaps the most notorious and colorful of the wards of Waterdeep, Dock Ward is known to thousands all over Faerun from travelers' tales. Most portray it as a lawless, brawling place of drunks, smugglers, roaming monsters and fell magic, where brawls are frequent.

Those tales aren't far wrong. All they leave out is the heavy city watch patrols ${ }^{1}$ and the nonstop, day-and-night work that goes on around all that fun.

The harbor is very much a working place, full of sweating, swearing dock-wallopers loading and unloading vessels, assisted by crewmen. Carts groan hastily to and from warehouses all over the southern half of the city carrying ship goods. Sightseers are not welcome.

Anyone who is crazy enough to want to tour the harbor can rent small boats from Albaeron Halembic of the Fishmongers' Fellowship at the Fish Ware-  
house. ${ }^{2}$ The cost is $4 \mathrm{gp} /$ day or 2 gp/half-day. The boat comes with oars, a small mast, two long fending poles, and a retired fisherman as skipper (who must be kept on board and in command of the vessel at all times).

Those daring or foolish enough to want to delve beneath the waters of the harbor are advised that the city guard keeps a very close watch for smugglers and items dropped for recovery by someone else later. Also, the mermen who patrol the depths do not welcome tourists, and will turn them back promptly. ${ }^{3}$

A further warning for those wishing to sightsee here: Unless the salty tang of rotting fish and sea life holds a special attraction for you, avoid the docks-or do not tarry overlong. I can attest to my cost that when the damp night and evening dew or morning mists are present and the clearing winds aren't strong, the stink of the harbor clings to your clothes and travels with you for almost a day.

[^0]
[^0]: ${ }^{1}$ City watch patrols are detailed on page 17 of FR1 Waterdeep and the North. They pass a given point about every 20 minutes and look into a tavern or inn dining room about every half-hour.

    As detailed on pages 20-22 and 23 of the City System boxed set booklet, the city guard also patrols Dock Ward in 12-man detachments. Typical patrol details are as given on page 23. Reinforcements will be another dozen LG hm F3s to F6s clad in chain mail and armed with maces, long swords, daggers, slings, and a pole arm appropriate to the situation.

    Guard patrols pass a given street location about every half-hour. They appear in 2 d 4 minutes when a city watch patrol blows a warning horn in Dock Ward.

### Lan√∞marks

All sailors who regularly sail into Waterdeep have their favorite taverns and lodgings, but all are familiar with Cookhouse Hall ${ }^{4}$, the large, echoing, hammerbeamceilinged hall where hot meals (usually roast beef, stir-fried vegetables, and a highly peppered stew) are served to all who line up and pay 2 cp for a meal. Minted drinking water is even provided. You don't have to be a sailor to eat here. It's open from dawn to dusk, and has fed many a weary (or poor or down on his luck) traveler who doesn't mind a little coarse company and dinner conversation.

The Shipmasters' Hall, by contrast, is a private inn and dining club for captains, first mates, and ship owners and their escorts only. It's very old and elegant, with polished dark wood paneling everywhere, shining brass fittings, comfortably cushioned brocade seats, and heavy plush drapes. ${ }^{5}$

One of the largest privately owned buildings in Waterdeep is the shipbuilding shed of Arnagus the Shipwright, who's crafted many of the fine ships that ply the Sword Coast. Owing to the dangers of sabotage and fire, he doesn't welcome visitors, but many folk go to the docks where the slipway from his shed runs down to the harbor to peer in at the work going on. A ship launching always draws great crowds. It's the nearest thing after brawl watching to a spectator sport that Dock Ward has. ${ }^{6}$

The following guildhalls can all be found in this ward: the Butchers' Guildhall, ${ }^{7}$ League Hall, ${ }^{8}$ Mariners' Hall, ${ }^{9}$ Watermen's Hall, ${ }^{10}$ Seaswealth Hall, ${ }^{11}$ Coopers' Rest, ${ }^{12}$ Shippers' Hall, ${ }^{13}$ Shipwrights' House, ${ }^{14}$ and the Metal House of Wonders. ${ }^{15}$

The Most Diligent League of Sail-Makers and Cordwainers has as its headquarters the Full Sails tavern. ${ }^{16}$ The Muleskull Tavern ${ }^{17}$ serves as headquarters for the Dungsweepers' Guild.

### The Hanging Lantern

Matchmaker \& Festhall

### 11111

The Lantern, an escort service known for the stunning beauty of its workers, and for the skill of its matchmakers, is famous up and down the Sword Coast.

There are many tales of clients who found a long-lost sweetheart at the Lantern or met the girl or boy of their dreams there. Merchants and the lovelorn come from up and down the Sword Coast to visit the Lantern, which is tucked into a square of shops and warehouses bounded by Shrimp Street, Pressbow Lane, Oar Alley and Ship Street. ${ }^{18}$

### The Place

The Lantern is a large, windowless building that rises a full six floors above the street. Thanks to flooding and old sewer tunnels, it has no cellars. It's dim inside, and hushed-except for the constant, gentle flute and harp music. Both the music and the sound-eating, I'm told, are due to magic.

### The Prospect

Folk come to the Lantern for just one purpose, slipping in any of its seven doors into small, intimate rooms. In each room, a  
matchmaker waits.  
There clients are interviewed, pay and are ushered into one of many narrow dark passages and stairs that leads to the room of their chosen. I'm told that not a few stabbings and stranglings occur in these dark passages when one patron lies in wait for another. Selected escorts can also meet clients by appointment. Yes, they make house calls.

The matchmakers seem expert at knowing exactly what clients want-even those who refuse to say. A wizard I met leaving the Lantern, in exchange for my promise not to name her, tells me they're not expert matchmakers, but really dopplegangers! They mind read to learn what folk like, and use their shapechanging to supply it, when their hired girls and boys can't.

The Watchful Order of Magists \& Protectors knows their secret, but preserves it, along with their lives and continued operation, in exchange for their solemn promise not to slay any guests. There are rumors of occasional evil outlander wizards disappearing at the Lantern, though.

### The People

No one, not even the Lanterns hired escorts, is sure how many matchmakers work at the Lantern. I'm told there are actually six dopplegangers, but they shift

[^0]
[^0]: ${ }^{18}$ On the color city map, the Hanging Lantern is \#262.

---

their shapes often enough to baffle any exact accounting.

The spokeswoman for the Lantern is a dignified elderly lady of rich dress and cultured manners, but its not known if this is a real person, or a shape taken by more than one 'ganger.

### The Prices

Escorts can be had for as little as 10 gp for on-the-arm service only. If acting is involved, such as playing a false part in a conversation meant to be overheard or pretending to wealth or identity in business dealings, the minimum fee is 25 gp . If more is desired, fees rise from there to a high of around 75 gp . The matchmakers have an uncanny ability to know how much a client can pay. Discretion is assured.

If a client just wants to hire bodies-a group of folk to accompany her on a stroll or tavern crawl through Dock Ward, say as a bodyguard party, or to fool someone into thinking the client is part of a group or has lots of friends - they can be had for as little as 7 to 9 gp / head per evening. The Lantern has a call list of those down on their luck, and charges 3 gp for the trouble of sending a runner boy for them and providing suitable garb.

### Travelers' Lore

The business the Lantern do forces it to deal in a little-known  
![img-138.jpeg](assets/Volo's%20Guide%20To%20Waterdeep_img-138.jpeg)  
sideline. Its the closest thing to a costume rental service Waterdeep has, providing fooling clothing for many occasions. Costumes are sometimes rented out, typically for 1 gp per night. Renters must pay for replacement of any damaged garments.

There are many many tales of finding long-lost heartmates here (thanks to the shapeshifting of the 'gangers), but there are also rumors that drugged captives are kept here to await a slavers' ship or recovery by kidnap gangs. I saw no evidence of that - but I did see carried out the body of an unfortunate merchant who'd met a creditor on the stairs and been a bit too slow with his dagger.

### Helmstar Warehouse

Facing the full fury of winter sea storms howling across the harbor, this warehouse stands on Dock Street, on the northeast corner of its junction with Crookedclaw Alley. ${ }^{19}$

### The Place

This old, slightly leaning stone structure looks most impressivein a worn, seedy way. Its carved harpies and wyverns, encrusted with white caps of bird droppings, glare down endlessly on the bustle of the docks.

### The Prospect

The Helmstar Warehouse is presently run by one of the third generation of Helmstars to trade on the docks of Waterdeep: Chuldan Helmstar.

Chuldan is one of the betterknown fences of Waterdeep. He buys carvings and statuary of all sorts, no matter how recognizable and hot, for $35 \%$ of the current new-made market price. No value is given for any enchantments on or magical powers of items, only on their material, size, and workmanship.

Chuldan is one of very few Waterdhavians allowed by the guilds involved to hold dual membership in guilds that are  
of ten competitors: the Fellowship of Salters, Packers, and Joiners and the Guild of Watermen. He maintains this rare position by handsome annual payments over and above his dues to both guilds. It allows him to carry on his illicit trade, which is the great majority of his business. Stolen goods find shipboard ways out of Waterdeep in a variety of ingenious packagings devised and constructed by Chuldan and his skilled, discreet staff of fourteen.

### The People

Chuldan is a close-mouthed, birdlike, suspicious man with jet black eyes and hair. Always expecting double-dealing and betrayal, he is steps ahead of foes with contingency plans, escape routes, and surprises up one's sleeve-and seems satisfied when such deceits occur, as if they confirm his forethought and views on the true natures of all intelligent races.

### The Prices

Chuldan deals in the handling of small cargo, from six barrels or a noble's coach to individual crates bound for friends and colleagues up and down the Sword Coast. His rates are high ( 2 to 6 gp per container), and he guarantees only same-season delivery. However, he has a large clientele, because he is discreet, takes extra

![img-139.jpeg](assets/Volo's%20Guide%20To%20Waterdeep_img-139.jpeg)  
care in packing to ensure cargo safety and undertakes to threaten, trace, check on, and otherwise persuade hired carriers to make sure cargo they take coin from him to deliver is in fact delivered to the right party as soon as possible.

### Travelers' Lore

Few bother Chuldan, his goods, or his staff-word of his defenses and means of vengeance has spread. The high-vaulted, crowded warehouse is guarded by a band of margoyles whose loyalty to Chuldan seems unshakable. No one knows exactly how many of these creatures are  
lurking around the warehouse and Chuldan's rooftop apartments, or by what means he controls them. They hunt down any who molest him, trespass, or try to steal.

On occasions Chuldan has found it necessary to explain certain things to professionally curious men of the city watch. Usually his explanations concern a severed head, newly added to the end of a row of withered fellow trophies above Chuldan's front counter. Chuldan's words tend to reflect the view that this latest head, like the earlier ones, came in a recently unloaded cargo from far and barbarous

lands, and has something to do, he understands, with barbarian beliefs about guardian spirits that watch over goods while they travel afar. That certain of the heads seem familiar, closely resembling recently vanished rogues and ruffians of the city is something that troubles, puzzles, and indeed mystifies Chuldan over and over again.

Chuldan invites all passersby to poke their noses into his warehouse to see the care he takes over cargo and the speed and volume of his business. He hopes (correctly) that many will be impressed - either to use his services or to refrain from trying to steal from him.

The lore of Dock Ward says the ghost of Chuldan's famous adventuring father, the bearded and brawling warrior Thalagar, drifts around the warehouse-its sewer door, in particular-in tattered splint mail, battle axe in hands, defending Helmstar territory. The ghost is said to have routed more than one thieving band who used magic to neutralize the margoyles. Thalagar especially hated lizard men, and on certain mist-shrouded nights, old sailors say he can be seen striding silently but speedily along the length of Dock Street, storm-like of visage, axe in hand. ${ }^{20}$

Some of the carvings on the second floor ledge and roof of  
![img-140.jpeg](assets/Volo's%20Guide%20To%20Waterdeep_img-140.jpeg)  
the warehouse are crumbling away. A shattered, fallen harpy was recently found on Dock Street one morning below its customary perch. Under it was the flattened body of an unfortunate thief, still clutching the climbing line that had pulled the carving down atop her. Chuldan Helmstar had the missing rooftop carving replaced with a detailed carving that shows a crouching, terrified-looking human female in leathers holding one end of a climbing cord, and took great pleasure in pointing it out to visitors for the next few rides.

[^0]
[^0]: ${ }^{20}$ These are always nights when lizard men have come near the harbor (as crew, captives, passengers, or visitors - perhaps disguised - to the city).

### The Old Xoblob Shop

![img-142.jpeg](assets/Volo's%20Guide%20To%20Waterdeep_img-142.jpeg)

The Old Xoblob Shop is a curio shop little known outside Waterdeep, but famous in the city for its trophies of battle, adventuring bands, and exotic, faraway places. From drow sculptures to the huge, eyeless, stuffed beholder that overhangs everything, the shop is crammed with an untidy assortment of blades, treasure maps, coils of rope hundreds of feet long, statuettes of forgotten make and mysterious origin, and  
more. The shop is named for the beholder, killed by the proprietor in single combat long ago. Xoblob is all he could pronounce of its name.

This treasure trove is next door to the Purple Palace festhall, on the northwest corner of the meeting of Fillet Lane and Slut Street. Just two doors down from the Dock Ward outlet of Aurora's Realms Shop Catalogue Counter, the Old Xoblob Shop carries all the things the catalogue chain doesn't, from lizard man tribal boundary marking poles to dwarven runestones bearing treasure messages. For adventurers and con artists, it's the place to find all those necessary props  
![img-143.jpeg](assets/Volo's%20Guide%20To%20Waterdeep_img-143.jpeg)

that no one else sells anywhere! The Place  
The Old Xoblob Shop is a tall, ugly old stone and timber building. Windows are few and dust is plentiful. The street-level floor of the interior is the shop, one huge room with exposed ceiling beams supported by an irregular forest of pillars. One of the pillars, I'm told, is hollow. The jolly proprietor, Dandalus, sometimes uses it to hide shoppers on the run from the city watch or foes, keeping a display rack holding two glowing human skeletons in there the rest of the time.

A stair hidden behind the serving counter leads down to a high-ceilinged basement, containing a bucket flush jakes, which is connected to the sewers via foottreadle trapdoor, a kitchen, and a row of huge wine casks. Dandalus does make his own wine, but one of the casks is hollow. Its front swings open to reveal a hidden room where folk on the run can hide for a fee. A kitchen cupboard has a sliding back opening into the cask, allowing a small person room to squirm out of it or food and drink to be passed in.

Dandulus sells his wine for 2 $\mathrm{sp} /$ glass or $1 \mathrm{gp} /$ bottle. He makes a sparkling green among the best wines I've ever tasted. It's worth 10 times what he asks for it.

A broad stair leads up from the shop to a landing, where a narrow stair leads on up to the top floor. Dandalus and his wife live on the top floor in a suite of rooms connected to a roof garden. The landing also opens into a large storage loft that fills the second floor. It is windowless, has a 60 -foot-high ceiling, and is usually nearly empty - a good thing, too, because a teleport from a certain spot on the second level of the dungeon of Undermountain brings adventurers (and sometimes monsters!) here. ${ }^{21}$ The chamber is lit by a driftlight (glowing globe), and contains an alarm-gong that rings whenever any weight is added to the room's floor.

Dandalus usually calls out cheerfully "Come down smiling! No weapons out, please!" He also, just in case, reaches under the counter for his wand of paralyzation. He has standing arrangements with Khelben Arunsun and with the manager of the Three Pearls Nightclub, Xandos Waeverym, for the disposal of paralyzed monsters. Adventurers are usually relieved of their weapons, and obvious spellcasters are hand-hobbled and hooded before the paralysis wears off. If the shop is closed, Dandalus or his wife will be upstairs, the wand with them,

![img-144.jpeg](assets/Volo's%20Guide%20To%20Waterdeep_img-144.jpeg)  
and will act the same. I'm told Dandalus has a backup wand that deals damage of some sort. ${ }^{22}$

The top floor apartments are private, but I've learned herbs are grown on the roof, that there is a little bower there for relaxing and romance on soft-starred summer nights, and that the third floor contains at least two guest bedrooms.

### The Prospect

The Old Xoblob Shop is perhaps the best source of curios, tro-  
phies, and out-of-the-ordinary adventurers' gear in six worlds according to Khelben, ${ }^{23}$ and the wine there is also first-rate. Dandalus cheerfully buys all sorts of bric-a-brac, paying a sixth of its worth. He is especially fond of things he can resell as spell components-or as genuine, noguarantees magic items.

The shop is not a good place for thieves or the belligerent. The stuffed beholder is hollow, and conceals a hired wizard who can fire a wand of paralyzation out of its mouth to take customers by surprise. (Yes, this is a second wand of the same type. For all I know, Dandalus has a box of them under the bed upstairs!) Dandalus himself is a walking arsenal of magic, his wife has surprises of her own, and the shop bristles with concealed boobytraps to deter miscreants, including some Dandalus can trigger from afar. The shop also sports some not-so-hidden protections, such as an iron golem, Guraim the Gentle Persuader; who stands in a corner of the shop, spending most of his time as a rack for colored, scented candles.

### The People

Dandalus "Fire-Eye" Ruell is a balding, bearded, big-bellied

[^0]
[^0]: ${ }^{22}$ This backup wand, Elminster reveals (he made it), is a special wand of magic missiles. Each triggering releases a burst of either 6 or 12 bolts (as the wielder mentally directs: half or full power). The wand is linked to three other wands hidden inside a wall of the shop and can call on their charges via a special linkage-so each missile drains a charge in the usual way, but the wand in effect has 300 extra charges to expend!  
    ${ }^{23}$ Elminster agrees.

---

fellow who's always cheerful and sees life for the long running joke that it so often is. He makes no enemies. Those who attack or swindle him he merely charges double or more. He is always clad in breeches with bulging pockets, sometimes overlaid by an apron whose pockets are just as crammed. The pockets' contents always include a selection of lockpicks, skeleton keys, small tools, and garment pins for distressed ladies with torn garb. ${ }^{24}$

Arathka Ruell (lovingly called Rella by Dandalus) tends to the cleaning and cooking, but is just as charming and learned a shopkeeper as her man, if quieter. Unlike Dandalus, she doesn't dispense bad jokes and puns by the dozen. She's a priestess of some sort, but I never learned what power she serves. She's not forthcoming about it. ${ }^{25}$

The wizard hired by the Ruells is an ugly one-legged, misshapen, and therefore very shy, little man who is fiercely loyal and protective of his employers. ${ }^{26}$ His name is Hlondaglus Shrim, and he spends all the time the shop is open, from an hour after dawn to two hours after dusk, up in the beholder, eating sandwiches and whittling. He's the source of occasional showers of shavings that drift down to settle on shoppers and shop alike.

### Travelers' Lore

The wares in this shop have their own lore, hundreds of little tales of dark magic, betrayal, and wild adventures. The shop itself is well-known to neighbors for the deeds of Dandalus, such as the time he wrestled a mimic to death in the street outside and the time a lich came through the gate. Spells in plenty burst out the windows of the shop before the undead creature was destroyed (by Arathka, the whispers say).

Dandalus refuses to go adventuring, but has been known to come to the rescue of friends and long-time customers trapped in Undermountain. He once waded into a brawl started by half-orcs in a nearby tavern, the Sleeping Wench, and laid out every combatant involved. When an arriving watch patrol mistook him for the source of the trouble, he laid them all out cold too. (Once the matter was settled, he treated the patrol to some of his wine.)

This is definitely a shop to collect such tales. Dandalus can tell you the lore or supposed lore of most of what he sells, and can recall the deeds of adventurers in and around Waterdeep for the last 30 years or so. He likes to talk. Those looking for treasure leads should pay him a visit and buy wine to talk over.

[^0]
[^0]: ${ }^{24}$ For details of the arsenal of magic Dandalus carries on his person, see the "Folk of Waterdeep" appendix at the back of this book.  
    ${ }^{25}$ The "Folk of Waterdeep" section also speaks of Arathka's faith and powers. Elminster knows all.  
    ${ }^{26}$ Any attempts to charm Hlondaglus to do anything hostile or harmful to the Ruells will automatically break the spell and goad Hlondaglus into a killing rage.

### Serpent Books \& Folios

### 11111

This is one of the dustiest but most exclusive shops in Waterdeep. Some have called it the single best source of maps, charts, and books in all the Realms-and most wizards I've known agree. Located in a modest sandstone shopfront on the east side of Book Street, ${ }^{27}$ Jannaxil Serpentil's shop is frequented by those who have come from afar in search of the rare, the unusual-and a chance to sell stolen goods.

### The Place

The battered Serpentil sign hangs above an old, unkempt stone building whose wares window is boarded over, and whose black door entry is always forbiddingly closed. (When Jannaxil is open for business, a small, sliding viewing panel in the upper part of the door is left open.) Magical guardian glyphs adorn both the boards and the doors and glow faintly after dark. Few care to try their power.

Inside, the shop is very dark. It is crammed with deep-hued bookshelves, and the walls are paneled with wood. The sole light here comes from magical glowing globes that drift about at

Serpentil's will. Powerful fireguards spells prevent anything from igniting.

Aside from Jannaxil's desk and three chairs (two for visitors), books are the furnishings of this shop. More books are piled and shelved together here than most folk of Faerun will ever see.

### The Prospect

Jannaxil handles all sorts of printed materials, from magical tomes to maps and charts of the Sword Coast waters. He likes to warn folk sagely that spellbooks give off green flames when they burn. Magical tomes and Sword Coast maps are his two specialties, but he can also find you a tome of folktales of Cormyr or the collected ballads of the longdead bard Delshryn of Mirabar.

Jannaxil also buys printed lore, and is a cold, hard haggler. He gives $30 \%$ of the market value of all items he knows to be stolen. If any sort of literary theft occurs in Waterdeep, he typically knows about it by the next day!

### The People

Most people think of Jannaxil Serpentil as just a nasty, coldmannered old scholar, but from earlier magical researches I know him to be at least a dabbler in magic and far older than he looks. He is no doubt protected by magic, and has been known to

clutch a certain slim black volume to his breast when attacked in his shop. Most folk think its just his account book-but I think it contains a tome guardian ${ }^{28}$ monster that he uses to protect himself. There is much of the coward about him.

If Jannaxil has any family or staff, none have ever seen them. He is thought to sleep above his shop, in windowless apartments. Rumor says they include a large spellcasting chamber where Jannaxil conjures up baatezu to do his bidding.

### The Prices

No deals with Jannaxil come cheap. Even the shabbiest chapbook will set you back at least 1 gp. Shoplifters are warned that Jannaxil has some way of knowing when one of his wares is leaving unpaid for, and that a binding spell prevents the guilty party from exiting. Jannaxil never confronts anyone, but simply waits for them to remove the hidden object and either pay for it or set it down and leave.

Most useful tomes, such as engineering instructions, math-

[^0]: ${ }^{28}$ The tome guardian monster is detailed in the sourcebook FR4 The Magister. Jannaxil might well have trained or allied monsters, too, such as watchspiders (detailed in FOR2 The Drow of the Underdark and in The Ruins of Undermountain boxed set) and mimics.

![img-146.jpeg](assets/Volo's%20Guide%20To%20Waterdeep_img-146.jpeg)  
ematical texts, noble family histories, and detailed studies of the geography and history of a particular area, cost 15 to 50 gp .

Spellbooks are in unreliable supply, of course, and are purchased as is, with no guarantees as to the absence of curses or the efficacy of the spells within. Jannaxil typically charges a base price of 50 gp for each one plus 300 gp per spell or spell fragment contained within. Spells of the fourth or greater level command a surcharge of 1000 gp per spell. Spells of 7 th level and up add 3000 gp each to the cost of a book. It is likely Jannaxil copies the useful spells from books he sells for himself, but no one has ever  
found his cache of magic. Locals talk in the taverns of long crawltunnels where guardian monsters lurk, leading to a private study where Jannaxil keeps powerful magic.

Jannaxil does book searches for a deposit of 10 gp plus 4 gp per year thereafter. If the book is found, he charges double the usual price for it.

Papers (accounts and letters) find their way most often to Jannaxil's shop. He does a brisk business in blackmailing Waterdhavians with love letters and the like that a malicious or careless person sold to him. Jannaxil typically buys such wares for 1 to 5 copper pieces a
