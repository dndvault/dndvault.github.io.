I needed a quick travel way of determining how far a party would be able to travel around the **Sword Coast area**. The internet and the sources I have available is pretty vague on the actual distances, and different maps give different measures. I’ve based the following distances on the [Sword Coast map from 4E](http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Faer%C3%BBn). Night’s End is a village of my own design that lies a couple of days east of **Luskan** along the **River Mirar**. The following tables is in kilometers:

### Walking Distance in km

|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
||**Luskan**|**Port Llast**|**Neverwinter**|**Night’s End**|**Leilon**|**Waterdeep**|**Mirabar**|
|###### **Luskan**|0|112|190|96|334|654|380|
|###### **Port Llast**|112|0|80|208|224|544|492|
|###### **Neverwinter**|190|80|0|286|144|464|570|
|###### **Night’s End**|96|208|286|0|430|750|284|
|###### **Leilon**|334|224|144|430|0|320|714|
|###### **Waterdeep**|654|544|478|844|320|0|1034|
|###### **Mirabar**|380|492|570|284|714|1034|0|

The typical walking speed per day if lightly encumbered is around 5 km/hour. With a few breaks that ends up around 30km / day. It can be pushed up to 40 km / day but with with the risk of injury or fatigue. A cautious party would travel half the normal speed at 15 km / day. The quick table below shows time between locations when moving at 30 km / day:

### Walking distance in Days

|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
||**Luskan**|**Port Llast**|**Neverwinter**|**Night’s End**|**Leion**|**Waterdeep**|**Mirabar**|
|###### **Luskan**|0|4|6|3|11|22|13|
|###### **Port Llast**|4|0|3|7|7|18|16|
|###### **Neverwinter**|6|3|0|10|5|15|19|
|###### **Night’s End**|3|7|10|0|14|25|9|
|###### **Leilon**|11|7|5|14|0|11|24|
|###### **Waterdeep**|22|18|16|28|11|0|34|
|###### **Mirabar**|13|16|19|9|24|34|0|

The numbers are rounded down and is a little bit on the positive side as it does not take elevation, weather, encounters, or road conditions into consideration. I would be assuming that the adventurers would be on the road 6-7 hours, have a lunch break, setup camp and have time to do a little foraging/hunting if environment allows it.
