This is a note  about a homebrew vampire species that can be used both as a player race as well as npc or enemies. It is not a revised vampirism but a complete overhaul, as the vanilla version present in 5e and other rulesets makes vampires very hard to balance, as they are not meant to be a playable race.
This version also attempts to tackle several other issues that make vampires a notoriously difficult player race - like the slave-master dynamic between newborn and adult vampires that would require a lot of rulebending for a player to be able to be an autonomous spawn.

Apart from rules and technicalities, this vampire origin attempts to provide unique lore about the origin of vampires and integrate them into the ecosystem of the Swordcoast.

Unlike the solitary, cursed figures of legend, this lineage of vampires thrives within a complex, hive-like social structure. Their existence is deeply intertwined with their distinct biology, their ancient, often forgotten history, and their sometimes fraught interactions with other species across the realms. To understand these creatures is to delve into the very fabric of their being, from their instinctive bonds to the roles dictated by age and life span.

### Key Differences and Design Philosophy

This homebrew ruleset represents a significant departure from the standard vampires and vampire spawn presented in the Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition Monster Manual and related official sources. These changes were made with specific goals in mind: to address balance issues inherent in standard vampires (particularly for potential player characters), to create a playable and autonomous vampire lineage distinct from the typical master-slave dynamic, and to provide unique lore that grounds these creatures within the world's ecosystem. This gives players the option to opt into a vampirism origin much like any other race, but also adds a little bit of danger and randomness to it.

The primary divergences include:

*   **Origin and Biology:** Standard vampires are typically created by a curse or through a specific ritual involving another vampire, resulting in an undead state powered by negative energy. This homebrew lineage is instead rooted in a blend of ancient cave-dwelling feykind and humanoids that have been afflicted by the Shadowfell. While the first vampires were technically cursed, this is a separate matter to vampirism itself. Vampirism was, in this case, an attempt to *cure* a much worse affliction, but has by now long gone past the stage of fixing the original problem, and has become somewhat its own can of worms.
*   **Fey-Undead Blend Potential:** The combination of Fey ancestry and an Undead type is often overlooked or deemed somewhat impossible in traditional lore. This lineage explores the narrative and mechanical potential of such a blend, allowing for unique interactions with magic, environments, and other creature types that respond specifically to either Fey or Undead traits. This offers an untapped avenue for integrating vampires into existing Forgotten Realms lore and creating novel story hooks.
*   **Playable Lifecycle Stages:** The standard Vampire Spawn is often presented as a creature bound to its creator, lacking free will. This homebrew introduces distinct life cycle stages (Newborn, Adolescent, Adult, Elder) that offer different capabilities and social roles, designed specifically to allow player characters to progress and function autonomously within society, albeit with unique dependencies.


###  History and Origins

Though the precise origin is often lost to time, this lineage is believed to stem from a blend of ancient cave-dwelling feykind (possibly a bat-like monstrosity) and humanoids. It is whispered that a long time ago, a profound affliction from the Shadowfell twisted a group of humanoids, rendering them infertile and granting them a form of magical immortality. However, this immortality came at a terrible cost: their bodies began to decay, becoming gaunt and zombie-like, causing them to be ostracized from their communities. Driven from their homes and unable to perpetuate their lines through conventional means, they sought refuge or aid in the deep places of the world. Here, they encountered ancient cave-dwelling fey. A pact or magical mingling occurred, offering these decaying humans an alternate way to have children and, crucially, a way to halt their physical deterioration and gain a (shallow, cosmetic illusion of ) youthful form and vigor, allowing them to blend in with humanoid society once more. This blend instilled them with faewild traits and dependencies, trading one form of supernatural existence for another. Their biology, including the adaptations to low-oxygen, low-light subterranean environments, and their often pale, almost albino-like appearance, originates from their cave-dwelling fey predecessors. In order to keep the fae magic alive, vampires need to feed - fresh blood and raw meat from any non-undead creature will suffice, but many have a preference for their personal source, like pig blood, blood from cows, deer, and sometimes blood from humans. Since they do feed frequently but only draw a small volume, they do not have to kill to sustain themselves. Without blood, the shadowfell might corrupt them once again, causing decay, hair loss, and chronic agony. Even just a few weeks without blood might render a vampire into a ghoul-like zombie.

### Procreation

Unlike most humanoids, this vampiric lineage does not reproduce among themselves. Instead, Adult vampires (Sires) possess the unique, unsettling ability to mingle with living humanoids, sexually transferring a dormant genetic trait, but without fathering (or bearing) their own children. The human "host", now carrying this trait lifelong, will typically conceive and bear offspring with other humanoids and will not arouse any suspicion, but the resulting children will secretly possess the dormant vampiric potential. These children appear entirely normal at birth and during early life, growing and developing according to their humanoid parentage until such a time as the dormant vampirism is triggered, leading to their own transformation into a Newborn Spawn (see Life Cycle Stages). This method of procreation is believed to be inherited from their cave-dwelling fey ancestors, allowing the lineage to persist and even expand by utilizing the reproductive cycles of other species. It is to be believed that the fey might have used bats as their "host species" before, which would explain their shapeshifting abilities. 

It also creates a complex dynamic where some humanoids are unaware they carry or have borne vampiric descendants, while others may be unwilling participants in the lineage's perpetuation. Crucially, from the perspective of the fey involved in the ancient pact, this was not a malicious act to "trick" anyone involved in this kind of procreation, but simply their practical way of "correcting" the humanoids' infertility, using a method of procreation that felt familiar and natural to the fey. The outcome was, of course, not what the shadowfell-afflicted humans had in mind, but a wish granted cannot be undone.

After centuries of human-vampiric relations, things get more muddy and there are many people with some traces of vampirism in their ancestry. When those with dormant vampirism reach their twenties, they *might* transform if they are close to death - this depends on how recently their bloodline was touched by vampirism. However, this depends on many factors. Some humanoids might spend their life not knowing about their vampirism at all, but then go on to have grandchildren who end up becoming full vampires. Like this, vampirism can seem unpredictable and random, and there are dozens of theories on why and how someone becomes a vampire. Due to vampires needing living blood to sustain their fae-gifted youth, many believe that their bites are what makes someone a vampire. Due to the possibility of corpses coming back to life, wooden stakes are driven through bodies before burial. This traps a newborn in a perpetual regeneration cycle -  a cruel practice that has since been outlawed in some places.

### Society and Hierarchy

Vampires form strong, instinctive bonds within their hive, recognizing members by scent and appearance. Their society follows a strict hierarchy based primarily on age:


* **Newborns (Years 0 - ~80):** The most vulnerable stage, dependent on older vampires for feeding and Protektion, particularly during the initial critical weeks. They serve as workers within the hive, tending to livestock and maintaining the territory. They struggle with separation anxiety and exhibit subservient behavior towards their guardians. High mortality rate in the first decades. 
* **Adolescents (~80-200 years):** Upon reaching this stage, they undergo a second 'cocooning' and assume roles as guardians and caretakers within the spawngrounds. They nurse newborns, protect the hive, and manage resources. They form close bonds with peers and exhibit protective instincts, especially towards newborn spawn. They show little intrinsic interest in human
* **Adults (Sires):** The oldest and most powerful, capable of procreation with humanoids to pass on the dormant trait. They are often nomadic, expanding territory and traveling with Scouts (older adolescents). They are highly territorial and assertive, often regarding other adults as competition. Elders (>500 years) settle in their latest hive, entering increasing (eventually permanent) stasis.
* **Elders (>600 years):** The oldest vampires. They typically settle, enter deep stasis, and are guarded by the hive. Dying elders' bodies petrify. Some might be so old that they were one of the original, 'first born' vampires. While they can not truly "die", this is the closest they can get to it.

The hierarchy is instinctive and strong, vital for colony stability, even when sires are absent. Challenges to dominance by younger adults are rare but often result in deadly conflict. Resource scarcity, especially in modern urban environments, can strain this structure, leading to difficult decisions by adolescents about the fate of weak newborns and sometimes desperate acts by individuals.

### Gender Roles

Vampiric society possesses a fluid concept of gender and procreation. Family structures do not rely on heterosexuality or traditional parent roles; the young are raised communally by older siblings, and labor is divided by age. While newborns may initially adhere to their human-assigned gender, the concept loses significance over decades. Clothing and mannerisms become fluid, and older vampires are often androgynous. Hair length can symbolize age and status, with adults often maintaining long hair. This is especially important in the context of the skin rot and subsequent hair loss that happens due to the shadow curse - a well maintained long ponytail shows that a vampire has managed to feed on fresh blood every day for a long time, and has not starved in decades. 

**Biological Sex:** Due to their method of procreation through human hosts rather than internal reproduction, adult vampires of this lineage lose the need for and development of traditional humanoid reproductive organs. Their biology converges over time, resulting in an endocrine system that is functionally uniform across the species regardless of sex assigned at birth. While they may retain the superficial characteristics of their humanoid sex for some time post-transformation, their underlying biological systems become functionally the same as they mature, rendering humanoid concepts of male/female biological sex largely irrelevant within the hive structure. In some cases, adult vampires might be hard to separate based on sex characteristics.



### Life Cycle Stages

1.  **Dormant Vampirism:** The latent state in humanoids carrying the genetic trait. Grants subtle spectral perception and slightly harder detection by biology. Can be triggered into full transformation when the "host" experiences significant levels of traumatic injury or near death.
2.  **Stage I: Cocooning (Initial Days):** The transformation from a dormant host into a Newborn Spawn is a traumatic and violent metamorphosis, typically triggered when the host is on the brink of death or has just perished. This near-death state activates two powerful, conflicting legacies within their blood: the Shadowfell curse that grants them a twisted form of immortality, and the ancient fey "counter-curse" that fights to preserve a semblance of life. The process begins as the host's body succumbs to the Shadowfell's influence, entering a death-like stasis. To an outside observer, the host is dead. Their heart stops, their body grows cold, and a zombie-like decay sets in as the skin begins to slough away. During this period, their original teeth loosen and fall out, leaving them in a ghoulish state. This is the host body truly dying. Just as the Shadowfell curse threatens to consume them entirely, the fey ancestry awakens, sparking a miraculous and horrifying revivification. The fey magic acts as a biological artisan, rebuilding the decaying form from the inside out. It replaces the lost teeth with sharp, predatory fangs. New layers of skin form beneath the old, which is shed like a grotesque cocoon. Identifying features like scars and tattoos fade, only to be imperfectly restored by the fey magic, often leaving the newborn looking subtly "off" or uncanny to those who knew them in their old life. This entire process can take several days, during which the transforming individual is completely vulnerable, trapped within their own dying and rebirthing body. 
3.  **Spawnhood/Infancy (Years 0 - ~80):** Physically frozen appearance. High dependency on older vampires for blood (nursing). Fangs fully develop (~14-20mm) and lower jaw venom fangs emerge (~90-100 years), marks transition to Adolescent in medical terms). Digestive system adapts to blood/raw meat. Ectothermic, seek warmth. Develop Spectral Sight, partial color blindness. .
4.  **Adolescence (~80 - 200 years):** Second cocooning stage. As they come to the end of a normal human life span, their youthful human bodies become harder to maintain and are slowly fully replaced by fae magic. While newborns still retain some organs and body functions from their life before transformation, adolescents now rely entirely on the blood pact that keeps them from decaying. Their role inside vampire society shifts to guardian/caretaker. Gains Venom Fangs (if not already), Pack Tactics, Protective Instinct, stronger Spectral Sense.
5.  **Adulthood (>200 years):** Final cocooning, where now even their bones are replaced. Now as adult vampires with their bodies fully altered by magic, they can dip into the shapeshifting powers gifted to them by their ancestry. Can hunt large mammals independently. More solitary and territorial. Gains Territorial trait, potent Bite/Claw attacks, Grapple. Shapechanger (Normal Bat or Large Monstrous Bat form) becomes available.
6.  **Elder (>500 years):** Settle in a hive, enter increasing stasis. Eventually permanent stasis and physical petrification, leading to death.


### Regeneration and Defeat

This lineage of vampires does not possess the rapid, near-instantaneous regeneration often associated with standard vampires. Instead, their healing is tied to a state of **stasis**, a form of torpor they can enter when incapacitated or choosing to rest deeply. While in this incapacitated stasis state, they regain hit points at the start of their turn, provided they have at least 1 hit point. They are notoriously difficult to dispose of, so much so that entire professions have formed around the art of vampire killing. 

**Halting Regeneration:** The stasis-based regeneration is immediately halted if an object is lodged in their head or torso. This does not need to be a wooden stake, though that certainly suffices; any solid object that remains impaled in these critical areas will prevent them from healing in this manner. Removing the lodged object allows their stasis regeneration to resume if they are still incapacitated and have hit points remaining. If the object is lodged long enough and three consecutive death saves are failed, a vampire dies. Due to the inherent vulnerability of vampiric stasis, vampires usually sleep in groups and take turns as guards. Vampires who are awake during the day to defend their fellow kind from intruders are often referred to as "Daywatchers" and are to be avoided.

**Incapacitation vs. Defeat:** Reducing a vampire of this lineage to 0 hit points renders them incapacitated and sends them into stasis, but does not necessarily kill them if their regeneration can still function. A vampire at 0 hit points with no object lodged in their head or torso will begin to regenerate. 

**Achieving Final Defeat:** To truly destroy a vampire of this lineage, one must ensure their regeneration is halted *while* they are at 0 hit points. Otherwise they will regain hitpoints at the same rate as they will lose them, which is torturous and cruel,  but not lethal. The most common methods to ensure permanent defeat include:

*   **Impalement and Incapacitation:** Reducing the vampire to 0 hit points and leaving a substantial object (such as a stake, sword, or spear) lodged in their head or torso. While incapacitated and unable to regenerate, they remain at 0 hit points and are vulnerable. After a period determined by the DM (typically hours or days, depending on the vampire's age and the nature of the injury), their form will eventually break down or petrify, leading to final destruction.
*   **Radiant or Cold Damage while Incapacitated:** While at 0 hit points and incapacitated, the vampire retains its vulnerabilities. Delivering a significant amount of Radiant or Cold damage to them in this state (such as holding them in direct sunlight or dousing them with holy water while staked) can overwhelm their weakened form and cause their final destruction. The amount of damage required should be proportional to their Challenge Rating or remaining hit points if their max HP were somehow tracked while at 0.
*   **Decapitation and Fire:** Severing the head and burning it prevents any chance of regeneration. 
*   **Natural Decline (Elders):** Elders of this lineage eventually enter a permanent state of stasis that leads to irreversible physical petrification and a form of biological 'death' over centuries.

**Note:** Unlike standard D&D vampires, direct exposure to sunlight is debilitating but not instantly lethal. Running water does not cause damage but acts as a significant barrier due to their Territorial Constraint, making crossing rivers that serve as borders difficult. Holy water and Radiant damage function as outlined in their vulnerabilities. Spells or effects targeting "Living" creatures have no effect on them due to their Vampiric Nature (Undead typing).



## Custom Vampire Lineage Summary

This lineage of vampires originates from a blend of cave-dwelling feykind (potentially bat-like) and humanoids, possibly stemming from a long-lost pact. Their nature is more biological than purely undead, though they are mechanically typed as Undead for rules compatibility.

**Life Cycle Stages:**
*   **Dormant Host:** Individuals of other races carrying latent vampiric ancestry. They use their original race's stats and traits, gaining subtle spectral perception and a slight bonus to stealth related to biology. They risk transforming into a Newborn Spawn under significant stress.
*   **Newborn Spawn:** The first stage after full transformation. Vulnerable and dependent, but possessing the core biological traits. Mortality rate is high due to violence and other factors.
*   **Adolescent Vampire:** A stronger, more capable stage, gaining venomous fangs and Pack Tactics.
*   **Adult Vampire:** The primary mature stage, significantly more powerful, territorial, and capable of transforming into a Monstrous Bat.
*   **Elder Vampire:** Extremely old vampires, typically found in deep stasis. Narrative figures and powerful threats, often with unique lair effects.

**Meta-Commentary: Key Divergences from Standard D&D Vampire Lore**

This lineage differs significantly from standard D&D vampires:
*   **Origin & Biology:** Fey-humanoid blend origin, vampirism as a "counter-curse" that comes with its own side effects. Akin to a chronic condition that can be passed on genetically.
*   **Dormant Vampirism:** Anyone could become a vampire. 
*   **Sunlight:** Debilitating (disadvantage), in hot summers it can cause radiant damage, but not instantly lethal. Sunlight also causes temporary Blindness and Confusion. With proper protection, Vampires can go outside during the day, but they *will* complain about it.
*   **Warmth-seeking**: Due to their bodies being unable to produce their own heat, vampires need to find sources of warmth while they sleep or go into stasis so their limbs don't stiffen up. In some cases, vampires have disadvantage or even penalty on Dexterity rolls if they long rest without a heat source nearby.
*   **Healing:** Stasis regeneration halted by lodged objects, reduced magical healing without feeding.
*   **Adults and Spawn:** Biological dependency, not a "thrall" or slave. However, newborns can also be raised by humans or other species.  
*   **Life Cycle:** Defined stages (Newborn, Adolescent, Adult, Elder) with distinct forms and abilities.
*   **Sensory/Habitat:** Spectral Sight, use of Underdark pigments for cultural script, preference for subterranean environments.
*   **Weaknesses:** Territoriality/taboo for entry/running water (as border), lodged object for regeneration instead of just stake/heart, standard holy water/radiant applies.
*   **Shapechanger:** Bat form flavored as fey ancestry; includes a Large Monstrous Bat form for boss fights.
*   **Alignment:** Not inherently evil; actions determined by individual choice, need, and society.

## Optional Trait: Dormant Vampirism

You carry the latent potential of your vampiric ancestry within you, though it has not yet fully manifested. This may be due to a distant ancestor or a recent, unknown exposure. Choosing this trait means you are currently a member of your original race (Human, Elf, Dwarf, etc.) and use their statistics, *except* for the features granted by this trait. You may transform into a Newborn Spawn under specific circumstances (see below).

*   **Subtle Spectral Perception:** You have a faint connection to the spectral frequencies. You gain advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks made to discern subtle details or notice hidden things in dim light or darkness that creatures without Spectral Sight might miss.
*   **Risk of Transformation:** Your lineage carries the risk of full vampiric transformation. Upon experiencing a significant stressor (such as dropping to 0 hit points, gaining multiple levels of exhaustion, or suffering a profound physical or psychological trauma), the DM may determine that the Dormant Vampirism begins to manifest. This can lead to gaining additional traits from the Newborn Spawn list over time, or a sudden, traumatic transformation into a Newborn Spawn. If you transform, you lose the traits of your original race and gain the full set of Newborn Spawn traits (excluding this Dormant Vampirism trait). The DM will guide this process.
*   **Imperceptible Biology (Subtle):** Your heartbeat and breathing are unusually faint, making you slightly harder to detect by non-magical means relying on these functions. You gain a +1 bonus on Dexterity (Stealth) checks specifically to avoid detection by sound or breath.
