# Get the Eye of Zaltec

The characters also need to come up with a plan to steal the Eye of Zaltec. Though they don't know the specifics, the informant may have told them that the gem is held in the auction room, locked with a combination lock that only Lady Vocasca knows the passcode for, and attended by guards.

## Montage!

Once 35 minutes are up, the characters have 10 minutes to summarize the actions they took as a montage. Award inspiration for excellent descriptions.

## Time Remaining

If the characters finish their early, note how much time is left in this part of the adventure for scoring, and then move on. If the characters aren't done after 45 minutes in this part of the adventure, inform them they'll have to improvise, because it's time to get this party started!

## Scoring Part 6

Use the scoring sheet from Appendix B to tally the players' points. Scoring for Part 6 is calculated as follows:

Preparation Actions. Assign 50 points the players succeed on a preparation action.

Total Points: $\qquad$ $(0-300)$

Time Remaining. Assign 20 points for every minute remaining in this part when the players finish (maximum 15 mins).

Total Points: $\qquad$ $(0-300)$

TOTAL POINTS PART 6: $\qquad$ (600 max)

---

## Part 7. The Cynosure Ball

Time Limit: 2 hours.
The characters infiltrate Vocasca Manor to steal the Eye of Zaltec. Rival criminal factions are onsite with the same goal.

Fireworks crackle through the night, illuminating the face of Vocasca Manor with strobing pink and white lights. Tonight, the whole of Waterdeep seems to be on edge, as though the gods themselves were watching.

You now have 2 hours real-time to break into Vocasca Manor, infiltrate the private auction, and steal the Eye of Zaltec. Don't worry about lifting any other valuables - in this final part, it's all about the Eye of Zaltec. Good luck!

## ADAPTING TO THE GROUP'S PLAN

It's your job to bring the group's plan to dramatic conclusion. This requires you to think on your feet. Don't be a slave to the adventure text and be prepared to adlib events where necessary.

## AsSault

Assault is the players' least likely strategy, but it's a fallback if other plans go awry. With so many Masked Lords present, the hostess trusts in her security team to deal with problems before calling in the City Watch. If an alarm is raised, her guards rush to the area and then surreptitiously patrol the site for the remainder of the event. Any captives are locked up in the cellars (area 6) for questioning after the auction.

## DECEPTION

Characters with fake invitations can enter as nobles. All guests are masked and dressed in expensive finery: if a character appears uncouth or ill-attired, they'll accrue suspicion (see "Suspicion"). Other means of deception include posing as guild inspectors, catering suppliers, servants, or entertainers. Majordomo Grigrof Mug (area 3) keeps an accurate record of his contractors, but players with a convincing story should be able to fast-talk their way past security with a DC 12 Charisma (Deception) check. The guards all wear red tabards emblazoned with the Vocasca coat of arms: if a character has one of these they could pose as a guard (other guards have a $35 \%$ chance of getting suspicious when seeing them up close as described in "Suspicion").

## Stealth

There are many ways to sneak inside: entering through the attic skylight, scaling a drainpipe, or even smuggling people in with a delivery. Getting inside is the easy bit though: stealing the Eye of Zaltec without a cover story or disguise is almost impossible. Thankfully, there are plenty of opportunities to acquire disguises once inside.

## Diversion

Releasing smoke bombs into the crowds or starting fires are both good plans. Guests panic, and guards rush blindly to investigate. Triggering an evacuation is almost impossible though: Lady Vocasca has waited all year to host this event and won't allow her security team to evacuate the premises unless the building is literally collapsing around them.

## Rival Factions

Each of the criminal factions already has agent on site. These rivals are perfect for adding complications. For example, if your players bypass Lady Vocasca by disguising themselves as waiters, you could have the Bregan D'aerthe agent poison one of the drinks they're carrying to take out a rival noble.

Bregan D'aerthe. The Bregan D'aerthe drow gunslinger named Ulzo'no Braxt'l wears a hat of disguise to appear as the Amnian Prince Kiro Coldtide. He's currently in the ballroom.

Xanathar Guild. The Xanathar Guild agent is an orog onsite in the kitchens, posing as a cook called Masol Ketsk.

Cassalanters. The Cassalanter cult fanatic is posing as a guard called Kalreve Nobleglide. She's currently patrolling Vocasca's Quarters.

Zhentarim. The Zhentarim bandit captain is present as the human noble Lady Livi Mosse, a legitimate dignitary of Waterdeep. She's currently in the garden, on the patio just outside the ballroom.

If the players agreed to sell the Eye of Zaltec to their informant's boss, that faction's agent tries to contact the characters during the evening. See the room descriptions for more information.

If the players refused to sell the Eye of Zaltec to their informant, he or she has betrayed them to the rival agents. The rival factions are on the lookout for them, but don't want to blow their own cover by attacking them unless necessary. See the room descriptions for more information.

## SusPiciON

As the characters move through the site, they run the risk of drawing suspicion. To avoid a single

---

failed ability check blowing their cover, use the following rules within the mansion.

- Whenever a character fails an important check or performs an action that seems suspicious, ask the player to roll a d100 and add the result to the group's ongoing suspicion score. This score starts at zero.
- If the group's current suspicion score exceeds the suspicion threshold of 500, any failed checks from this point result in alarms being raised in the character's locations: Shout for a Constable!
- If the group's current suspicion score is less than the suspicion threshold, the NPC in question brushes the suspicious action off as a false alarm. For example, a guard on patrol shrugs and blames the odd noise on rats, or a NPC accepts a hokey cover story.
- If a character performs an action that cleverly allays suspicion, ask them to roll a d100 and remove the result from the group ongoing suspicion score.


## Vocasca Manor layout

The Vocasca Manor map shows the layout of the building. The characters also have Handout 8, an incomplete map that paints the layout in broad strokes. The areas detailed below correspond to locations shown on your map.

## Features of Vocasca Manor

Lady Vocasca's home is a stately manor in the Castle Ward. Walls are crafted from worked stone clad in lacquered wood, with polished floorboards throughout. Hundreds of guests are present.

Dimensions. Each square on the map represents 10 feet. Ceilings are 25 feet high in corridors and rooms.

Doors. Doors are made from paneled wood and are locked where shown on the map. The security guards carry house keys, as does the majordomo, Grigrof Mug (area 3). Picking a lock requires success on a DC 12 Dexterity check made with thieves' tools.

Lighting. For the Cynosure Ball, Lady Vocasca has fitted her lanterns with rosy pink glass. This dims their radiance and creates areas of shadowy light where shown on the map. In these areas, Dexterity (Stealth) checks are made with advantage against creatures without darkvision.

Sounds and Smells. Music and conversation drifts from the ballroom and reception hall. Within those areas, it's almost deafening.

## Area 1: Main Entrance

The street outside Vocasca Manor heaves with revelers. A line of finely dressed, masked nobles winds up the steps to the front door, where armed guards are checking invitations. Stone walls enclose a garden to the rear of the building.

Ten guards man the main entrance, supervised by the sneering guard veteran Guidos Seabone. Guests are refused entry if they can't present an invitation. Most guests are dropped off by carriage outside the entrance, but some arrive on foot and could potentially be waylaid on approach. Guests on foot arrive in groups of 1 d 4 nobles and are always accompanied by a veteran bodyguard. Any character who attempts to pickpocket a noble for their ticket must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check.

## Area 2: Walled Garden

Muffled music drifts over this walled garden. It's dark down here, but exploding fireworks occasionally throw the lawns into sudden, stark detail. A pair of guards stroll around on patrol, carrying a single lantern between them. At the base of the auction house, curved steps ascend to the ballroom doors. A plain door near the base of the steps enters the servant's quarters.

Two guards patrol the garden, with a guard veteran standing watch on the street outside the rear gate. The walls surrounding the garden are 10 feet high. Servants occasionally pass through the garden, ferrying deliveries from the rear gate to the servant's quarters (area 5).

The garden has plenty of hiding places, meaning checks made to hide here have advantage unless the intruder is illuminated by a flash of fireworks. Whenever a character needs to make a Dexterity (Stealth) check, ask them to roll a die beforehand: on an odd result, the fireworks flash just as they move.

Ballroom doors. The doors into the ballroom are open, and guests are milling about on the patio. Anyone not dressed in noble finery or as a waiter arouses suspicion if seen here. The Zhentarim agent Lady Livi Mosse (a bandit captain) is out here with her servants, Brazov and Gladon (spies), spying on Lady Vocasca (see the "Zhentarim Agent" sidebar).

Crack in wall. A narrow crack in the wall on the western side of the garden has been crudely

---

repaired with a pair of planks. If a character scouts the alley here, they spot the crack on a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check. Any character can squeeze through the crack.

Drainpipe. A drainpipe at the rear of the mansion ascends to the eaves of the roof. Climbing the drainpipe requires success on a DC 8 Strength (Athletics) check.

## ZHENTARIM AGENT

Lady Livi Mosse (LE female Illuskan human bandit captain) works for Manshoon's Zhentarim. At all times she is tended by two human footmen named Barzov and Gladon (disguised Zhentarim spies). The middle-aged woman is disguised as a noble enjoying a drink, waiting to hear what Lady Vocasca has to say about the Eye of Zaltec. Livi has no sense of humor and wears a cold face at all times. She enjoys the finer things in life and looks down on everyone else as inferior.

If the characters made a deal with Manshoon's Zhentarim in part 5, Livi waits for a private moment and reveals her identity as an agent of Manshoon. She offers to help the characters however she can without blowing her cover. Livi is willing to create distractions and can enlist the help of Barzov and Gladon in that task.

If the characters refused a deal in part 5 with any faction or if they have exceeded the suspicion threshold (see "Suspicion"), she feigns interest in them and has Barzov and Gladon bring them wine laced with poison. A successful Wisdom (Insight) check opposed by Livi's Charisma (Deception) check reveals she is hiding something. Characters that drink the wine must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 hour (likely until the end of the adventure). A character who examines the wine and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence check with alchemist's supplies can tell the wine is poisoned. Alama has advantage on this check. After the characters drink the wine, the Zhentarim shadow them through the party at a distance. A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check notices them following. If the characters wander into a place without guards, the Zhentarim attack and fight until one of them falls or guards arrive.

If Livi, Barzov, and Gladon are still at the party and the alarm goes off, they arrive to help or hinder the characters (see "The Escape").

## Area 3: ReCeption Hall

Dozens of costumed guests mill about this reception hall, laughing, chatting, and nibbling on canapes dished out by waiters dressed as masked angels. A staircase sweeps up to the ballroom. On either side of the stairs, doors marked "Private" open into the wings of the manor. A door to the east looks like it leads into the bathrooms.

Roughly one hundred nobles are gathered here, attended by fifteen commoner waiters. Two guards stand watch outside each private door. On the grand staircase, the house majordomo Grigrof Mug observes the proceedings with a hawkish eye (see "Roleplaying Grigrof Mug," below).

Rumors. Characters who mingle with the guests overhear the following rumors.

- "There's something off about Prince Coldtide. I just saw him dancing in the ballroom. Does anyone actually know him?"
- "Lady Vocasca is famous for not having an original thought in her head. How did she dream this wonderful event up?"


## Roleplaying Grigrof Mug

Grigrof is a wiry man in his late 40s, dressed in a neat brown suit with a powdered wig. He carries a ledger detailing staff rosters, catering contracts, and other employment matters. Grigrof avoids contact with guests except to handle complaints, concerning himself instead with supervising staff. He is allergic to flour, and the slightest whiff of it sends him into fits of sneezing. Use Grigrof to pester characters disguised as servants or outside contractors. Grigrof is a commoner with Wisdom 14 and an Insight bonus of +4 .

## Area 4: PrIVies

This chamber serves as a privy, with separate stalls for toilets. Guests who wish to relieve themselves quickly can do so in one of the screened-off chamber pots.

There are usually between five and ten nobles in the privies.

Privy windows. A few of the stalls have windows in the walls, which are left open during the party. There's a $25 \%$ chance that a stall is occupied if a character climbs through from outside.

## Area 5: Servant's Quarters

The kitchens are steamy, noisy, and chock full of servants. Sweaty cooks toil over the ovens and man the chopping boards, attending to a never-ending parade of waiting staff. Adjoining rooms are home to pantries, a cold-room for meat, and a washroom.

This area is impossible to sneak through, but its general busyness makes deception easy. Checks made to trick or deceive the staff in here are made

---

with advantage (most of them are under pressure to get service out and couldn't care less who walks past). Tonight, there are fifty human commoner staff on duty. Twenty of them operate as waiters. Most of them have been contracted for the night, so they don't know each other well. A Xanathar Guild agent named Masol Ketsk is onsite in the kitchens, posing as a cook (see the "Xanathar Guild Agent" sidebar below).

Waiting staff costumes. The serving staff are dressed as angels, with feathered strap-on wings, silken tunics, and blank full-face masks. Three spare costumes are laid out in the washroom.

## XANATHAR GUILD AGENT

Masol Ketsk is an orog who works for the Xanathar Guild. Currently Masol is disguised as a cook working in the kitchen. The hulking orog is missing a tusk and truly does have a passion for cooking and food. Given the chance, Masol steers any conversation toward the subject. She keeps a large covered pot nearby at all times that hides a swarm of poisonous snakes she trained to attack.

If the characters made a deal with the Xanathar Guild in part 5, Masol waits for a private moment and reveals her identity as an Agent of the Eye. She offers to help the characters however she can without blowing her cover. She is willing to poison food (if the characters have poison) or create a distraction (possibly using her snakes).

If the characters refused a deal in part 5 with any faction or if they have exceeded the suspicion threshold (see "Suspicion"), Masol asks the characters to help her carry her heavy pot to the guard room in area 8 , so the guards can have stew. A successful DC 12 Wisdom (Insight) check reveals Masol is leading the characters into a trap. When they arrive in the guard room, Masol kicks over the pot of snakes, blames it on the characters, and attacks the party, hoping to bring the guards in the room to her side. If the characters argue against her, have them make an opposed Charisma (Persuasion) check against Masol's Charisma (Intimidation) check. The guards side with whoever is successful, siding with Masol on a tie.

If Masol is still at the party and the alarm goes off, she grabs her pot of snakes and arrives to help or hinder the characters (see "The Escape").

## Area 6: Cellars

A lantern on the wall casts flickering light over this cellar. Huge wine casks stand sentinel in the gloom, set back into arched recesses. A large iron cage rests on the floor at the rear of the cellar.

Waiters infrequently visit this area when they need to refill wine kegs for the kitchens. Stef Salindram (area 7) imprisons intruders in the cage
if they're caught onsite. A tipsy guard is stationed here to ensures nobody meddles with the lock. The cage is padlocked but can be picked with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check made with thieves' tools.

Characters who arrested during this part of the adventure in a Shout for the Constable! encounter are held in the cage here instead of being removed from the scene.

## Area 7: Lady Vocasca's Quarters

This wood-paneled corridor connects a set of opulently furnished living chambers. Paintings on the wall depict an ancient line of stern, Waterdhavian nobility. From somewhere nearby, a lone harpist plays a haunting melody.

The music drifting through this area is conjured magically, but players needn't know this!

Guard on patrol. A single guard called Kalreve Nobleglide patrols this area. She is in fact a cult fanatic working for the Cassalanter noble family (see the "Cassalanter Agent" sidebar below).

Secret Information. Characters who search these rooms learn the following piece of information from a letter hidden in desk drawer.

- "Be cautious around Lady Livi Mosse. She's invited to your party, and we believe she's an agent of the Zhentarim."
Wardrobes. Searching the wardrobes uncovers extravagant noble costumes for four characters, including masks and fans. If a character dresses in noble finery, give them one of the paper fans from your DM kit.


## Cassalanter Agent

Kalreve Nobleglide (LE female Illuskan human cult fanatic) is loyal to the Cassalanters and the cult of Asmodeus. The twenty-something woman speaks quickly, laughs at anything, and takes pleasure in cruelty. She wears a magic crystal necklace. If she breaks the necklace as an action, she summons a bearded devil who acts as Kalreve's bound servant. If anyone else breaks the necklace, the bearded devil is still bound to Kalreve and only does her bidding.

If the characters made a deal with the Cassalanters in part 5, Kalreve waits for a private moment and reveals her identity as a friend of the Cassalanters. She offers to help the characters however she can without blowing her cover. She is willing to act as a guard and escort them into restricted areas (though she does not carry a token for the auction room) and to create a distraction.

If the characters refused a deal in part 5 with any faction or if they have exceeded the suspicion threshold (see "Suspicion"), she locks tries to lock the characters in Lady

---

Vocasca's bedroom with her bearded devil, who attacks. If the characters make it out of the room alive, she then shouts for help, and two veterans from area 8 come to her aid. Kalreve tries to slip away and hide in the privies while the guards question the characters.

If Kalreve is still at the party and the alarm goes off, she summons her devil and arrives to help or hinder the characters (see "The Escape").

## Area 8: Guard Room

This wood-paneled room was once a study but has been turned over for use as a guard room. A map of the mansion is pinned to an easel, penned with guard positions and handwritten notations. More parchments are scattered over a heavy wooden desk: guard rosters, guest lists, and inventories.

Two guard veterans are present here, talking through the rosters with the knight in charge of security, Stef Salindram. Stef is entirely blind in his left eye.

Map. If the characters study the map on the easel, fill in Handout 8 with any information shown on the Vocasca Manor map. The guard rosters, guest lists, and inventories contain information on everyone present tonight: if the players use these to aid their plans, grant them advantage on any pertinent checks.

Secret information. Characters who search through the papers learn the following piece of information:

- "We believe one of the cooks, Masol Ketsk, may have links to the Xanathar Guild. His story checks out for now, but let's keep an eye on him."


## Area 9: Ballroom

Thousands of pink and white rose petals drift from the ceiling to rain over the Cynosure Ball. Laugher and music fill the air, wine flows like water, and drunken guests cavort through the masked crowd. To the side of the hall, armored guards flank a set of double doors. Doors at the rear of the ballroom open into the gardens.

Only guests, waiters, and guards are allowed inside the ballroom. In total, four hundred noble guests are present here, watched over by twenty guards.

If a character enters here dressed as a noble, read:

A majestic woman dressed in a flowing pink and white dress swirls from the crowd. She extends her hand toward you and laughs. Judging by the looks you're getting from other guests, she's clearly important.
"Welcome to my party, darlings! Can you guess who I am? No, I simply can't stand it! I'm Lady Vocasca! Come! Let us talk!"

If the character agrees to talk to her, Lady Vocasca proposes a fun game to grant them entry to the private auction (see the "Lady Voscasca's Game").

Note also that Lady Vocasca is the only person here that knows the password for the strongbox containing the Eye of Zaltec. She won't reveal this unless charmed or drugged. The password is "password." Vocasca has a thing for half-elves, so Corvis gains advantage on all Charisma checks made to manipulate her. She has disadvantage on any saving throws to resist charm effects from half-elves.

Dancing guests. Guests cram the ballroom floor, either standing about talking, or swirling past dancing. The entire room counts as difficult terrain, and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight or hearing are made with disadvantage.

Auction room entrance. A hired wizard, Falco Theros, stands sentinel outside the auction room, flanked by two guards. Falco has the statistics of a mage with the following modifications:

- Falco has see invisibility prepared instead of suggestion.
- Falco has already spent one of his $2^{\text {nd }}$ level slots to cast see invisibility. Every hour, he spends another slot to recast the spell.
To enter the auction room, guests must present their rune-marked coin to Falco. If Lady Vocasca has enabled the rune, he allows them entry.


## BRegan D'aerthe Agent

Ulzo'no Braxt'l is a Bregan D'aerthe drow gunslinger masquerading as the human Amnian Prince Kiro Coldtide thanks to his hat of disguise. Ulzo'no is tended to by four masked drow guards, who have every inch of skin covered by elaborate angel costumes.

If the characters made a deal with Bregan D'aerthe in part 5, Ulzo'no waits for a private moment and reveals his identity as an agent of Bregan D'aerthe. He offers to help the characters however he can without blowing his cover. He shares the location and names of the other criminal agents and is willing to create a distraction.

If the characters refused a deal in part 5 with any faction or if they have exceeded the suspicion threshold (see

---

"Suspicion"), he encourages them to dance with him. While the characters dance, Ulzo'no uses a special ring to attempt to poison them. As he passes by a character, he can touch them with his ring by making a melee attack roll with a +6 bonus. If he hits, the character takes 1 piercing damage and must save against the ring's drow poison (see the "Drow Poison" sidebar).

A character that falls asleep due to this poison is considered drunk by the guards and taken to the cage in area 6 to be dealt with after the party ends. The guards poke the character awake once secure in the cage.

If Ulzo'no is still at the party and the alarm goes off, he gathers the other drow and arrives to help or hinder the characters (see "The Escape").

## Drow PoISON

A creature subjected to drow poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour (likely until the end of this adventure). If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is also unconscious while poisoned in this way. The creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake.

## Area 10: Auction Room

This area is off limits to everyone apart from guards and guests who carry the correct token: a gold coin marked with a magic rune. Read the following when the players enter:

This hall is lit by low-burning lanterns and thick with the smell of incense and perfume. A private bar runs the length of the far wall, and a semicircle of chairs is arranged around a large box covered in red drapes sitting in the middle of the floor. Masked guests mill around the room, muttering to each other.

There are three veterans standing guard next to the box. In total, there are thirty noble guests in here. Once inside, guests can mingle freely between their seats and the bar, but the guards shoo them away from the covered box containing the Eye of Zaltec.

Auction. The auction begins at "ten bells." When a character first enters the auction room, tell the players that they have fifteen minutes real-time (or until the end of the event) before the auction ends and their mission fails. During this time, a character can drag out proceedings by getting into a bidding war for the gem. Each success on a DC 12 Charisma (Deception) check buys the group another five minutes, with failures gaining suspicion. If the players fail to steal the Eye of Zaltec within time, the gem is stolen by a rival faction (see the "Grand Melee").

The Eye of Zaltec. See "Stealing the Eye" for details on how players can steal the Eye of Zaltec.

## Area 11: Attic

A moonbeam falls from the skylight into a yawning attic space. Packing crates, shipping chests and old furniture are haphazardly squared away under tarpaulins.

Nobody comes up here. It's silent and safe to explore.

Strongbox receipt. If a character searches the chests, they find a crumpled receipt stuffed in an empty packaging crate. A message is written on the receipt:
"My lady Vocasca, I hope you received this combination safe intact. Do try to think of something original for the password: i.e. not your own name!"

Crates. Searching the crates uncovers extravagant noble costumes for six characters, including masks and fans. If a character dresses in noble finery, give them one of the paper fans from your DM kit.

## LADY Vocasca's GAME

Lady Vocasca offers characters dressed in noble finery an opportunity to win a coin for the private auction. When she pulls one or more of these characters aside, she reveals the following information:

- Lady Vocasca gives one of the characters a special coin for the private auction. Give the player an actual coin. As you pass it over, use your paper fan to hide it from view as best as possible.
- Lady Vocasca says the coin admits up to six guests to the private auction. However, it won't work until she activates the rune. This is true.
- Lady Vocasca says she'll be keeping an eye on the character for the next ten minutes. If they can slip the coin to one of their companions without her noticing, they can keep the coin. If she can tell who's got it, she'll take it back!
Now explain the following out-of-character:
- The players must hide the coin from you, so you can't guess who's got it after ten minutes. Players can use the paper fans to hide the coin from view as they pass it around.

---

- Play continues as normal. The player's goal is to pass the coin among themselves until you can't tell who's got it.
- Players must adhere to the following rules:


## 1. A player can only pass the coin to another player whose character is present.

2. The coin must always be held by a player.
3. The coin must remain above the level of the table.
4. The coin must remain at the table.

After ten minutes, Vocasca seeks out the characters and you must guess who has the coin. If you guess incorrectly, Vocasca activates the rune and the players can use it to enter the auction. If you guess correctly, Vocasca takes the coin back.

## Stealing the Eye

The box containing the Eye of Zaltec is kept on a pedestal under red drapes. It appears as a two-foot-cubic adamantine case with a single, handsized opening in one of its vertical sides. The faces of the box are solid crystal, offering a view of the gem within, Guards watch the box continually, but obviously can't see under the drapes. If a character looks under the drapes, read:

A two-foot-cubic adamantine box rests on the pedestal. The faces of the box are solid crystal, offering a view of the gem within. The Eye of Zaltec is a fist-sized glowing ruby held aloft by an adamantine claw protruding from the box's base. Orbiting the claw's wrist is a letter dial with an eightdigit numbered combination lock set into its center. On the letter dial, each letter of the alphabet corresponds to a number from one to nine. A hand-sized opening is set into the back side of the box, allowing you to reach inside and manipulate the dial.

## Solving the Puzzle Lock

If the players know the correct passcode ("password"), they can read the letter dial to extract the following combination: "71115694". When this code is entered in the combination lock, the claw releases the Eye of Zaltec. When the players have the gem, proceed to "The Escape." Forcing the gem from the claw requires success on a DC 15 Strength check and sets off a shrieking alarm (see "The Escape").

## The Escape

Soon after the characters steal the Eye of Zaltec, all hell breaks loose.

## No Alarm

Soon after they acquire the gem, Lady Vocasca calls the auction to a close and pulls the drapes on the box. Read:

Gasps erupt from the crowd as the drapes are pulled back. The box lies open and the Eye of Zaltec is gone! Lady
Vosasca shrieks.
"Treachery! The Eye of Zaltec has been stolen! Lock the doors! Call the City Watch! We'll not leave this hall until the culprits have been identified!"

Confusion spreads over the auction house as word breaks that the Eye of Zaltec has been stolen. Ask each player to describe how they escape the auction house. Make it clear to the players that this is not combat, so no dice need to be rolled. They can narrate exactly how they escape the manor in the coolest way possible.

## The Alarm

If the alarm on the box is triggered, read:

The box begins shrieking like a banshee, a strangled wail that alerts all the guards in the room. Lady Vocasca squeals in shock.
"Stop! Thieves!"

The players are attacked by any guard veterans still present. Each round thereafter, the following enemies appear and attempt to take the gem from the characters:

- At the start of the second round of combat, Lady Livi Mosse (a bandit captain), Barzov, and Gladon (both spies) appear (see the "Zhentarim Agent" sidebar).
- At the start of the third round of combat, Ulzo'no Braxt'l, the drow gunslinger, and his four drow companions appear (see the "Bregan D'aerthe Agent" sidebar).
- At the start of the fourth round of combat, Masol Ketsk, the orog, appears with her swarm of poisonous snakes (see the "Xanathar Guild Agent" sidebar).
- At the start of the fifth round of combat, Kalreve Nobleglide, the cult fanatic, appears with her bearded devil (see the "Cassalanter Agent" sidebar).

---

- At the start of every round of combat after the fifth, two guards appear.
If the players escape alive with the gem, they've completed the adventure!

Allied agent. If the players agreed to their informant's deal, their allied agent tries to aid their escape (assuming they're still alive). This allied agent appears at the start of the second round of combat instead of whenever they normally would.

## Timeout

If the players run out of time, Lady Vocasca calls the auction to a close and pulls the drapes on the box. Read:

Gasps erupt from the crowd as the drapes are pulled back. The box lies open and the Eye of Zaltec is gone! Lady Vosasca shrieks.
"Treachery! The Eye of Zaltec has been stolen! Lock the doors! Call the City Watch! We'll not leave this hall until the culprits have been identified!"

Alas, enemy agents have stolen the Eye of Zaltec. The players have failed in their mission.
