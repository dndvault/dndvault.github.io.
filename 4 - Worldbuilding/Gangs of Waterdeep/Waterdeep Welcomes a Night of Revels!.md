# Waterdeep Welcomes a Night of Revels!

Lliira's Night is soon upon us! Across the city, preparations are in full swing for a grand night of revels, with dancehalls, inns and taverns expecting sell-out crowds. The grandest party of all is sure to be the Cynosure Ball, hosted by Lady Vocasca at her manor in the Castle Ward, and expected to draw many masked lords. Last year, her ladyship treated her guests to the opening of a pie containing five hundred live canaries. What wonders does she have in mind for this year? With the population of the city expected to swell overnight, the City Watch promise severe punishment for those who dishonor the goddess with crimes of violence.

## Sing a Song of Sixpence!

As Lliira's Night approaches, inns across the city are keen to audition entertainers for the night, with minstrels, jugglers and acrobats in particularly high demand. Even the Sea Ward's exclusive private inns are said to be opening their doors to entertainers in the run up to the festival!

## Street Laborer Strike Continues

City wide protests have begun against the ongoing strike by the Loyal Order of Street Laborers. Members of the Fellowship of Carters and Coachmen have called on the Guild of Stonecutters, Masons, Potters and Tile Makers to break the picket lines and attend to the growing pot-hole problem, which has seen cart wheels wrecked with alarming regularity since the strike began. Among the worse streets affected are Artillery Road in the South Ward, Grandmarket Boulevard in the Castle Ward, and Tin Dragon Alley in the Dock Ward.

## Crackdown on CultisM

The City Watch today announced a crackdown on devil and demon worship within the city. Extra watchmen have been drafted in to conduct raids of condemned houses, sewers, and crypts within the city, which are known to be common hideouts for such accursed folk. Of course, Waterdeep's gangs have been known to masquerade as City Watch, so this newspaper warns residents to always check for official identification before opening one's door to the law.

## Hang-Gliders Stolen by ZHENTS!

Three flying machines brought to Waterdeep by the famed inventor Khaled bin Zafir have been stolen in a brazen highway robbery in the South Ward. The culprits behind the theft are thought to be the Zhentarim, whose ongoing street war with thugs of the Xanathar Guild has caused chaos across the city this summer. Authorities are worried that the thugs could be planning to use the gliders to infiltrate noble residences from the rooftops.
