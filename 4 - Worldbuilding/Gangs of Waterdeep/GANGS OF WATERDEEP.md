## Introduction

Gangs of Waterdeep is a Dungeons \& Dragons® adventure for the six 3rd-level pregenerated characters included with the adventure. Using characters other than those provided is not allowed, as the characters are created to fit specifically into the story and encounters of the adventure.

The D\&D Open is a competitive event designed for multiple groups playing together. Players participating in the event can earn rewards that can be applied to one D\&D Adventurers League character. Rewards can only be applied to a single DDAL character, as described on the official D\&D Open reward certificate provided to players at the end of the event (see 'Rewards').

The event runs for approximately 8 hours, with a break between the first and second round.

## COMPETITION vs Fun

In the past, the D\&D Open was a highly competitive event where the players vied to "win" by earning the most points within a highly structured scoring system. This new incarnation of the D\&D Open is a departure from those early iterations. While competitive aspects of the event remain intact, the event's main goal has changed: FUN FOR EVERYONE!

This D\&D Open maintains a scoring system, although the scoring isn't as rigid as D\&D Open events of the past, and prizes can be earned in many ways. Not only will prizes be given to the groups that get the most points, but additional prizes are possible for roleplaying, problem solving, or just being in the right place at the right time.

This D\&D Open also adds some theatrical elements that allow the players, DMs, and other volunteers to roleplay at different tables.

## OPEN HQ

The event administrators are located at a special table, referred to as Open HQ, with staff also wandering the floor. If you or your players have any questions, flag one of the Open HQ staff or send the table captain to Open HQ on behalf of the table.

## Background and Overview

In the city of Waterdeep, hostilities between several criminal organizations have spilled over into the streets. Each faction vies for information
on the whereabouts of a fortune in stolen gold coins, rumored to be held in the legendary Vault of Dragons.

One potential lead involves a gem called the Eye of Zaltec, recently brought to Waterdeep from Chult by Harriot Redwind, a halfling explorer. The gem once belonged to an aboleth called Golorr, and scholars believe it can lead to the Stone of Golorr, which in turn is the key to finding the Vault of Dragons.

Through a series of encounters, the characters learn about the criminal gangs searching for the Eye of Zaltec, and through their own investigations, learn the whereabouts and the properties of the magical gem. The story concludes as the adventurers attempt to take possession of the gem at a gala costume ball.

## Player Characters

- Alama Curondo - Turmani Human Mastermind (Zhentarim). Alama Curondo grew up in the streets of Waterdeep with his twin brother Calar, where they learned the art of disguising themselves to get coin and survive. Both joined the Zhentarim as soon as they were able. When the Zhentarim helped foil the rise of Tiamat, Alama saw many of his fellow Zhents get injured and resolved to learn the healing arts, a decision that eventually saved his brother's life. With the schism in the organization, Alama finds himself on a side opposite Calar, who is loyal to Manshoon. Alama has recently found a loyal friend in Zashyda Adier.
- Caldra Finelock - Illuskan Human Arcane Trickster (Force Grey). Caldra Finelock was born and raised in Waterdeep. From the time she was an adult, Caldra made it a point to break into the offices of corrupt nobles and City Watch officers to expose them as criminals. As her fame grew around the city, she was asked to join Force Grey, an offer she accepted as it also came with free tutelage in the arcane arts. Caldra's wife, Tessa, runs a tavern in the North Ward called Tessa's Table. Caldra's newest target to investigate is the Cassalanter noble family, who sullied the name of Tessa's Table because "the food and ale look terrible and tasted worse." She is fond of Corvis Delco'sicet, who rents a room from her and has a similar distaste for the city's corrupt nobles.
- Corvis Delco'sicet - Half-elf Swashbuckler (Order of the Gauntlet). Corvis Delco'sicet's

---

drow father abandoned his family in Menzoberranzan to marry his true love, Corvis' mother, a young Waterdhavian noble. Her family disowned her, and her husband disappeared under suspicious circumstances. Corvis was taught the way of Ilmater by his mother, as they endured hardship after hardship in the slums of Waterdeep. Corvis now cares for her by stealing from other thieves in the city. His greatest wish is to find out more about his father. Corvis rents a room in Tessa's Table and has bonded with Caldra Finelock over their distaste for the city's nobles.

- Long Mei - Shou Human College of Swords Bard (Harper). Long Mei is a former professional fighter who lost his hands to members of the Xanathar Guild after refusing to throw a fight. Though he had both hands replaced with clockwork prostheses, he was blackballed from the fighting circuits. He turned to a life of thievery to support his sick little sister, Jia, and only steals from "those who deserve it." He is Erianna "Mischief" Nartha's best friend.
- Erianna "Mischief" Nartha - Tiefling Assassin (Lord's Alliance). Mischief is a tiefling assassin who rigs her tail with many hidden devices (poison needles, lockpicks, etc.). As a child, she was orphaned and raised by the Nartha noble family, secret cultists of Asmodeus who committed terrible acts of sacrifice led by her adopted mother, Dreena. Mischief looks for redemption by stealing from corrupt nobles and giving most of her share to the downtrodden of Waterdeep. She is Long Mei's best friend.
- Zashyda Adier - Calishite Human Thief (Zhentarim). Zashyda's mother and father met in the Zhentarim and worked for the organization their entire lives. She has the same dedication to the band of mercenaries, believing the schism in the Zhentarim is one that must be healed by removing Manshoon from power. For years she worked as a spy, reporting on the Xanathar Guild until she was caught. Agents of the Eye burnt out one of her eyes as punishment. If there's one person Zashyda can count on, it's her friend Alama Curondo.


## RounDS

The event is divided into two rounds. Each round is timed and lasts approximately four hours.

## Round One

The first round begins by introducing the characters, and then plays out their investigations into the location of the Eye of Zaltec.

Part 1. The players are mustered to their tables, have the chance to get acquainted with their characters and each other, roleplay their initial meeting with Volo, and learn the first clue on the trail of the Eye of Zaltec.

Part 2. The characters infiltrate the Mermaid's Gem Inn, looking for the notes of a halfling explorer named Harriot Redwind.

Part 3. The characters descend on an old manor house where the Cassalanter noble family performs rituals to assist them in the hunt for the Eye of Zaltec.

Part 4. The characters hijack a coach to question Thardouk Starbuckler, another noble thought to know the whereabouts of the Eye of Zaltec. They discover that the gem is due to be auctioned at the Cynosure Ball, on Lliira's Night, in Summertide.

At the end of Round One, the characters should have acquired the name and description of an individual who can help them get inside the auction house. When they return at the start of Round Two, they must search the DMs at the event to find their contact.

## Round Two

Round Two starts as the characters (and players literally) search for their contact and culminates in an audacious heist to steal the Eye of Zaltec.

Part 5. After finding their contact, the characters question them about how to get inside the auction house. The informant gives the players an incomplete map of the premises and promises to aid them in the heist if they agree to sell the gem to the contact's master.

Part 6. The characters plan their daring theft of the Eye of Zaltec, including purchasing gear and laying any groundwork necessary.

Part 7. The night of the Cynosure Ball! The party finds their way inside, infiltrates the ball, and steals the gem. If they succeed, they must decide whether to give the gem to Volo as promised, keep it for themselves, or hand it over to one of the factions.

Part 8. Scores for each table are tallied, and winners are announced. Rewards for individual and group efforts are presented.

## Preparing for the Game

There are some preparations that you need to make before beginning the game.

## PREPARE Your Criminal Informant

Each DM must prepare a unique NPC for the event. Refer to part 5 for instructions on how to create this character. DMs are encouraged to dress up as their informant, with a prize awarded at the end of the event for the best-dressed DM!

## Collect Your DM Pack

When you arrive at the event, visit Open HQ to collect your DM Pack and drop off your criminal informant summary (see part 5). Make sure you collect a criminal informant summary from Open HQ when you drop yours off.

Your DM pack contains certificates for the adventure, and seven specially-designed paper fans - one for yourself, and one for each of the players. These fans come into play in part 7.

## Playing the Game

It's your responsibility to adjudicate the rules of the game fairly and ensure your players have a fun time.

## AdJusting the Encounters

Because of the competitive nature of the event, DMs are not permitted to adjust to the difficulty of the adventure. While any game of D\&D requires the DM to be flexible in responding to the variety of ideas players can employ, the D\&D Open should see DMs staying close to the script to ensure all tables have a consistent, even if not identical, play experience.

Since this adventure uses pre-generated characters, there is no need to scale encounters up or down based on the strength of the party. All tables playing the adventure should also have exactly six players, one for each character, so no adjustments are required based on the number of players.

## Timekeeping

The adventure operates under strict time limits. Boxed text at the start of each part states how much real time is available to complete the objectives. If the players fail to finish in time, their characters must retreat and cut their losses.

In the unlikely event the players finish their objectives ahead of time, each part includes a complication that you can spring on them to introduce new challenges and scoring opportunities. Players are not expected to encounter these complications unless they've made some masterstroke to complete their objectives early.

You can keep the pace throughout by reminding players they're working against the clock, forcing them to vote if they reach an impasse, and keeping the game moving wherever possible.

If the players run out of time in a part of the adventure without gaining the information they need to move to the next, Volo provides them the information necessary to move on with the adventure.

## A Note on Combat

The pre-generated characters operate under the maxim that violence is only used as a last resort. If combat does ensue, try to resolve it as quickly as possible. The following methods speed up play:

- Use theater of the mind combat, or handwave distances on the battlemap instead of counting feet.
- Don't roll for enemy initiative. All enemies act on an initiative count of $10+$ the Dexterity modifier of the enemy with the highest Dexterity.
- If any player beats the enemy on initiative, the group acts first. Just start with the player with the highest initiative result, and then circle around the table clockwise from that player.
- Use average damage for enemy attacks.


## Splitting the Party

Most of the scenarios in Gangs of Waterdeep play out as planned robberies. As a group of welltrained grifters, the characters are likely to split up to make best use of their abilities; when they do, cut between them often to minimize boredom for other players. Think of it like a heist movie. Try to cut to a new scene when:

- Somebody makes a mistake.
- Somebody uncovers important information.
- Somebody wonders what's happening to somebody else.
Alternatively, roll initiative when the group splits up and use it to cut between players. This gives everyone a fair chance to participate.

---

## RESTS

Each part is a time-pressure operation, so players can't take short or long rests during play. At the end of each part, the group can take a long rest without penalty.

## Character Death

When a character dies, that player must sit out until the start of the next part of the adventure. At that time, the character is considered to have been brought back to life by their faction. The characters suffer no penalties from being raised from the dead.

## MAPS

Maps of each location are provided for you. You may use theater of the mind or battlemaps or a combination of both. Whatever fits your DM style is fine. During heist missions, players may find it useful to place figures on a rough map of the location to manage their plans.

Be aware that combat is used a last resort in this adventure. Using a battlemap to measure precise distances can slow down the action and affect a group's chances of winning. Please ask the players what their preference is, or run theater of the mind as a default.

## Scoring

This is a scored event. Points are awarded for completing core goals -- completing encounters, finishing quests, and collecting treasures -- with bonus points for different accomplishments, quirky achievements, and even amusing failures. A place for scoring each encounter is included in the adventure text, and a separate scoring sheet for each round is provided as Appendix B: Scoring.

Please do not give players any information about points values for scoring before, during, or after the adventure, unless instructed to do so. This event runs at other shows, so revealing the scoring would be unfair for those who play elsewhere.

If you have any questions about scoring, ask Open HQ for help. While scoring should be done as accurately as possible, it is more important to run a fun event for the table than it is to get every point tallied exactly right. That said, do your best to keep track, as this will likely be an important part of the fun for some players. Provide Open HQ with your table's completed scoring sheet at the end of both rounds of play.

## ReWARDS

Don't remind your players to search for treasure! If they miss items that could aid them later in the adventure, that is a natural consequence of poor decision making. If they miss vital leads, Volo always steps in to aid them at the end of their current part (see the adventure text for further information).

## DM ReWARDS

Be sure that you receive your official D\&D Open DM reward certificate for volunteering your time in providing a great play experience. Thank you for your efforts!

## Player ReWARDS

Player rewards are giving at the end of the adventure. These rewards are provided as official DDAL certificates.

The scoring sheet provides a column indicating which accomplishments earn a certificate. Please make sure you request, collect, and distribute the certificates earned by the party.

## EXPERIENCE

You do not need to calculate the experience of the event. As detailed on their certificates, all players receive experience that they can apply to one Adventurers League character.

## Treasure

You do not need to calculate the treasure for the event. As detailed on their certificates, all players receive treasure that they can apply to one Adventurers League character.

## SHOUT FOR THE CONSTABLE!

The City Watch of Waterdeep takes allegations of criminal activity seriously. If the characters are seen breaking the law in any part of this adventure, you should wave your arms, stand up if you can, and shout, "Constable!" Part 4 has special rules about when you can shout for the constable (see "City Watch" in part 4).

---

## The Constables

There should be at least one person who serves as a roaming constable per ten tables at your event. It is recommended they are given plastic police badges or something else that makes constables easily identifiable.

## If Mo Constable Approaches

If you call out for a City Watch constable because the characters broke the law and all the constables are engaged with other tables, then the characters get away with the illegal deed, since there are no law officers around. If a constable is free, they approach your table and momentarily take control of the game.

## If a Constable Approaches

When the City Watch constable approaches your table, give them a full account of what crime was committed and which characters were involved. Then allow the constable to go to work.

## For the Constable

If you are the constable, once you hear a description of the crime, turn to the characters involved. Tell them the penalty they must pay for the law they broke (see "Pay the Price"). Then tell them they have one chance to get out of it:

- A character who tries to slip away must make a DC 15 Dexterity (Stealth) check. If the character succeeds, that character gets away with the crime. If the character fails, add a 50 gp fine to that character's sentence for attempting to hide from the law.
- A character who tries to run away must make a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. If the character succeeds, that character gets away with the crime. If the character fails, add a 50 gp fine to that character's sentence for attempting to run from the law.
- A character who tries to lie their way into appearing innocent must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma (Deception) check. If the character succeeds, that character gets away with the crime. If that character fails, the character must face the consequences of their actions.
- A character can bribe the constable by paying them 100 gp to look the other way. A successful DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check reduces bribe to 50 gp . This bribe convinces the constable to charge no other characters involved for the crime as well. If the characters
can't pay the bribe for whatever reason, add a 50 gp fine to the character's sentence for attempted bribery.
- A character can try to attack the constable by making three attack rolls against AC 17 with a weapon or spell that requires an attack roll. If all three attack rolls succeed, the constable flees and every character involved in the crime gets away with it. If one or more attacks fail, the constable beats up the character, who suffers one level of exhaustion and has a 100 gp fine added to their sentence for resisting arrest.
- Characters who make clever use of a spell, such as invisibility, or a skill (and succeed on a DC 15 ability check) can be rewarded (or punished on a failure) as you see fit.


## Pay the Price

Use the Sentencing table to determine the penalties the characters must pay if they are caught committing crimes.

## Sentencing

| Crime | Sentence |
| :-- | :-- |
| Assault | 100 gp fine per victim |
| Burglary | Imprisonment and the <br> stolen items must be <br> returned |
| Disturbing the peace | 25 gp fine per character <br> involved |
| Murder | Imprisonment |
| Property damage | 50 gp fine per character |
| Robbery | 100 gp fine per character <br> involved and the stolen <br> items must be returned |
| Using magic to <br> influence (no consent) | 100 gp fine per victim |

Any fines must be paid to the constable immediately. Write down any fines on the group's scoring sheet and penalize their score by that amount. If the fines cannot be paid, the constable arrests and imprisons the character.

Imprisoned characters are removed from the scene and do not return to the adventure until you reach the next part (after their faction has bailed them out of jail). Each character imprisoned penalizes the players' score by 200 points. Characters imprisoned during part 7 of the adventure do not exit the scene and instead are held in a cage in the cellars (area 6 in part 7).

---

## Part 1. Let's Get Started

Time Limit: 1 hour
The players are seated, the characters distributed and reviewed, and the story of their exploits in search of the Eye of Zaltec begins.

## DMS IN MUSTERING

After a brief DM meeting, DMs are sent to their table with the materials the players need: six character packets and two handouts. Handout 1 is called "Honor Among Thieves" and discusses some helpful instructions about the D\&D Open. Handout 2 is a broadsheet called "The Waterdeep Wazoo," containing some news (and clues) about the background events of this adventure.

Only share with the players the material they're allowed to see (at this stage, just the handouts and the character packets).

## At the Table

As players arrive at your table, point them to the character packets. Only allow them to see the cover page of the packets, not letting them flip to the character information on the inside. When six players are at your table, have them choose a character to play. Encourage them to pick quickly so that when the event starts, they are ready.

- When characters are selected, allow the players to open the packets and get familiar with their characters. Instruct them not to reveal any of the secret information in the packet. Answer any questions they might have.
- Also draw attention to Handouts 1 and 2, which contain helpful information about scoring and the flow of play during the Open.
- Ask the table to pick one person as the table captain. This person makes decisions for the table if a vote does not settle matters, keeps track of paperwork, interacts with Open HQ when necessary, etc. Make sure the table captain has all necessary paperwork and knows the location of Open HQ at the event. If the table cannot pick a captain, it is up to you who gets the job.


## Revealing the Eye of Zaltec

Approximately 20 minutes after the event begins (2:20 pm at Origins 2018), costumed individuals carry the Eye of Zaltec into the room in a curtained box to much fanfare. The box is placed center
stage, and the curtains are drawn to hide the gem from the crowd.

The lead administrator addresses the room, giving a history of the gem and announcing how it will be auctioned off at the end of the ball:
"Welcome, Lords of Waterdeep, to the Cynosure Ball! Tonight, at the height of Summertide, we offer praise to Lliira, Mistress of Revels!
"A select few among you have been chosen for a great honor. After the dance, you'll have an opportunity to bid for the Eye of Zaltec: a magical jewel plucked from the steaming heart of the jungles of Chult! For centuries, this gem has rested in the Tomb of the Nine Gods beneath the lost city of Omu, until brave adventurers prized it from its sanctuary. Before then, it surmounted the Great Pyramid in Nexal, capital of the Maztican Empire.
"The gem is said to be priceless - but I know money is no object to the nobles in this room! Before the auction begins, let us behold the gem in all its glory!"

Then the curtains are pulled back on the box, revealing that the gem has been stolen!
"Treachery! The Eye of Zaltec has been stolen! Lock the doors! Call the City Watch! We'll not leave this hall until the culprits have been identified!"

At this point, you may begin.

## Starting the Open

After the gem has been revealed as missing, read:

So, did your group steal the Eye of Zaltec? If so, I'll bet you're wondering how you did it. Let's find out!

Several weeks ago, as you went about your business, you were passing through an open-air market in Waterdeep's South Ward in the morning. Local celebrity Volothamp Geddarm was collecting a package from a stall, when six shady characters in hooded cloaks pulled out crossbows and leveled them at Volo. Each of you took out or distracted one of these assassins. How did you save Volo?

Make it clear to the players that this is not combat, so no dice need to be rolled. They can narrate exactly what they did to stop these assassins from murdering Volo in cold blood.

---

Go around the table and have each player give a description of how they dealt with their individual attacker. No rolls are necessary: whatever they say happened, happened (within reason).

Award points to each player based on the ingenuity of their answer and their flair for roleplaying (see 'Scoring Part 1').

After completing this section, Volo finds each of the characters and asks them to meet him at the Yawning Portal later that afternoon, so he can thank them properly.

## At the Yawning Portal

When the characters arrive later that day at the Yawning Portal Inn and Tavern, Volo brings them to a private table and says the following:

[^0]Characters succeeding on a DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check realize Volo is offering them an insultingly low retainer on the expectation they'll haggle. Doing so earns them points.

## Bartering with Volo

Let the players roleplay the bartering if they choose, or just make a Charisma (Persuasion) check. If they roleplay well, the Persuasion check is made with advantage. When scoring, award up to 5 extra points if the players deliver an entertaining performance.

Only one character can try the check, although any other characters who spoke up can use the Help action to assist on the primary roll.

Give disadvantage if the characters try to influence Volo with magic or strong-arm tactics. Volo is wise to pickpockets and carries no money on his person (and sends the retainer via courier later the same day). Consult the chart below for results:

## Bartering with Volo

|  Check Result | Retainer | Points  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  $0-5$ | 20 gp | 20  |
|  $6-9$ | 40 gp | 40  |
|  $10-14$ | 60 gp | 60  |
|  $15-19$ | 80 gp | 80  |
|  $20+$ | 100 gp | 100  |

## Questioning Volo

Once the players have agreed on a retainer, read:

And with that, you accepted Volo's quest. But you weren't done with him yet: you knew that the best tool for any job was information. What did you ask Volo to prepare yourselves for the coming mission?

Give 30 additional points for each of the questions below that the characters ask (maximum 150 points).

## What is a "private" inn?

"A private inn means you can't enter unless you work there, or you're taking a room. Rooms at the Mermaid's Gem are very expensive. I'll not be staying there any time soon."

## What's the security like at the Mermaid's Gem?

"I've not been inside. Most of these places have private security and give small gifts to the City Watch to ensure they've never too far away."
