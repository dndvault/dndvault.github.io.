You each can take one preparation action.
Refer to this sheet if you use your action to buy or craft equipment,

## Buying EQUIPMENT

A character that takes this action can buy any equipment listed in chapter 5 of the Player's Handbook. In addition, the following special gear is available:

- Grappling Hook Gun. This modified heavy crossbow shoots a grappling hook and 50 feet of rope up to 50 feet. As a ranged attack action you can shoot the grapnel and rope and then (assuming you hit) press another button to reel in an unattended object you hit with it. Reloading the crossbow with a new rope and grapnel requires an action. The crossbow fires bolts normally. Each grappling hook gun costs 150 gp and comes with three shots.
- Smoke Bomb. You can use a smoke bomb as part of the Hide action. You light the bomb, throw it to the ground at your feet, and it explodes in a flash, releasing a 10 -foot cube of colored smoke, which allows you to hide from creatures that could see you clearly before you used the smoke bomb. The smoke from the bomb lasts until the end of your next turn. Each smoke bomb costs 100 gp .
- Tanglefoot Bag. This bag is filled with a sticky adhesive. As an action, you can throw the bag up to 20 feet at a Large or smaller creature, where the bag breaks upon impact. Make a ranged attack roll against the creature. On a hit, the creature is restrained by the glue. A creature restrained this way can break free with a successful DC 10 Strength check made as an action. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the glue also frees the creature without harming it. A tanglefoot bag costs 50 gp .


## Crafting Equipment

The characters have slightly longer than usual to prepare for the job, so they can spend some time crafting specialist equipment. With a preparation action, a character can engage in one of the following crafts:

- Common or Uncommon Potion. Alama and Corvis can use their alchemist's supplies and herbalism kit to attempt to craft any common or uncommon rarity potion listed below under "Potions". Every attempt to create a potion costs 25 gp in supplies for a common potion and 50
gp for an uncommon one. A successful DC 13 Intelligence check with alchemist's supplies or an herbalism kit turns the supplies into the desired potion while a failure simply consumes the supplies. A character can craft as many potions as needed with a single preparation action.
- Disguises. Alama, Corvis, Mischief and Long Mei carry disguise kits and are proficient in their use. To create a disguise, they must spend 10 gp and make a Charisma (Deception) check with advantage. The check result is the DC required to see past the disguise with a Wisdom (Insight) check. Any number of disguises can be made with a single preparation action.
- Identification/Invitations: Alama and Mischief carry forgery kits and are proficient in their use. To forge a document - for example, a false invitation to the party - they must spend 10 gp and make a Dexterity (Deception) check with advantage. The check result is the DC required to see past the forgery with a Wisdom (Insight) check. Any number of documents can be made with a single preparation action.
- Food. Caldra, Long Mei or Zashyda can use their brewer's supplies or cook's utensils to create a food item large enough to conceal a person (such as a large cake or a barrel of beer), 12 light weapons, six weapons that are neither heavy nor light, or three heavy weapons. Such an item requires 100 gp in supplies to make. A character can create as many objects as needed with a single preparation action.
- Modified Clothing. Alama or Zashyda can use their leatherworker's tools or weaver's tools to sew hidden pockets and straps into clothing, which allow a creature to conceal an additional weapon (see "Concealing Weapons"). Modifying an outfit to fit a Light weapon costs 25 gp in supplies. A character can modify as many outfits as needed with a single preparation action.
- Poison. Alama and Mischief can use their alchemist's supplies or a poisoner's kit to attempt to craft the poisons listed below under "Poisons". Every poison has a separate supply cost and creation DC, as shown on the "Crafting Poisons" table. A successful Intelligence check with alchemist's supplies or a poisoner's kit turns the supplies into the desired poison while a failure simply consumes the supplies. A character can craft as many poisons as needed with a single preparation action.

## Poisons

The poisons you can create have the following effects.

## Assassin's Blood

A creature subjected to this poison must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 6 (1d12) poison damage and is poisoned for 24 hours. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and isn't poisoned.

## Carrion Crawler Mucus

A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. The poisoned creature is paralyzed. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

## Serpent Venom

A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Truth Serum

A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 hour. The poisoned creature can't
knowingly speak a lie, as if under the effect of a zone of truth spell.

## Potions

The potions you can create can have the following effects.

## Oil of Slipperiness

## Potion, uncommon

The oil can cover a Medium or smaller creature, along with the equipment it's wearing and carrying (one additional vial is required for each size category above Medium). Applying the oil takes 10 minutes. The affected creature then gains the effect of a freedom of movement spell for 8 hours.

Alternatively, the oil can be poured on the ground as an action, where it covers a 10 -foot square, duplicating the effect of the grease spell in that area for 8 hours.

## Philter of Love

## Potion, uncommon

The next time you see a creature within 10 minutes after drinking this philter, you become charmed by that creature for 1 hour. If the creature is of a species and gender you are normally attracted to, you regard it as your true love while you are charmed. This potion's rosehued, effervescent liquid contains one easy-tomiss bubble shaped like a heart.

## Potion of Climbing

## Potion, common

When you drink this potion, you gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed for 1 hour. During this time, you have advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks you make to climb.

## Potion of Fire Breath

## Potion, uncommon

After you drink this potion, you can use a bonus action to exhale fire at a target within 30 feet of you. The target must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The effect ends after you exhale the fire three times or when 1 hour has passed.

## Potion of Greater Healing

## Potion, uncommon

You regain $4 \mathrm{~d} 4+4$ hit points when you drink this potion.
