## Introduction

Gangs of Waterdeep is a Dungeons \& Dragons® adventure for the six 3rd-level pregenerated characters included with the adventure. Using characters other than those provided is not allowed, as the characters are created to fit specifically into the story and encounters of the adventure.

The D\&D Open is a competitive event designed for multiple groups playing together. Players participating in the event can earn rewards that can be applied to one D\&D Adventurers League character. Rewards can only be applied to a single DDAL character, as described on the official D\&D Open reward certificate provided to players at the end of the event (see 'Rewards').

The event runs for approximately 8 hours, with a break between the first and second round.

## COMPETITION vs Fun

In the past, the D\&D Open was a highly competitive event where the players vied to "win" by earning the most points within a highly structured scoring system. This new incarnation of the D\&D Open is a departure from those early iterations. While competitive aspects of the event remain intact, the event's main goal has changed: FUN FOR EVERYONE!

This D\&D Open maintains a scoring system, although the scoring isn't as rigid as D\&D Open events of the past, and prizes can be earned in many ways. Not only will prizes be given to the groups that get the most points, but additional prizes are possible for roleplaying, problem solving, or just being in the right place at the right time.

This D\&D Open also adds some theatrical elements that allow the players, DMs, and other volunteers to roleplay at different tables.

## OPEN HQ

The event administrators are located at a special table, referred to as Open HQ, with staff also wandering the floor. If you or your players have any questions, flag one of the Open HQ staff or send the table captain to Open HQ on behalf of the table.

## Background and Overview

In the city of Waterdeep, hostilities between several criminal organizations have spilled over into the streets. Each faction vies for information
on the whereabouts of a fortune in stolen gold coins, rumored to be held in the legendary Vault of Dragons.

One potential lead involves a gem called the Eye of Zaltec, recently brought to Waterdeep from Chult by Harriot Redwind, a halfling explorer. The gem once belonged to an aboleth called Golorr, and scholars believe it can lead to the Stone of Golorr, which in turn is the key to finding the Vault of Dragons.

Through a series of encounters, the characters learn about the criminal gangs searching for the Eye of Zaltec, and through their own investigations, learn the whereabouts and the properties of the magical gem. The story concludes as the adventurers attempt to take possession of the gem at a gala costume ball.

## Player Characters

- Alama Curondo - Turmani Human Mastermind (Zhentarim). Alama Curondo grew up in the streets of Waterdeep with his twin brother Calar, where they learned the art of disguising themselves to get coin and survive. Both joined the Zhentarim as soon as they were able. When the Zhentarim helped foil the rise of Tiamat, Alama saw many of his fellow Zhents get injured and resolved to learn the healing arts, a decision that eventually saved his brother's life. With the schism in the organization, Alama finds himself on a side opposite Calar, who is loyal to Manshoon. Alama has recently found a loyal friend in Zashyda Adier.
- Caldra Finelock - Illuskan Human Arcane Trickster (Force Grey). Caldra Finelock was born and raised in Waterdeep. From the time she was an adult, Caldra made it a point to break into the offices of corrupt nobles and City Watch officers to expose them as criminals. As her fame grew around the city, she was asked to join Force Grey, an offer she accepted as it also came with free tutelage in the arcane arts. Caldra's wife, Tessa, runs a tavern in the North Ward called Tessa's Table. Caldra's newest target to investigate is the Cassalanter noble family, who sullied the name of Tessa's Table because "the food and ale look terrible and tasted worse." She is fond of Corvis Delco'sicet, who rents a room from her and has a similar distaste for the city's corrupt nobles.
- Corvis Delco'sicet - Half-elf Swashbuckler (Order of the Gauntlet). Corvis Delco'sicet's

---

drow father abandoned his family in Menzoberranzan to marry his true love, Corvis' mother, a young Waterdhavian noble. Her family disowned her, and her husband disappeared under suspicious circumstances. Corvis was taught the way of Ilmater by his mother, as they endured hardship after hardship in the slums of Waterdeep. Corvis now cares for her by stealing from other thieves in the city. His greatest wish is to find out more about his father. Corvis rents a room in Tessa's Table and has bonded with Caldra Finelock over their distaste for the city's nobles.

- Long Mei - Shou Human College of Swords Bard (Harper). Long Mei is a former professional fighter who lost his hands to members of the Xanathar Guild after refusing to throw a fight. Though he had both hands replaced with clockwork prostheses, he was blackballed from the fighting circuits. He turned to a life of thievery to support his sick little sister, Jia, and only steals from "those who deserve it." He is Erianna "Mischief" Nartha's best friend.
- Erianna "Mischief" Nartha - Tiefling Assassin (Lord's Alliance). Mischief is a tiefling assassin who rigs her tail with many hidden devices (poison needles, lockpicks, etc.). As a child, she was orphaned and raised by the Nartha noble family, secret cultists of Asmodeus who committed terrible acts of sacrifice led by her adopted mother, Dreena. Mischief looks for redemption by stealing from corrupt nobles and giving most of her share to the downtrodden of Waterdeep. She is Long Mei's best friend.
- Zashyda Adier - Calishite Human Thief (Zhentarim). Zashyda's mother and father met in the Zhentarim and worked for the organization their entire lives. She has the same dedication to the band of mercenaries, believing the schism in the Zhentarim is one that must be healed by removing Manshoon from power. For years she worked as a spy, reporting on the Xanathar Guild until she was caught. Agents of the Eye burnt out one of her eyes as punishment. If there's one person Zashyda can count on, it's her friend Alama Curondo.


## RounDS

The event is divided into two rounds. Each round is timed and lasts approximately four hours.

## Round One

The first round begins by introducing the characters, and then plays out their investigations into the location of the Eye of Zaltec.

Part 1. The players are mustered to their tables, have the chance to get acquainted with their characters and each other, roleplay their initial meeting with Volo, and learn the first clue on the trail of the Eye of Zaltec.

Part 2. The characters infiltrate the Mermaid's Gem Inn, looking for the notes of a halfling explorer named Harriot Redwind.

Part 3. The characters descend on an old manor house where the Cassalanter noble family performs rituals to assist them in the hunt for the Eye of Zaltec.

Part 4. The characters hijack a coach to question Thardouk Starbuckler, another noble thought to know the whereabouts of the Eye of Zaltec. They discover that the gem is due to be auctioned at the Cynosure Ball, on Lliira's Night, in Summertide.

At the end of Round One, the characters should have acquired the name and description of an individual who can help them get inside the auction house. When they return at the start of Round Two, they must search the DMs at the event to find their contact.

## Round Two

Round Two starts as the characters (and players literally) search for their contact and culminates in an audacious heist to steal the Eye of Zaltec.

Part 5. After finding their contact, the characters question them about how to get inside the auction house. The informant gives the players an incomplete map of the premises and promises to aid them in the heist if they agree to sell the gem to the contact's master.

Part 6. The characters plan their daring theft of the Eye of Zaltec, including purchasing gear and laying any groundwork necessary.

Part 7. The night of the Cynosure Ball! The party finds their way inside, infiltrates the ball, and steals the gem. If they succeed, they must decide whether to give the gem to Volo as promised, keep it for themselves, or hand it over to one of the factions.

Part 8. Scores for each table are tallied, and winners are announced. Rewards for individual and group efforts are presented.

## Preparing for the Game

There are some preparations that you need to make before beginning the game.

## PREPARE Your Criminal Informant

Each DM must prepare a unique NPC for the event. Refer to part 5 for instructions on how to create this character. DMs are encouraged to dress up as their informant, with a prize awarded at the end of the event for the best-dressed DM!

## Collect Your DM Pack

When you arrive at the event, visit Open HQ to collect your DM Pack and drop off your criminal informant summary (see part 5). Make sure you collect a criminal informant summary from Open HQ when you drop yours off.

Your DM pack contains certificates for the adventure, and seven specially-designed paper fans - one for yourself, and one for each of the players. These fans come into play in part 7.

## Playing the Game

It's your responsibility to adjudicate the rules of the game fairly and ensure your players have a fun time.

## AdJusting the Encounters

Because of the competitive nature of the event, DMs are not permitted to adjust to the difficulty of the adventure. While any game of D\&D requires the DM to be flexible in responding to the variety of ideas players can employ, the D\&D Open should see DMs staying close to the script to ensure all tables have a consistent, even if not identical, play experience.

Since this adventure uses pre-generated characters, there is no need to scale encounters up or down based on the strength of the party. All tables playing the adventure should also have exactly six players, one for each character, so no adjustments are required based on the number of players.

## Timekeeping

The adventure operates under strict time limits. Boxed text at the start of each part states how much real time is available to complete the objectives. If the players fail to finish in time, their characters must retreat and cut their losses.

In the unlikely event the players finish their objectives ahead of time, each part includes a complication that you can spring on them to introduce new challenges and scoring opportunities. Players are not expected to encounter these complications unless they've made some masterstroke to complete their objectives early.

You can keep the pace throughout by reminding players they're working against the clock, forcing them to vote if they reach an impasse, and keeping the game moving wherever possible.

If the players run out of time in a part of the adventure without gaining the information they need to move to the next, Volo provides them the information necessary to move on with the adventure.

## A Note on Combat

The pre-generated characters operate under the maxim that violence is only used as a last resort. If combat does ensue, try to resolve it as quickly as possible. The following methods speed up play:

- Use theater of the mind combat, or handwave distances on the battlemap instead of counting feet.
- Don't roll for enemy initiative. All enemies act on an initiative count of $10+$ the Dexterity modifier of the enemy with the highest Dexterity.
- If any player beats the enemy on initiative, the group acts first. Just start with the player with the highest initiative result, and then circle around the table clockwise from that player.
- Use average damage for enemy attacks.


## Splitting the Party

Most of the scenarios in Gangs of Waterdeep play out as planned robberies. As a group of welltrained grifters, the characters are likely to split up to make best use of their abilities; when they do, cut between them often to minimize boredom for other players. Think of it like a heist movie. Try to cut to a new scene when:

- Somebody makes a mistake.
- Somebody uncovers important information.
- Somebody wonders what's happening to somebody else.
Alternatively, roll initiative when the group splits up and use it to cut between players. This gives everyone a fair chance to participate.

---

## RESTS

Each part is a time-pressure operation, so players can't take short or long rests during play. At the end of each part, the group can take a long rest without penalty.

## Character Death

When a character dies, that player must sit out until the start of the next part of the adventure. At that time, the character is considered to have been brought back to life by their faction. The characters suffer no penalties from being raised from the dead.

## MAPS

Maps of each location are provided for you. You may use theater of the mind or battlemaps or a combination of both. Whatever fits your DM style is fine. During heist missions, players may find it useful to place figures on a rough map of the location to manage their plans.

Be aware that combat is used a last resort in this adventure. Using a battlemap to measure precise distances can slow down the action and affect a group's chances of winning. Please ask the players what their preference is, or run theater of the mind as a default.

## Scoring

This is a scored event. Points are awarded for completing core goals -- completing encounters, finishing quests, and collecting treasures -- with bonus points for different accomplishments, quirky achievements, and even amusing failures. A place for scoring each encounter is included in the adventure text, and a separate scoring sheet for each round is provided as Appendix B: Scoring.

Please do not give players any information about points values for scoring before, during, or after the adventure, unless instructed to do so. This event runs at other shows, so revealing the scoring would be unfair for those who play elsewhere.

If you have any questions about scoring, ask Open HQ for help. While scoring should be done as accurately as possible, it is more important to run a fun event for the table than it is to get every point tallied exactly right. That said, do your best to keep track, as this will likely be an important part of the fun for some players. Provide Open HQ with your table's completed scoring sheet at the end of both rounds of play.

## ReWARDS

Don't remind your players to search for treasure! If they miss items that could aid them later in the adventure, that is a natural consequence of poor decision making. If they miss vital leads, Volo always steps in to aid them at the end of their current part (see the adventure text for further information).

## DM ReWARDS

Be sure that you receive your official D\&D Open DM reward certificate for volunteering your time in providing a great play experience. Thank you for your efforts!

## Player ReWARDS

Player rewards are giving at the end of the adventure. These rewards are provided as official DDAL certificates.

The scoring sheet provides a column indicating which accomplishments earn a certificate. Please make sure you request, collect, and distribute the certificates earned by the party.

## EXPERIENCE

You do not need to calculate the experience of the event. As detailed on their certificates, all players receive experience that they can apply to one Adventurers League character.

## Treasure

You do not need to calculate the treasure for the event. As detailed on their certificates, all players receive treasure that they can apply to one Adventurers League character.

## SHOUT FOR THE CONSTABLE!

The City Watch of Waterdeep takes allegations of criminal activity seriously. If the characters are seen breaking the law in any part of this adventure, you should wave your arms, stand up if you can, and shout, "Constable!" Part 4 has special rules about when you can shout for the constable (see "City Watch" in part 4).

---

## The Constables

There should be at least one person who serves as a roaming constable per ten tables at your event. It is recommended they are given plastic police badges or something else that makes constables easily identifiable.

## If Mo Constable Approaches

If you call out for a City Watch constable because the characters broke the law and all the constables are engaged with other tables, then the characters get away with the illegal deed, since there are no law officers around. If a constable is free, they approach your table and momentarily take control of the game.

## If a Constable Approaches

When the City Watch constable approaches your table, give them a full account of what crime was committed and which characters were involved. Then allow the constable to go to work.

## For the Constable

If you are the constable, once you hear a description of the crime, turn to the characters involved. Tell them the penalty they must pay for the law they broke (see "Pay the Price"). Then tell them they have one chance to get out of it:

- A character who tries to slip away must make a DC 15 Dexterity (Stealth) check. If the character succeeds, that character gets away with the crime. If the character fails, add a 50 gp fine to that character's sentence for attempting to hide from the law.
- A character who tries to run away must make a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. If the character succeeds, that character gets away with the crime. If the character fails, add a 50 gp fine to that character's sentence for attempting to run from the law.
- A character who tries to lie their way into appearing innocent must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma (Deception) check. If the character succeeds, that character gets away with the crime. If that character fails, the character must face the consequences of their actions.
- A character can bribe the constable by paying them 100 gp to look the other way. A successful DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check reduces bribe to 50 gp . This bribe convinces the constable to charge no other characters involved for the crime as well. If the characters
can't pay the bribe for whatever reason, add a 50 gp fine to the character's sentence for attempted bribery.
- A character can try to attack the constable by making three attack rolls against AC 17 with a weapon or spell that requires an attack roll. If all three attack rolls succeed, the constable flees and every character involved in the crime gets away with it. If one or more attacks fail, the constable beats up the character, who suffers one level of exhaustion and has a 100 gp fine added to their sentence for resisting arrest.
- Characters who make clever use of a spell, such as invisibility, or a skill (and succeed on a DC 15 ability check) can be rewarded (or punished on a failure) as you see fit.


## Pay the Price

Use the Sentencing table to determine the penalties the characters must pay if they are caught committing crimes.

## Sentencing

| Crime | Sentence |
| :-- | :-- |
| Assault | 100 gp fine per victim |
| Burglary | Imprisonment and the <br> stolen items must be <br> returned |
| Disturbing the peace | 25 gp fine per character <br> involved |
| Murder | Imprisonment |
| Property damage | 50 gp fine per character |
| Robbery | 100 gp fine per character <br> involved and the stolen <br> items must be returned |
| Using magic to <br> influence (no consent) | 100 gp fine per victim |

Any fines must be paid to the constable immediately. Write down any fines on the group's scoring sheet and penalize their score by that amount. If the fines cannot be paid, the constable arrests and imprisons the character.

Imprisoned characters are removed from the scene and do not return to the adventure until you reach the next part (after their faction has bailed them out of jail). Each character imprisoned penalizes the players' score by 200 points. Characters imprisoned during part 7 of the adventure do not exit the scene and instead are held in a cage in the cellars (area 6 in part 7).

---

## Part 1. Let's Get Started

Time Limit: 1 hour
The players are seated, the characters distributed and reviewed, and the story of their exploits in search of the Eye of Zaltec begins.

## DMS IN MUSTERING

After a brief DM meeting, DMs are sent to their table with the materials the players need: six character packets and two handouts. Handout 1 is called "Honor Among Thieves" and discusses some helpful instructions about the D\&D Open. Handout 2 is a broadsheet called "The Waterdeep Wazoo," containing some news (and clues) about the background events of this adventure.

Only share with the players the material they're allowed to see (at this stage, just the handouts and the character packets).

## At the Table

As players arrive at your table, point them to the character packets. Only allow them to see the cover page of the packets, not letting them flip to the character information on the inside. When six players are at your table, have them choose a character to play. Encourage them to pick quickly so that when the event starts, they are ready.

- When characters are selected, allow the players to open the packets and get familiar with their characters. Instruct them not to reveal any of the secret information in the packet. Answer any questions they might have.
- Also draw attention to Handouts 1 and 2, which contain helpful information about scoring and the flow of play during the Open.
- Ask the table to pick one person as the table captain. This person makes decisions for the table if a vote does not settle matters, keeps track of paperwork, interacts with Open HQ when necessary, etc. Make sure the table captain has all necessary paperwork and knows the location of Open HQ at the event. If the table cannot pick a captain, it is up to you who gets the job.


## Revealing the Eye of Zaltec

Approximately 20 minutes after the event begins (2:20 pm at Origins 2018), costumed individuals carry the Eye of Zaltec into the room in a curtained box to much fanfare. The box is placed center
stage, and the curtains are drawn to hide the gem from the crowd.

The lead administrator addresses the room, giving a history of the gem and announcing how it will be auctioned off at the end of the ball:
"Welcome, Lords of Waterdeep, to the Cynosure Ball! Tonight, at the height of Summertide, we offer praise to Lliira, Mistress of Revels!
"A select few among you have been chosen for a great honor. After the dance, you'll have an opportunity to bid for the Eye of Zaltec: a magical jewel plucked from the steaming heart of the jungles of Chult! For centuries, this gem has rested in the Tomb of the Nine Gods beneath the lost city of Omu, until brave adventurers prized it from its sanctuary. Before then, it surmounted the Great Pyramid in Nexal, capital of the Maztican Empire.
"The gem is said to be priceless - but I know money is no object to the nobles in this room! Before the auction begins, let us behold the gem in all its glory!"

Then the curtains are pulled back on the box, revealing that the gem has been stolen!
"Treachery! The Eye of Zaltec has been stolen! Lock the doors! Call the City Watch! We'll not leave this hall until the culprits have been identified!"

At this point, you may begin.

## Starting the Open

After the gem has been revealed as missing, read:

So, did your group steal the Eye of Zaltec? If so, I'll bet you're wondering how you did it. Let's find out!

Several weeks ago, as you went about your business, you were passing through an open-air market in Waterdeep's South Ward in the morning. Local celebrity Volothamp Geddarm was collecting a package from a stall, when six shady characters in hooded cloaks pulled out crossbows and leveled them at Volo. Each of you took out or distracted one of these assassins. How did you save Volo?

Make it clear to the players that this is not combat, so no dice need to be rolled. They can narrate exactly what they did to stop these assassins from murdering Volo in cold blood.

---

Go around the table and have each player give a description of how they dealt with their individual attacker. No rolls are necessary: whatever they say happened, happened (within reason).

Award points to each player based on the ingenuity of their answer and their flair for roleplaying (see 'Scoring Part 1').

After completing this section, Volo finds each of the characters and asks them to meet him at the Yawning Portal later that afternoon, so he can thank them properly.

## At the Yawning Portal

When the characters arrive later that day at the Yawning Portal Inn and Tavern, Volo brings them to a private table and says the following:

[^0]Characters succeeding on a DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check realize Volo is offering them an insultingly low retainer on the expectation they'll haggle. Doing so earns them points.

## Bartering with Volo

Let the players roleplay the bartering if they choose, or just make a Charisma (Persuasion) check. If they roleplay well, the Persuasion check is made with advantage. When scoring, award up to 5 extra points if the players deliver an entertaining performance.

Only one character can try the check, although any other characters who spoke up can use the Help action to assist on the primary roll.

Give disadvantage if the characters try to influence Volo with magic or strong-arm tactics. Volo is wise to pickpockets and carries no money on his person (and sends the retainer via courier later the same day). Consult the chart below for results:

## Bartering with Volo

|  Check Result | Retainer | Points  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  $0-5$ | 20 gp | 20  |
|  $6-9$ | 40 gp | 40  |
|  $10-14$ | 60 gp | 60  |
|  $15-19$ | 80 gp | 80  |
|  $20+$ | 100 gp | 100  |

## Questioning Volo

Once the players have agreed on a retainer, read:

And with that, you accepted Volo's quest. But you weren't done with him yet: you knew that the best tool for any job was information. What did you ask Volo to prepare yourselves for the coming mission?

Give 30 additional points for each of the questions below that the characters ask (maximum 150 points).

## What is a "private" inn?

"A private inn means you can't enter unless you work there, or you're taking a room. Rooms at the Mermaid's Gem are very expensive. I'll not be staying there any time soon."

## What's the security like at the Mermaid's Gem?

"I've not been inside. Most of these places have private security and give small gifts to the City Watch to ensure they've never too far away."


[^0]:    "Please, enjoy food and drink on me! You have my undying thanks for keeping me safe. This war between the rival gangs in the city is terrible, and the subject of my next small volume: Volo's Guide to Gangs of Waterdeep.
    "It seems my research has already made me some enemies. I believe I was attacked earlier for this." Volo opens the package he collected at the market, revealing a shipping manifesto.
    "This shows that a ship called the Natty Naiad, carrying goods and passengers from Chult, docked here three days ago. One of the items it brought was a valuable ruby called the Eye of Zaltec. Many criminal factions want the gem, but I'm not sure why. Sure, it's valuable, but not more so than other rare gems and items coming from Chult. I believe it might have magical powers. I've heard rumors it might even be relevant in the gang war between the Zhentarim and the Xanathar Guild."

    He pauses for a swig of ale, wiping his mouth with his sleeve. "I desire to know more about this Eye of Zaltec: its provenance, its powers, its current location, and its final destination. I already have a lead for you! The Natty Naiad also carried one Harriot Redwind, an obnoxious halfling scholar specializing in Chultan antiquities. I tried to speak with her, even offering gold for her knowledge, but she spurned me. She has rooms at the Mermaid's Gem, a private inn in the Sea Ward. If you could get information from her, or better yet, acquire her notes, I believe we might know more."
    "For your trouble so far, and for agreeing to this work, I offer you each a retainer of 10 gold coins! And if you can get me all the information on the Eye of Zaltec that I require, I'll give you each an additional 50 gold pieces."

---

## What does Harriot Redwind look like?

"She's an older stout halfling with reddish-brown hair and blue-green eyes. She's rarely seen without a pipe in her mouth."

## What sort of person is she?

"Not the nice kind. She's infamous for stealing her competitors' research, or worse, ambushing them and robbing their finds. If she transported the Eye of Zaltec from Chult, I doubt she found it herself."

## Does she have any friends, servants, or private security?

"I know only of one servant--another halfling who acts as a cook, butler, and traveling companion. I believe she referred to him as Rufus."

## Which room is she staying in at the inn?

"I met her outside the inn, but l've since learned she's staying somewhere on the third floor. I'm not sure which room."

## Does she have any special abilities or powers?

"I've heard she's a mage of some repute. Surviving in the wilds of Chult, as she has for many years, generally means you are either very adept or very lucky. Or both."

## Scoring Part 1

Use the scoring sheet from appendix B to tally the players' points. Scoring for part 1 is calculated as follows:

Rescuing Volo. Assign from 0 to 50 points for each player, based on the ingenuity of their answer and their flair for roleplaying:

- Assign 0 points for "I stab them" or similarly trite and unimaginative descriptions.
- Assign 30 points for an average attempt to narrate something fun and cool.
- Assign 50 points for an above-average attempt to make the moment memorable.
Total Points: $\qquad$ $(0-300)$

Bartering with Volo. Assign from 0 to 100 points to the group for negotiating a better retainer (as shown on the 'Bartering with Volo' table), with up to 50 bonus points for entertaining roleplaying.

Total Points: $\qquad$ $(0-150)$

Questioning Volo. Give 30 additional points for each of the listed questions that the characters ask.

Total Points: $\qquad$ $(0-150)$

If the players finish early, have the table captain stand so Open HQ knows you have completed this part.

TOTAL POINTS PART 1. $\qquad$ (600 max)

---

## Part 2. InM or Out

Time Limit: 1 hour
The characters attempt to gain access to the notes of halfling mage and infamous explorer Harriot Redwind, who is currently residing at the Mermaid's Gem, an inn in the Sea Ward.

## Preparing the Job

When the players begin this part, read:

The Sea Ward of Waterdeep houses the nobility, the wealthy, and those earning a living selling to those two groups. The Mermaid's Gem is a nicely appointed threestory building in a busy section of the Sea Ward. Surrounded by upscale dining establishments and shops, it's easy to get lost in the crowd.

Give the players Handout 3, a rough map of the Mermaid's Gem. This sketch represents all the characters initially know about the location. Once they've looked at it, read:

Your objectives are to acquire Harriot Redwind's research on the Eye of Zaltec and steal any valuables you can from the private inn. Harriot could leave at any time, so you need to act quickly. You now have one hour, real-time, to get inside the private inn and acquire her research through deception, theft, or diplomacy.

First, how does each of you prepare for the job? You have fifteen minutes to devise a plan!

The players have fifteen minutes to devise a plan for getting inside the private inn. During this planning phase, each character can take one preparation action. Inform the players that these actions could include:

- Buying equipment
- Creating disguises
- Forging identification
- Gathering information
- Hiring help
- Scouting the area
- Using a background feature

If a player wants to perform a preparation action that's not listed below, it's up to you to devise an appropriate benefit. Players can't perform actions that involve entering the premises or pose significant risks: these must be played out when the job begins!

## Buying Equipment

A character that takes this action can buy any equipment listed in chapter 5 of the Player's Handbook.

## Creating Disguises

Alama, Corvis, Mischief and Long Mei carry disguise kits and are proficient in their use. To create a disguise, they must spend 10 gp and make a Charisma (Deception) check with advantage. The check result is the DC required to see past the disguise with a Wisdom (Insight) check. Any number of disguises can be made with a single preparation action.

## Forging Identiflcation

Alama and Mischief carry forgery kits and are proficient in their use. To forge a document - for example, a bogus guild ID - they must spend 10 gp and make a Dexterity (Deception) check with advantage. The check result is the DC required to see past the forgery with a Wisdom (Insight) check. Any number of documents can be made with a single preparation action.

## Gathering Information

A character that takes this action can attempt a DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) or Charisma (Persuasion) check to learn one of the following pieces of information:
d6 Information
1 The inn's plumbing is overdue an inspection from the Cellarers' and Plumbers' Guild.
2 The private inn only allows guests with "good coin and noble breeding". Room prices start at 20 gp , paid upfront.
3 The inn's barman has a criminal history.
4 Harriot is hooked on a rare, Chultan pipeweed and is desperately hunting for a new supply.
5 Harriot is known to trap her belongings to deter thieves.
6 Harriot stays in Room 32

## Hiring Help

A character that takes this action can hire the services of a single bandit for 20 gp , or up to three urchin commoners for 5 gp each. The player controls these characters for the duration of this part. These hirelings are only contracted for the duration of this part of the adventure.

---

## Scouting the Area

A character that takes this action must make a Wisdom (Perception) check. The result of this check determines the amount of information gleaned from casing the area:

- DC 8: The doors are kept locked, and guests must use a key to enter the building via the front door. People wishing to enter the front door without a key must ring a bell on the front porch. Someone talks to them through a grate in the door, and then the door opens if the visitor provides a suitable reason to be granted entrance.
- DC 10: The rear entrance has a similarly locked door with a grate. Workers enter by knocking and having someone allow them in, although some staff are seen to possess keys.
- DC 12: At least two armed guards stand inside the front door of the inn, ensuring no trouble finds its way in.
- DC 14: Harriot is currently inside the inn. As she entered with a male drow escort dressed in fine clothes and chain armor, you saw her hand something to another halfling, who went to the back of the building, while Harriot used a key to enter the front door.
- DC 16: More members of the City Watch than usual are around.
- DC 18: Two drow are lurking near the inn, obviously staking it out. If they're also attempting to get to Harriot, you might need to act quickly.
Anyone taking this action must make a DC 10 Dexterity (Stealth) or Charisma (Deception) check to avoid attracting the suspicion of the City Watch, Harriot, and the drow. If they're seen, all future Charisma checks dealing with people in this part of the adventure are made at disadvantage.


## Using a Background Feature

The following characters have background features that could apply to this part, but they must ask to use them:

- Long Mei can perform outside the inn, earning an invitation from the barkeep to play in the lounge.
- Mischief can use her noble privilege to secure a room at the inn (room 2A) for the cost of 20 gp .
- Zashyda's criminal contact can acquire a counterfeit key for her to enter the building, but she warns her that she'll need to dress the part.


## Mermaid's Gem Layout

The following descriptions correspond to locations marked on the Mermaid's Gem Map.

## General Features

The Mermaid's Gem has the following features:
Ceilings. The ceilings in the inn are 10 feet high.
Illumination. Lanterns or windows provide bright light to all areas.

Smells and Sounds. The murmur of conversation, the plucking of a lute, the aroma of fine food from the kitchens.

## 1. Front Entrance

The lock on the front door can be picked with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check made by someone proficient with thieves' tools. Directly inside the door are two veterans who keep the place safe. They are particularly vigilant because of the gang war in Waterdeep and keep an eye on the door, the stairs, and all areas between. Unless the adventurers enter peacefully and show them a key, they shout an alarm and attack immediately.

## Gaining Access to the Inn

Many possibilities exist for getting inside the inn. Players could:

- Pick the lock on the front door and flash the guards a fake key, requiring a DC 15 Charisma (Deception) check.
- Pickpocket a key from a dwarf guest as he leaves the inn. Stealing the key requires a DC 12 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. Failure by 5 or more draws the attention of the City Watch (Shout for a Constable!).
- Ring the bell and request entrance. Entrance is only granted if the character shows at least 20 gp in wealth to pay for a room, or gives a reasonable excuse (seeking work, need to speak to one of the guests, etc.) and succeeds on a DC 18 Charisma (Deception or Persuasion) check.
- Pose as guild inspectors using a forged identification. The DC of the check to recognize it as counterfeit was determined by the forger when they forgery was made (see "Preparing the Job").


## 2. Lounge Bar

The lounge bar has many comfy chairs for guests to relax with a brandy and a broadsheet. Exotic paintings decorate the wood-paneled walls.

Behind the bar is the bartender and inn manager, a human named Gregander Juhl (use the spy stat block) who assists the guards in defending the inn. Gregander has a history with Alama, which could affect any roleplaying and skill checks in the downstairs area (see the 'Gregander the Barkeep' sidebar). The strongbox

---

behind the bar is currently unlocked and contains 250 gp .

Even if the adventurers con their way in, they still may not be free to go upstairs. If they want to speak to a guest, the bartender goes up and brings them down. Harriot refuses to speak to the characters unless they give a very good reason (such as access to Chultan tobacco), so the bartender probably sends them away.

Once inside, one way to gain upper-floor access without a fight is to create a distraction outside. This draws the guards' and bartender's attention away, allowing those succeeding at a DC 15 Dexterity (Stealth) check to get upstairs without being noticed.

Any fight in the lounge bar draws a city watch patrol (Shout for the Constable!).

## GREGANDER THE BARKEEP

Early in his career, Alama and his twin brother did jobs with Gregander, who escaped the life of crime and became the manager of the Mermaid's Gem. When Alama sees Gregander, tell Alama's player that Alama recognizes the barkeep from younger years on the street. With a DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) check, Alama can convince Gregander to cover for Alama and his friends. This negates one of the Shout for the Constable! moments in this part, but only one, and only if Alama makes the plea to Gregander. Alternatively, Alama could blackmail his old accomplice to gain the spare key to Harriot's room. This requires success on a DC 15 Charisma (Intimidation) check.

## 3. Rear Entrance

The rear door leads to the kitchen. Its lock can be picked with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check made by someone proficient with thieves' tools or forced open with a successful DC 15 Strength check, though the latter creates a ruckus (Shout for the Constable!). Attacking the door with weapons also draws the attention of City Watch immediately. While there are no guards at the door, kitchen staff are always present just inside.

## 4. KITCHENS

The kitchen staff (three commoners) are preparing exotic meals for their noble guests. This area is off-limits: unless the party makes a successful DC 15 group Dexterity (Stealth) check, they are spotted by one of the kitchen staff, who shouts a warning to the two veterans at the front door, who arrive in two rounds (Shout for the Constable!). The bartender (spy) backs up the veterans one round after they arrive to challenge the intruders.

Rufus, Harriot's personal cook and companion, is working in the kitchen when the adventurers enter. The package the characters may have seen Rufus take from Harriot contains a very rare and special pipeweed from Chult that Harriot became quite fond of, and quite addicted to. If threatened, Rufus passes this information to the characters to save his own skin. If they tell Rufus they can get more of the weed for Harriot and succeed on a DC 10 Charisma (Deception) check, Rufus volunteers to take them up to meet Harriot. This bypasses the guards and the bartender.

## 5. GUEST Rooms

The guest rooms are locked. A character proficient with thieves' tools can pick any lock with a successful DC 10 Dexterity check. Four of the rooms are occupied, and there's a $20 \%$ chance per room that the noble guest is present who attacks intruders and shrieks in alarm, calling for the veterans in area 1 who arrive in 1d4 rounds. Each occupied room contains 25 gp in valuables ( 100 gp in total for all four occupied rooms). No additional guards protect the upper floors, so no one challenges the adventurers once they gain access to these floors.

## 6. Harriot's Room

Harriot Redwind is staying in room 32 and is present when the characters arrive. Unless Rufus is with them, she refuses to open the door to anyone unless there's an offer of the rare Chultan pipeweed. Harriot can only be surprised if the intruders have been silent and avoided all confrontation until this point. See "Dealing with Harriot" below for details on how to handle exchanges with her.

Harriot is talking to Valonz Xavia, a drow pretending to be a traveling merchant from Chult, who is actually a member of Bregan D'aerthe. The charming drow is trying to take a case Harriot's room for her notes while discussing what Chultan antiquities he has to sell her. In reality he has none but is doing a good job hiding it.

If the characters get inside, Harriot's suite has four items of interest.

Bronze-Hinged Chest. This chest is locked and trapped. A successful DC 20 Dexterity check made by someone proficient with thieves' tool is required to open the chest. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check is required to find the magical trap, and a successful DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) or Intelligence (Arcana) check is needed to disable it. If the trap is sprung, everyone in the room (not the crab or the

---

parrot) takes 21 (6d6) psychic damage, with a successful DC 12 Constitution saving throw halving the damage. Inside the chest are a sack with 100 gp , two potions of healing, a wand of knock (3 charges), and Harriot's spellbook, which contains all the spells she has prepared.

Leather-Bound Book with a Gold Lock. This lock can be picked with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check with thieves' tools. The book is blank, except for the first page, which has a trapped arcane rune. The person opening the book must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, taking 32 (8d8) fire damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one.

Water-filled Tank with Crab. The rune-covered crab is Mr. Crabbypants, Harriot's rune-covered crab familiar. Her journal is in a waterproof pouch, buried under the gravel at the bottom of the tank. A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) or DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals the pouch peeking out of the gravel. A successful DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals a password hidden in the runes on Mr. Crabbypants that can deactivate the trap on the familiar's shell. If a character reaches into the tank without disarming the runes, Mr. Crabbypants lets out a spark, jolting the person for 11 (2d10) lightning damage. A person who takes damage from the trap on Mr. Crabbypant's shell must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw, to persevere and grab the pouch. On a failed saving throw, a character reflexively pulls a hand out of the water. The shock occurs every time the water is disturbed, and even triggers if poor Mr. Crabbypants is killed.

If the players find the journal, give them
Handout 4. The contents of the journal are summarized in the sidebar below.

Parrot in a Silver Birdcage. The parrot is a pet Harriot purchased in Chult. The parrot can talk a bit, and it insults the characters as they fight or search the room. It does know the password that can disarm the water tank trap attached to Mr. Crabbypants. A successful DC 10 Wisdom (Handle Animal) check coaxes the password ("Nyanzaru") out of the bird.

## Harriot's Journal

The journal reveals the following information:

- Harriot stole the Eye of Zaltec from adventurers in Chult and smuggled it into Waterdeep. One of the Lords of Waterdeep arranged to auction the gem for Harriot and split the proceeds with her, but she doesn't mention his name.
- Harriot knows the Eye of Zaltec once belonged to a powerful aboleth named Golorr, who went missing centuries ago. Chultan rumor has it that the ruby is still connected to Golorr in some way and can point the way to the aboleth.
- In addition to Volo, the Cassalanters noble family has been persistent in asking Harriot information about the ruby and paid her handsomely for a lead to her contact. She thinks they're planning to rob him for the gem and notes the location of their hideout: a ruined estate in the Sea Ward.


## Dealing with Harriot

Assuming the characters can get to Harriot's room and enter, she's not amused at their presence. They have one chance to convince her to even hear them. If that initial attempt fails, she demands they leave. If they refuse, she attacks, testing how strong they are as a fighting force, then she tries to escape when it is clear she cannot defeat them all (Shout for the Constable!).

Valonz watches this negotiation and steps in on Harriot's behalf, hoping to glean some information. If Corvis is part of the conversation, Valonz bitterly opposed to anything the character has to say. If a fight breaks out and Valonz can see Corvis, he attacks the half-elf, saying the character must, "Pay for his father's crimes!" If Corvis is nowhere to be found, Valonz flees when a fight breaks out (see "Interrogating Valonz").

## Negotiating with Harriot

The Charisma (Deception or Persuasion) check to get Harriot to listen should have a DC dependent on their tactics. Reasonable and calm characters can attempt a DC 15 check. Those using violent or intimidating methods must use DC 20 for the Charisma (Intimidation) check.

On a success, Harriot stays her attacks, telling the adventurers one thing: she cannot and will not provide her notes or any information on the Eye of Zaltec; however, she does explain the following:

- A noble family called the Cassalanters sought the same information. She refused, just as she does now, to provide it.
- Apparently the Cassalanters got the information they needed from a different source. She knows they're having a meeting tomorrow night at an abandoned estate in the Sea Ward.
- Harriot can provide an address, because the Cassalanters invited her there. Harriot doesn't intend to go in any case.

---

## Roleplaying Harriot Redwind

Harriot Redwind is as cunning and manipulative as she is smart and brave. She's not made it this far in life by giving away her research and valuable treasures for free. The adventurers do not have enough money or influence to pay for what they are asking of her.

Goal. Harriot's goal is to get the adventurers to leave without having to tell them anything. If they force her to provide information, she gives as little as possible.

Escalation. Harriot starts by using her words: point the adventurers to the Cassalanters and get them out of her hair. If they do not leave quickly or try to search her room, she attacks.

Subtle Casting. Harriot can, three times per day, cast a spell without needing to use verbal or somatic components. That means she can cast spells that don't require material components even when she is tied up, gagged, hiding, etc. The spell she can cast this way are noted in her stat block.

Portent. As a divination specialist, Harriot can use her portent ability to replace any attack roll, saving throw, or ability check made by her or a creature that she can see with one of these foretelling rolls. She must choose to do so before the roll, and she can replace a roll in this way only once per turn. Her rolls are 10 and 14.

## Fighting Harriot

If forced to attack, Harriot starts with greater invisibility, which allows her to move about without fear of being targeted directly. For persistent threats, she casts Mordenkainen's faithful hound in the room, which has the dual advantage of damaging her opponents and bringing the City Watch in 5 rounds (Shout for the Constable!)

If reduced to less than 10 hit points, Harriot uses mislead, misty step, or fly to get away out the shuttered windows (which she can open as part of her movement).

## Interrogating ValonZ

If Valonz is confronted about his problems with Corvis, a DC 12 Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) check get him to reveal that Corvis' father Felgazt Delco'sicet returned to the drow Underdark city of Menzoberranzan, bragging about the woman he had left on the surface with
child. As a follower of Lolth, Felgazt sacrificed Valonz's father, a servant of House Delco'sicet.

## Complication: Drow Attack!

If the characters complete this part with 15 minutes or more to spare, add this encounter as the characters leave the inn. Read or paraphrase:

As you return to the busy Sea Ward thoroughfare, six drow elves throw back their hoods and attack.

These six drow work for Bregan D'aerthe and were backing up Valonz Xavia. They attack for three rounds, focusing on anyone who looks like they might be carrying the notes. After three rounds, if they cannot down the person who they assume has the notes and grab them, they flee into the crowd as the City Watch arrives.

## Part 3. Devil of a Good Time

Time Limit: 1 hour
The characters explore a seemingly abandoned mansion and the hidden shrine to Asmodeus beneath the house to get one step closer to finding the Eye of Zaltec.

## Preparing the Job

The Cassalanter noble family is one step ahead of you in finding the Eye of Zaltec, and their trail has led to this abandoned mansion in the Sea Ward. Could their agents be meeting here to the discuss how they can acquire the gem?

The salty wind stings as you look at what remains of the boarded, crumbling Sea Ward mansion. To any passersby, it would seem like one of the few abandoned buildings in the richest neighborhood in Waterdeep.

Give the players Handout 5, a rough map of the ruined mansion. This sketch represents all the characters initially know about the location. Once they've looked at it, read:

Your objectives are to infiltrate the ruined manor, find out what the Cassalanters know about the Eye of Zaltec, and steal any valuables you can find. You now have one hour, real-time, to get inside and acquire the information.

First, how does each of you prepare for the job? You have fifteen minutes to devise a plan!

The players have fifteen minutes to devise a plan for getting inside the ruin. During this planning phase, each character can take one preparation action. Inform the players that these actions could include:

- Buying equipment
- Creating disguises
- Forging identification
- Gathering information
- Hiring help
- Scouting the area
- Using a background feature

If a player wants to perform a preparation action that's not listed below, it's up to you to devise an appropriate benefit. Players can't perform actions that involve entering the premises or pose significant risks: these must be played out when the job begins!

## Buying Equipment

A character that takes this action can buy any equipment listed in chapter 5 of the Player's Handbook.

## Creating Disguises

Alama, Corvis, Mischief and Long Mei carry disguise kits and are proficient in their use. To create a disguise, they must spend 10 gp and make a Charisma (Deception) check with advantage. The check result is the DC required to see past the disguise with a Wisdom (Insight) check. Any number of disguises can be made with a single preparation action.

## Forging Identiflcation

Alama and Mischief carry forgery kits and are proficient in their use. To forge a document - for example, a bogus City Watch ID - they must spend 10 gp and make a Dexterity (Deception) check with advantage. The check result is the DC required to see past the forgery with a Wisdom (Insight) check. Any number of documents can be made with a single preparation action.

## Gathering Information

A character that takes this action can attempt a DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) check to learn one of the following pieces of information:
d6 Information
1 A group of nobles meets here regularly as part of a wine-tasting club.

2 There used to be a secret door hidden somewhere in the library of the mansion.

3 A stern woman was seen unlocking a trapdoor in the garden with a key carried on her belt.

4 Strange screams are sometimes heard at night, coming from underneath the mansion.

5 Recently, some vials of truth serum were stolen from a nearby apothecary.

6 Visitors to the mansion always arrive wearing thick, black, hooded cloaks.

## Hiring Help

A character that takes this action can hire the services of a single bandit for 20 gp , or up to three urchin commoners for 5 gp each. The player controls these characters for the duration of this

---

part. These hirelings are only contracted for the duration of this part of the adventure.

## Scouting the Area

A character that takes this action must make a Wisdom (Perception) check. The result of this check determines the amount of information gleaned from casing the area:

- DC 10: The character spots recent human footprints of various sizes leading from the street to the front door.
- DC 12: The character hears muffled voices from within the walls and the occasional clink of glasses.
- DC 15: Humanoid figures wearing heavy black robes occasionally slip furtively into the manor from the street.
- DC 20: The character spots a trapdoor hidden beneath a pile of refuse in the garden.

Anyone taking this action must make a DC 10 Dexterity (Stealth) to avoid attracting the suspicion of the cultists. If they're seen, all future Charisma checks dealing with cultists in this part of the adventure are made at disadvantage.

## Using a Background Feature

The following characters have background features that could apply to this part:

- Alama can lead his companions through the sewers to emerge in the privies within the ruined manor.
- Caldra can discover that the manor's last owner was prosecuted for carrying out devil worship in the manor's basement.
- Zashyda's criminal contact can create a diversion for the City Watch, delaying any chance to Shout for the Constable! by 1d6 rounds.


## The Ruined Mansion

While most of the mansion has crumbled, a few rooms in its bottom floor remain intact, surrounded by crumbling walls. The following descriptions correspond to locations marked on the Ruined Mansion Map.

## General Features

The interior of the mansion has the following features: Ceilings. The ceilings in the mansion are 10 feet high. Illumination. Candles placed around the complex dimly light all areas.

Smells and Sounds. The remaining rooms in the mansion are musty, but the scents of wine and candles linger in the air along with hushed conversations and clinking glasses.

## 1. Overgrown Garden

The manor's garden is overgrown with high weeds and tangled trees. Characters who venture up the garden path can make a DC 10 Dexterity (Stealth) check to peer through the open archway into the Entry Parlor without being spotted.

If the characters search the garden, a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check uncovers a trapdoor hidden beneath a pile of refuse. The trapdoor is secured by a padlock and leads to the Shrine to Asmodeus at area 5. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check with thieves' tools picks the lock, and a successful DC 18 Strength check forces the trapdoor open. Forcing the door or otherwise creating a lot of noise attracts the two cultists in the Entry Parlor (area 2) and all the cultists in the shrine (area 5). Dreena Nartha (see "Dealing with the Cultists") carries a key to this trapdoor.

## We've Got Company

While the characters are exploring the garden, three human cultists in heavy black robes approach the mansion from the street. The characters must succeed on a DC 13 group Dexterity (Stealth) check to hide from them. If the characters fail the check, they are spotted and questioned by the cultists (see "Dealing with the Cultists"). If the cultists think the characters are lying, they dash for the house and Shout for the Constable!

## 2. Entry Parlor

Low candlelight fills this hazy chamber, which is surrounded by the crumbling walls of what was once a magnificent mansion. Voices murmur and glasses clink as black-robed figures stand about drinking red wine. Beyond them you can see the only doorway that isn't collapsed, leading to a library.

Two cultists, Merla Fulton and Gannon Drega, are sipping wine and talking quietly to cult fanatic Dreena Nartha when the characters enter. Dreena is Mischief's adopted mother and recognizes her immediately unless she's disguised (see "Dealing with the Cultists"). If the three cultists from area 1 arrived unmolested, Agnes Fulton, Gren Thorton, and Reirdra Elon are also in the room when the characters enter.

The cultists are all lesser Waterdhavian nobles. If the characters convince them they're here for the winetasting, Gannon moves into the library

---

(area 3) and stays there until they leave. If any character sticks around, Dreena is overheard gossiping about the Cassalanters, saying, "She knows their secrets and so they better be kind to her."

If Dreena is under the effects of truth serum (see area 3) or if a character gets her drunk and then succeeds on a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check, Dreena reveals that the Cassalanters "sold their son Osvaldo's soul to Asmodeus for wealth." After saying so, Dreena attempts to laugh this off as if it were a joke, but a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Insight) check reveals she's telling the truth. This information is very valuable to Caldra in her quest to expose corruption in the family.

## ROLEPLAYING DREENA NARTHA

Dreena Nartha is cruel, vain, and blunt. She's seventy, but thanks to an evil ritual involving devil ichor, she doesn't look a day over forty. When she meets new people, she judges them based on appearance and income, and is only interested in the beautiful and rich.

## 3. LIBRARY

Shelves of rotting tomes built into the wall stretch from floor to ceiling. Candles on a table set with ten corked wine bottles light the chamber. A draft of salty, musty air fills your senses.

This room holds extra wine and a secret entrance to the shrine of Asmodeus (area 5).

Secret Door. A successful DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) or DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals that one of the books on the bottom shelf isn't quite so musty as the others. Closer inspection reveals it is a lever disguised to look like a tome. When the lever is pulled, this section of bookshelves turns, revealing a stair down to area 5. Once opened, a successful DC 15 Strength check pushes the door back shut. If the door is left open for 1 minute, the cultists in area 2 investigate what's happening downstairs.

If the characters can't find the entrance to this door with an ability check, they must spend 10 minutes searching the room, which makes the cultists suspicious. In response, one of them offers the characters the truth serum wine (see "Wine Bottles").

Wine Bottles. These bottles are cheap, certainly less expensive than what's normally found at noble parties. One of them is laced with six doses of truth serum (see the "Truth Serum" sidebar). A character who examines this bottle and succeeds
on a DC 15 Intelligence check with alchemist's supplies can tell the wine is poisoned with truth serum. Alama has advantage on this check.

## Truth SERUM

A creature that ingests a dose of this poison must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 hour. The poisoned creature can't knowingly speak a lie, as if under the effect of a zone of truth spell.

## 4. Privy

This ruined privy is now little more than an open hole leading into the city's sewers.

Archways from this area lead into the Entry Parlor (area 2), and the Library (area 3).

## 5. Shrine to Asmodeus

As you descend the stairs you hear a soft chanting with a strange, almost melodic quality that makes your skin tingle. The chamber below is bathed in soft light that reveals a circle of hooded figures standing around a pool of blood. Beyond the chanters is a stone statue depicting a handsome, dark-haired human grinning wickedly and sitting upon a throne. A table near the stairs contains bloodstained instruments and weathered tomes. Behind the statue, a large cloth map is nailed to the wall, depicting the streets of Waterdeep's Dock Ward.

Four human cultists are completing a ritual to summon a devil (see "Complication: Shaxalon Summoned"). They're planning to ask the fiend for aid in kidnapping a Masked Lord of Waterdeep. The cultists are Cassalanter servants named Brea, Sigmund, Terrel, and Yvone.

The cultists have their eyes closed and constantly chant. If each character succeeds on a DC 11 Dexterity (Stealth) check, they can sneak around the cellar without the cultists noticing, but if they speak or cause any audible disturbance, the cultists notice.

Trapdoor to Backyard. The trapdoor to the backyard is locked from the outside with a padlock (see area 1).

Pool of Blood. The pool of blood is 1 foot deep. A creature that touches the blood that does not worship Asmodeus takes 5 (2d4) poison damage.

Statue. A successful DC 13 Intelligence (Religion) check identifies the statue as Asmodeus (Mischief automatically knows this). A successful

---

DC 14 Intelligence (Investigation) check identifies the throne beneath the figure as a hinged chest. The statue weighs 500 pounds and can be pushed off the throne as an action, but a successful DC 17 Strength check is required to lift it quietly enough that the cultists don't notice. A spell, like levitate, can also quietly lift the statue. The chest holds a potion of healing and 250 gp .

Map. Give the players Handout 6 if they study this map. The map depicts a winding carriage route through the Dock Ward's streets, with notes on City Watch response times. Prominently written on the map is "Thardouk Starbuckler's Carriage Route," "Carries Eye of Zaltec?" and a date for two days' hence. The Cassalanters are planning to rob Thardouk's wagon, as they've learned he knows where the Eye of Zaltec is kept.

Books. A successful DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check made while searching the books reveals a note stuffed into one of them that reads "Laeral Silverhand, Mirt, Ominifus Dran, Thardouk Starbuckler." The characters know that Laerel is the Open Lord of Waterdeep, while Mirt and Ominifus Dran are Masked Lords whose identities are widely suspected. They can deduce that Thardouk is somehow related.

Cultists. Brea carries a scroll case that holds the schematics of Thardouk's carriage (Handout 7). If a character spies on the cultists while they chant, a successful DC 11 Wisdom (Perception) check notices the case hanging from the back of her belt. A successful DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check steals the case without her noticing.

Table. A successful DC 18 Intelligence (Investigation) check identifies the outline of a secret drawer in the table. A detect magic spell reveals the drawer radiates an aura of abjuration magic. The drawer is locked but can be picked with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check made with thieves' tools. A successful DC 13 Strength check forces the drawer open. If forced, or if a lockpicking check fails by 5 or more, a magic rune on the inside of the drawer lets lose a shriek that can be heard by all creatures in the mansion.

The drawer holds love letters from Thardouk Starbuckler to his lover Welton Smalltree, a servant of the Cassalanters and certainly not Thardouk's wife. The Cassalanters set up this affair and plan to use the letters to blackmail Thardouk.

## Dealing With the Cultists

The cultists gathered in the mansion are led by the Cassalanters noble family and meet nightly before
going out to the various parties hosted in the Sea Ward.

## Wine-Tasting Party

The cultists in the ground level of the mansion are pretending to have a wine-tasting party. They claim the air in the drafty mansion is just right for letting the wine breathe. A successful DC 13 Wisdom (Insight) check reveals they're lying about this. Being proficient with brewer's supplies, Caldra or Long Mei immediately notice the wine is poor quality upon tasting it.

The cultists ask the characters what they're doing in the mansion. A successful DC 13 Charisma (Deception) check convinces them the characters are in the house for the wine-tasting. A successful DC 17 Charisma (Deception) check is required to convince them they're cultists of Asmodeus, in which case the nobles show the characters to the hidden shrine (area 5).

If the characters fail a Charisma (Deception) check or mention the Eye of Zaltec, the cultists serve them wine dosed with truth serum (see area 3). If the characters get caught in a lie after the truth serum is served, the cultists attack. A cultist flees when reduced to half its hit points.

## Interrogating Captive Cultists

A successful DC 15 Charisma (Intimidation) gets a captured cultist to reveal the door to the shrine in area 5 and admit that a map within shows the location of the Eye of Zaltec. A successful DC 18 Charisma (Intimidation) check gets a cultist to reveal more information by sharing the location of the schematics of Thardouk's coach, the love letters, or the list of Lords of Waterdeep (see area 5).

## Family Reunion

If Dreena Nartha spots Mischief, she immediately approaches, demanding to know what her adopted daughter is doing at the party. Charisma checks made to influence Dreena are made at disadvantage after she sees Mischief.

## Complication: Shaxalon Summoned

If the characters search the cellar and get the map of the Dock Ward with 15 minutes or more to spare, add this encounter before the characters leave the room. Read or paraphrase:

The blood bubbles and hisses for a moment as terrible claws reach out of the grotesque pool.

---

The characters have one round before Shaxalon, a barbed devil, claws her way into the world. Characters who succeed on a DC 18 Stealth (Dexterity) check can hide from Shaxalon. At the start of the next round, read or paraphrase:

Foul sulfur stings your senses as a beast over six feet tall steps from the pool. Blood runs down her green skin, which is flecked with threatening black barbs. The fiend grins as she takes in the air of the Material Plane.

## Roleplaying Shaxalon

Shaxalon was summoned to help the Cassalanters raid Thardouk's wagon. She has worked with the noble family before.

If Shaxalon is welcomed by the cultists and doesn't notice the characters, she asks the cultists to show her the map, so she can review the plan for attacking Thardouk's carriage. If the map isn't hanging on the wall, the cultists raise the alarm throughout the mansion and search every inch of it for intruders. When the characters are found, the cultists attack.

If Shaxalon notices a character hiding, she attacks immediately.

If the characters are the only living creatures in the shrine, Shaxalon thinks they're cultists sent to meet her, and any dead bodies in the shrine were required for the ritual to summon her. The characters can convince her they work for the Cassalanters with a successful DC 15 Charisma (Deception) check. Mischief has advantage on this check. If the characters fail to convince Shaxalon, she attacks. If they succeed, she shares the following information during her conversation with them:

- "I'm eager to capture Thardouk Starbuckler and please the Cassalanters so I may return to the Nine Hells."
- "When we capture the Waterdhavian lord, I shall make him speak. There'll be no need for blackmail letters."
- "I hear the coward Thardouk hides in a metallic beast. We'll stop that beast in its tracks now that we have a drawing of its entrails."

When she's done speaking with the characters, Shaxalon demands a disguise so she can travel to Cassalanter Villa. The characters could fashion her a suitable disguise out of items them have (they must cover her face and body) or cast a spell to hide the devil, such as invisibility. If they don't help Shaxalon, she heads up to area 2 to ask any cultists there for help. If they're dead or gone, she realizes the characters' deception and attacks.

## Part 4. Stand and Deliver

Time Limit: 1 hour.
In this part, the characters hijack Thardouk Starbuckler's carriage to question him about the Eye of Zaltec. During the ambush, they find themselves caught in a crossfire between the Xanathar Guild and Manshoon's Zhentarim.

## ROLEPLAYING THARDOUK STARBUCKLER

Thardouk Starbuckler is a disreputable festhall proprietor who sits on Waterdeep's council of Masked Lords. He's currently having an affair with Welton Smalltree and visits him daily in the Dock Ward. Thardouk has many enemies and learned to take precautions when traveling across the city. Recently, the scholar Harriot Redwind approached Thardouk to arrange the auction of a fabled gem called the Eye of Zaltec. Thardouk was good to his word, but Harriot subsequently spilled key details of the deal to members of Waterdeep's criminal underbelly. Thardouk is a paunchy half-elf with a conspicuous soft spot for good food. Quote: "Ah, the world pivots on the smallest things: turning left not right, frowning when you should smile, drinking instead of going home..."

## Preparing the Job

The Cassalanters believe that a noble called Thardouk Starbuckler has the Eye of Zaltec. They plan to rob the gem from him in two days' time. If you act fast, you can hijack his carriage today as he passes through the Dock Ward.

The players already have Handout 6, a map of Thardouk's route through the Dock Ward. If they're lucky, they also have Handout 7, a schematic of Thardouk's carriage. Once they're ready, read:

Your objective is to hijack Thardouk's carriage, steal the Eye of Zaltec from him (or find out where it is), and steal any other valuables he carries. You now have one hour, realtime, to complete your objectives.

First, how does each of you prepare for the job? You have fifteen minutes to devise a plan!

The players have fifteen minutes to devise a plan for hijacking the carriage. During this planning phase, each character can take one preparation action. Inform the players that these actions could include:

- Buying equipment
- Creating disguises
- Forging identification
- Gathering information
- Hiring help
- Scouting the area
- Using a background feature

If a player wants to perform a preparation action that's not listed below, it's up to you to devise an appropriate benefit. Players can't perform actions that pose significant risks: these must be played out when the job begins!

## BuYing EQUIPMENT

A character that takes this action can buy any equipment listed in chapter 5 of the Player's Handbook.

## Creating Disguises

Alama, Corvis, Mischief and Long Mei carry disguise kits and are proficient in their use. To create a disguise, they must spend 10 gp and make a Charisma (Deception) check with advantage. The check result is the DC required to see past the disguise with a Wisdom (Insight) check. Any number of disguises can be made with a single preparation action.

## Forging IDENTIFICATION

Alama and Mischief carry forgery kits and are proficient in their use. To forge a document - for example, a bogus roadworker's ID - they must spend 10 gp and make a Dexterity (Deception) check with advantage. The check result is the DC required to see past the forgery with a Wisdom (Insight) check. Any number of documents can be made with a single preparation action.

## GATHERING INFORMATION

A character that takes this action can attempt a DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) check to learn one of the following pieces of information:

---

| d6 | Information |
| :-- | :-- |
| 1 | Thardouk recently hired a third mounted <br> bodyguard. |
| 2 | Thardouk has planted lookouts on the Rake. |
| 3 | There are lots of good hiding places on Bucket <br> Lane. |
| 4 | Thardouk's driver carries a wand of fear. |
| 5 | Spies from the Zhentarim are shadowing <br> Thardouk's carriage. |
| 6 | Thardouk is an unscrupulous villain who'll cut a <br> deal with anyone to save his own skin. |

## Hiring Help

A character that takes this action can hire the services of a single bandit for 20 gp , or up to three urchin commoners for 5 gp each. The player controls these characters for the duration of this part.

## Scouting the Area

A character that takes this action must make a Wisdom (Perception) check. The result of this check determines the amount of information gleaned from casing the area:

- DC 8: Acolytes of Ilmater often parade up and down Chapel Street, dressed in hooded cloaks.
- DC 10: The old bell tower on Turnagain Lane looks deserted, and surely offers a fine view of the surrounding streets.
- DC 12: Discarded crates and barrels offer plenty of good hiding places along Bucket Lane.
- DC 14: Gangs of urchins like to play skip-rope on Sawbone Alley.
- DC 16: The cobblestones on Tin Dragon Alley are weak, and in places have subsided into the sewer tunnel below. Wooden planks have been laid to cover up these rents.
- DC 18: Thardouk has planted 4 loyal bandits on the Rake to watch for trouble.

Anyone taking this action must make a DC 10 Dexterity (Stealth) to avoid attracting the suspicion of the bandits of the Rake. If they're spotted, any Dexterity (Stealth) or Charisma (Deception) checks made in view of the bandits are made at disadvantage.

## Using a Background Feature

The following characters have background features that could apply to this part:

- Corvis can use his connections in the Temple of Ilmater to arrange a prayer march down Chapel Lane, halting the carriage while it passes by.
- Zashyda's criminal contact can create a diversion for the City Watch, delaying any chance to Shout for the Constable! by 1d6 rounds.


## District Locations

The Cassalanter's map shows a small section of the Dock Ward. This comprises the following streets:

## Bucket Lane

Rainwater sloshes from the roofs of Chapel Street to fester in this muddy lane. It's quiet down here, and discarded crates are stacked higgledy-piggledy against the buildings.

This street is quiet, and the City Watch takes 8 rounds to respond to incidents. Characters can use the crates as hiding places for an ambush.

## Chapel Street

Wonky tenements huddle over a cobblestone street lined with market stalls. Bells toll from the chapel at the far end, but their clangor is drowned out by the yells of street hawkers and town criers.

This street is crowded, and the City Watch take 12 rounds to respond to incidents. Acolytes and worshipers rub shoulders with stall holders and their customers, creating lots of possibilities for disguises.

## SaWbone Alley

This narrow street is home to apothecaries and barber surgeons. Signboards creak and clatter in the breeze, each cunningly placed to block the view of its neighbor.

This street is busy, and the City Watch take 16 rounds to respond to incidents. Urchin children often play here, hoping for alms from the apothecaries.

---

## The RaKe

A shabby boulevard snakes through the district. Private clubs and bookstores give the Rake a whiff of respectability, but the paupers on the street corners sing a different story.

This street is busy, and the City Watch take 8 rounds to respond to incidents. Thardouk has planted four bandit lookouts among the crowd (each bandit has a passive Insight of 12). If they sense trouble, they release a scarlet songbird from a cage as a signal to divert his carriage down Sawbone Alley.

## Tin Dragon Alley

Empty wash lines sag across the alley, and the window sills are heaped with bird dung. Tarnished tin coins are nailed to the walls along the alley's length.

This street is quiet, and the City Watch take 12 rounds to respond to incidents. Wooden planks cover yawning potholes in the street. Thardouk's carriage upturns if it hits one of these potholes.

## Turnagain Lane

Shrieking crows wheel above this dead-end street, and beggars huddle under its porches. Most buildings have bill posters declaring them condemned or for sale. At the far end, a lonely bell tower claws at the heavens.

This street is quiet, and the City Watch take 16 rounds to respond to incidents. Thardouk's carriage won't turn down here unless the driver is tricked somehow. Climbing the bell tower offers a clear view of the whole district.

## Executing the Hijack

When the players are ready to execute their plan, read:

Drizzle falls with grim determination over the Dock Ward: an uncompromising rain that gets in your lungs and soaks the undersides of your hoods. The Waterdhavians continue their business with native grit, oblivious to the chaos soon to be unleashed on their streets. Ahead, Thardouk Starbuckler's carriage slowly turns onto the Rake...

The carriage follows the route shown on the Handout 6. Thardouk and his guards comprise the following NPCs:

- Thardouk is a half-elf noble. He remains inside the carriage.
- The carriage driver is a martial arts adept who carries a wand of fear ( 7 charges). Four draft horses pull the carriage.
- Three guards escort the carriage on riding horses: two ahead of the carriage and one behind.


## Congestion

Each street shown on the map has a congestion rating that determines the maximum speed of all creatures and vehicles moving at ground level:

| Congestion | Maximum speed |
| :-- | :-- |
| Crowded | 15 feet |
| Busy | 25 feet. |
| Quiet | No restriction |

As a bonus action, a creature can attempt a DC 12 Charisma (Intimidation) check to scare the pedestrians. On a success, they can move at full speed for that turn. The crowds also scatter if combat breaks out, taking 4 rounds to clear the street if it is crowded, and 2 rounds if it is busy.

## Stopping the Carriage

Thardouk is wary of ambushes, ordering his driver to keep moving if anyone attempts to stop them. The driver shouts at bystanders to clear out of her way, but she stops short of ploughing through them. If enemies block her path, she charges at full pelt, using her wand of fear to open a hole in their ranks. If she's diverted for any reason--to escape an ambush, for example--she steers the carriage back on route at the earliest opportunity. Characters spying on her must overcome her passive Insight of 15 to avoid drawing attention to themselves (character have advantage on this roll if they're in disguise).

If Thardouk is confronted with evidence of his affair, he invites his blackmailers inside his carriage to discuss terms. Thardouk is keen for his wife to remain ignorant of his lover and offers his blackmailers 100 gp to keep silent. This is a good time to spring the Xanathar Guild tail (see 'Caught in the Crossfire').

---

## ThARDOUK'S CARRIAGE

The carriage is pulled by four draft horses. It has a formidable array of mechanical and magical defenses, as shown on carriage schematic handout.

Ejector Seat. Thardouk can pull a lever to eject the seats in front of him through the roof hatch. Characters on these seats when they're ejected must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be thrown clear of the carriage, taking 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage and landing prone on the street. Characters who succeed on the save are struck by the seats and fall prone inside the carriage.

Shuttered Windows. At the press of a button, the driver can lower steel shutters over the carriage windows. Each shutter has AC 12, 8 hit points, and is immune to psychic and poison damage.

Reinforced Wheels. The carriage wheels are of fine dwarven make and are almost impossible to damage. Each wheel has AC 14, 18 hit points, and is immune to psychic and poison damage.

Bolt Locks. The doors are bolted from the inside and can only be opened with a knock spell or by smashing through them (DC 18 Strength check to break).

Electrified Door Handles. Creatures that touch the door handles while the windows are shuttered must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 5 (2d4) lightning damage. If they remain in contact with the handle, they must repeat the saving throw at the start of each of their turns.

Air Vents. Holes drilled into the underside of the coach allow Thardouk to breathe when the shutters are lowered.

Roof Hatch. The roof hatch is also bolted from the inside. Thardouk tries to escape through the hatch if all else fails.

## City Watch

The "District Locations" section shows how many rounds it takes the City Watch to arrive following a disturbance. After this time, you can Shout for the Constable!

## CaUGHT IM THE Crossfire

Gangsters from the Xanathar Guild are secretively tailing Thardouk in their own coach. They follow cautiously and move in as soon as their quarry is threatened. Zhentarim agents shadow the gangsters from the air: when things go south, they launch an attack on all fronts.

Players who surveil Thardouk's coach can identify the tail on a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Insight) check. The Zhentarim hang-gliders can't be spotted until they strike.

## The Xamathar Tail

A carriage containing three bugbears from the Xanathar Guild enters the fray after three rounds of combat or chasing. Read:

A carriage pulled by frothing horses clatters up behind Thardouk's own coach. Bugbears cling to the sideboards, their faces full of murderous intent. Their leader has a scar in the shape of an eye etched into his forehead.
"Give 'im up!" he shouts. "Thardouk's ours now!"

The bandits attempt to kidnap Thardouk and question him about the Eye of Zaltec. Any characters who get in their way are attacked. If the Xanathar bugbears spot Long Mei or Zashyda, they stop at nothing to kill them.

## ZHENTARIM HANG-GLIDERS

Two rounds after the Xanathar Guild gangsters attack, two Zhentarim bards drop from the skies. Read:

Something large swoops overhead, and a hooded figure drops nimbly to the cobbles ahead of you. Moments later, a winged contraption made from canvas and wood clatters to the ground behind him. The figure bows as another glider swoops down behind him.
"Thardouk Starbuckler belongs to Manshoon now. Hand him over or there'll be blood."

This is Calar, Alama's brother (see the 'He Ain't Heavy...' sidebar). Unless persuaded otherwise, Calar and his companion attack the characters and the Xanathar Guild gangsters indiscriminately in their effort to kidnap Thardouk. To keep things simple, have them attack a different group each round.

If the characters steal a glider or two, they can prove useful when infiltrating the auction house in part 8 .

## He AIN'T Heavy...

Calar sided with Manshoon in the schism that divided the Zhentarim, putting him at odds with his own brother Alama. If he sees Alama here, he tries to persuade him to step aside. Calar won't raise his weapons against his own brother and can be persuaded to withdraw if Alama succeeds on a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check. Grant advantage to this check if the player roleplays the moment well.

## ThardOUk's Bargain

Thardouk's objective is to escape the area unharmed. When the gangsters first appear, he tries to buy the characters' loyalty. Read:

---

As his enemies close in, Thardouk shakes a large purse of jingling coins.
"Whatever you want, it can't be as bad as what those lot are planning! Scratch my back now, and I'll scratch yours. Information, gold... just GET ME OUT OF HERE!"

Thardouk is only good to his word if the players stick with him. If he sees an opportunity to escape, he takes it!

## Questioning Thardouk

If the characters question Thardouk about the Eye of Zaltec, he reveals the following information:

- The scholar Harriot Redwind approached Thardouk to arrange a private auction for the Eye of Zaltec, which adventurers unearthed from the Tomb of the Nine Gods in Chult.
- Thardouk was good to his word. The auction is to take place during the Cynosure Ball on Lliira's Night. Thardouk reveals the location of the auction house - Vocasca Manor in the Sea Ward - but warns it's invitation only. He can't help getting tickets: they're all sold out.
- Thardouk knows someone who may be able to help with getting inside. Give the players the information from the Secret Informant Form you collected earlier from HQ, for use in part 5. Give the characters the information on this form but do not give them the sheet.


## Treasure

Thardouk carries 200 gp in his purse. He gladly pays this to the characters if they rescue him from his pursuers. Thardouk also has a small casket sewn into his sleeve containing 5 gems worth 50 gp each. The casket is magically locked and can only be opened with a knock spell or if a character kisses the pearl set into its lid. A small inscription around the casket reads:

A gift without measure, a matter of course, Best taken with pleasure, not taken by force.

## Complication: BRegan D'aerthe

If you finish this part with at least 15 minutes to spare, a pair of drow spies from Bregan D'aerthe arrive to bargain for Thardouk's "safe passage." This encounter is best triggered during Thardouk's interrogation.

Two drow warriors dressed in black and purple finery emerge from a nearby alley. One carries a parasol to shield them from the rain - or more likely, the sun. His teeth are filed into points, like a shark.
"Perhaps you'd be amenable to a bargain?"

The drow offer the characters a pouch of 100 gp if they hand over Thardouk alive: a sum they're willing to pay. If the characters refuse, the spies attack. Of course, Thardouk pleads with the characters not to hand him over!

## Scoring: Part 4

Use the scoring sheet from Appendix B to tally the players' points. Scoring for Part 4 is calculated as follows:

| Question Thardouk for the lead | $+200$ |
| :-- | :-- |
| Good roleplay for Alama and Calar | $+10-50$ |
| Solve the riddle on Thardouk's casket | +100 |
| Characters inflicted no damage | +100 |
| Defeat or escape the drow | $+100$ |
| Valuables Stolen (max 550 gp) | $+1 / \mathrm{gp}$ |
| Recover the hang gliders | +50 |
| Character was reduced to 0 hp | -50 |
| Character was killed | -100 |
| Characters killed Thardouk | -150 |
| Characters killed an NPC (each)* | -100 |
| Characters damaged a NPC (each)* | -50 |

## Part 5. The Informant

Time Limit: 45 minutes
The characters must find a criminal informant and question them for information about the Eye of Zaltec.

## OVERVIEW

Part 5 of the adventure goes beyond the traditional rules and play styles of D\&D. The informant your group is looking for is played by another DM, and you play another group's informant. Here's an overview of how this section plays out:

- Before the event begins, create your own informant using the guidelines in this section and fill in the Secret Informant Form (see "Creating an Informant").
- When you arrive at the event, take your Secret Informant Form to the Open HQ, and take a different form for yourself. (see "Take a Form, Leave a Form").
- When the characters question Thardouk in Part 4, use the form to name the NPC informant the players are looking for. At the start of Round Two, send your group searching for the DM who plays that informant, and wait for another DM's group to find you (see "Swap Groups").
- When the other DM's group finds you, roleplay a scene with them (see "Playing Your Informant"). Use the Part 5 Score Sheet from appendix B.
- Once the visiting players have all the information they need, send them back to their original table with the "Part 5 Score Sheet" for the other DM. Then welcome your original group back and ask for their score sheet (see "Swap Back").

You are advised to cosplay the whole event as your contact, or at least wear a distinguishing article of clothing so you can be recognized.

## Creating an Informant

You must create a criminal NPC that another group of players pumps for information about the Eye of Zaltec. The characters learn the name of this NPC informant in part 4 from Thardouk Starbuckler. Most of the details of this character are up to you, save for what follows in this section.

As you go through the steps to create your NPC informant, fill out the information on the Secret Informant Form.

## FACTiON

Choose one of the following factions to which your NPC informant belongs: Xanathar Guild, Manshoon's Zhentarim, Bregan D'aerthe, or the Cassalanters' Cult of Asmodeus. Record your choice on the Secret Informant Form.

## SECRET Phrase and Response

Your NPC informant must have a unique secret phrase that a group of players uses to identify you. Make this secret phrase easy to remember and inoffensive. It should be no more than a short sentence like, "Drizzt Do'Urden has one I," or "I've never held a beholder." Write this phrase down so you remember it.

You should also come up with a response to the phrase, something you speak back to the players to let them know they've found you; like, "And Jarlaxle has none," or, "But I have bared an owlbear." Write down this response so you remember it.

## DISTINGUISHING FEATURES

Record something distinguishable about your outfit on the Secret Informant Form. The more noticeable and unique, the better. You can also have more than one distinguishing feature to make things easier.

## Names and Table Number

Record the name of your NPC, your real name, and your table number on the Secret Informant Form.

## DETAILS

Have fun creating the details for your informant. Write down the answer to these questions somewhere you can reference (not on the form):

- What race is your informant?
- What does your informant do for their faction?
- How does your informant's voice sound?
- What does your informant look like?
- What are your informant's personality traits?
- What is your informant's ideal?
- What is your informant's bond?
- What is your informant's flaw?


## Look the Part

You don't have to put on a costume and dress as your informant, but those DMs who do will earn an additional AL reward for one of their characters. The DM with the best costume as

---

deemed by the convention staff wins the unique Best Dressed Informant Award (see Handout 25)!

## Take a Form, Leave a Form

Seal your form in an envelope, drop it at Open HQ, and then take a different sealed form left by another DM. The form you take is the NPC you describe in part 4 and then send your group to meet!

## Swap Groups

After the break, read:


#### Abstract

Thardouk Starbuckler told you about a person who could help get you into the auction house. You'll want to write down the information I'm about to share. After some digging, you learned that [NAME OF OTHER DM'S INFORMANT] works for [FACTION]. This person wears [COLOR OF OTHER DM'S CLOTHES] garments and lives at [OTHER DM's TABLE NUMBER] Delzorin Street in the North Ward. The informant is only willing to talk with you if you speak these words when you find them: [SECRET PHRASE]. They will say [SECRET RESPONSE] back to you. This informant is played by another DM in this room. You need to get up from the table, find them, and question them about the Eye of Zaltec's whereabouts if you hope to find it. If there is another group at that DM's table when you arrive, please wait quietly for the DM to finish up with them before you approach.


Give your group five minutes to find the other informant (this five minutes is just to find the other informant, the rest of the time allotted for this part can be spent questioning the informant). If they return having not found their informant, tell them the informant's table number and the real name of the DM playing that informant.

## Welcoming the Other DM's Group

Once your group leaves the table, another DM's group should come looking for you. If they speak the phrase to you, respond appropriately, and then ask them to sit down at the table. Play out the next scene as the NPC informant you created.

## Playing Your Informant

With the other DM's group seated at the table, it's time to bring your criminal informant to life. Introduce yourself as the NPC to the characters
and tell them you want to have a chat before getting down to business.

## icebreaker Questions

Ask the characters the following questions and give each a chance to respond. Award inspiration to characters who roleplay an excellent response:

- Ask Alama, "Ah your face is familiar, but your name is not. Do you have a relative I might know?"
- Ask Caldra, "Oh I know you! You're in Force Grey. Tell me about your most recent mission... that one that was all over the broadsheets!"
- Ask Corvis, "Not from around here, eh? What do you know of your father's people?"
- Ask Long Mei, "The famous fighter! I watched your bout in '81 at an inn in Mistshore. Who was it you fought again and how did it turn out?"
- Ask Mischief, "I see you work for the Lord's Alliance. Why do you serve the nobles of Waterdeep?"
- Ask Zashyda, "Nasty wound, that eye. How did you get it?"


## Questioning the informant

After the characters answer your questions, it's time to get down to business. Reveal the following information:

- The gem is due to be auctioned off tomorrow night during the Cynosure Ball, on Lliira's Night in Summertide. The party is taking place at Vocasca Manor in the Sea Ward, a mansion that belongs to the Vocasca noble family.
- The informant gives the players Handout 8, a rough map of Vocasca Manor.
Tell the players that you (the NPC informant) can help them get inside the auction house to steal the Eye of Zaltec, but you demand payment.

Each numbered piece of information that follows costs 50 gp . A character can attempt a DC 15 Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) once during their interaction with the NPC, gaining a piece of information for free on a success. Grant advantage on this check if they roleplay the negotiation well.

If you need statistics for your informant (to resist a dose of truth serum poison, for instance), use the bandit captain. If the characters attack the informant, the informant flees. If they persist or attempt to give chase, Shout for the Constable! Should this occur, skip "The Deal" section below and move on to "Swap Back!"

| Informant Knowledge |  |
| :--: | :--: |
| Order | Information |
| 1 | Guests enter the manor through the front door, where armed guards check invitations against the guest list. Guests must be dressed in formal ballroom attire and come from noble stock. |
| 2 | The Eye of Zaltec resides in the private auction room on the second floor. Getting inside requires obtaining a special gold coin. The informant doesn't know what this special coin looks like. |
| 3 | The auction room remains locked until the ninth bell, when Lady Vocasca opens it to her selected guests. Magical defenses are in place to deter thieves while the room is empty. |
| 4 | Lady Vocasca has extra private auction coins that she's promised to award to guests who impress her. |
| 5 | Throughout the night, extra supplies of champagne and food are due to be delivered by Vocasca's suppliers. These arrive on carts at the garden gate, where servants carry them into the kitchens. |
| 6 | Waiting staff are dressed flamboyantly as masked angels. Spare costumes are kept in the kitchen stores. |
| 7 | The majordomo of the manor, Grigrof Mug, claims to know all the servants under his charge. He'll be on duty on the grand staircase in the lobby. |
| 8 | The Eye of Zaltec will be hidden inside a draped box. The gem is secured by a combination lock, set by Lady Vocasca herself. Only she knows the passcode. |
| 9 | If the gem is removed by force, it's warded to trigger a loud alarm. |
| 10 | Security has set up headquarters inside the mansion's study. The knight in charge, Stef Salindram, has a file of information on all guests. |
| 11 | The security guards wear red tabards emblazoned with the Vocasca coat of arms. These uniforms shouldn't be hard to recreate but be wary that many of the guards know each other. |

12 The informant has found out that spies from the Xanathar Guild, Manshoon's Zhentarim, the Cassalanter noble family, and the Bregan D'aerthe are planning to steal the gem on the same night. You'd do well to eliminate them from the game before you make your move - or they beat you to it!

13 The Xanathar Guild agent is onsite in the kitchens, posing as a cook called Masol Ketsk.

14 The Zhentarim agent is present as the human noble Lady Livi Mosse, a legitimate dignitary of Waterdeep. She'll be somewhere around the ballroom.
15 The Cassalanter agent is posing as a guard called Kalreve Nobleglide. She's assigned to patrol Lady Vocasca's quarters.
16 The Bregan D'aerthe agent wears a hat of disguise to appear as the Amnian Prince Kiro Coldtide. He'll be in the ballroom.

## Questions about the EYe of Zaltec

If the players think to ask about the gem's powers, the informant reveals the following information:

- The Eye of Zaltec has a magic power. It can lead characters to another gem called the Stone of Golorr. This gem can store memories.
- It's rumored that the memories within the Stone of Golorr lead to the Vault of Dragons, a hidden treasure cache somewhere beneath Waterdeep.


## The Deal

Once the characters have enough information, the informant offers them a deal: if they agree to sell the Eye of Zaltec to the informant's faction leader, the informant promises to aid them during the heist. The informant offers a fixed price of 30,000 gp for the gem, but insists the character submit to a geas spell to uphold the terms of the deal.

Give the characters 5 minutes to discuss, and they MUST make their decision at the end of this time. If the characters accept, the geas is immediately cast and they automatically fail their saving throws.

---

## Swap Back

After the characters take or refuse the deal, fill out the Part 5 Score Sheet from appendix B, seal it in an envelope or fold it in half, and tell the players to give it to their DM when they return to their original table. Allow that group to leave and welcome your original group back.

Your group should come back with a Part 5 Score Sheet filled out by another DM. Look at this card to see if your group took the deal that was offered to them. You'll need the card again for tallying the final score.

## Scoring Part 5

Use the Part 5 Scorecard from Appendix B to tally the players' points.

Finding the Informant. If the players find their information in under 5 minutes, award them up to 250 points (for every minute that passes, deduct 50 points from the total).

## Part 6. Time for a Plan

Time Limit: 45 minutes
The characters must gear up and devise a plan to steal the Eye of Zaltec.

## OVERVIEW

This part of the adventure is all about allowing the characters to plan and prepare for their heist to steal the Eye of Zaltec. At the start of this part, give the players Handout 9: Planning Sheet and Handout 10: Available Gear.

## Preparing the Job

This is it! Your objective is to infiltrate the Cynosure Ball at Vocasca Manor, get inside the private auction, and steal the Eye of Zaltec from under the nobles' noses. You now have 45 minutes to devise a plan! Any gold spent here won't affect your score - so spend what you can!

The players have 35 minutes to devise a plan for stealing the Eye of Zaltec. They now have Handout 8, a rough map of Vocasca Manor, and Handout 10, a list of special gear they can buy for the job. Advise them to jot down the details of their plan on Handout 9.

During this planning phase, each character can take one preparation action. Inform the players that these actions could include:

- Buying equipment*
- Crafting equipment*
- Gathering information
- Hiring help
- Scouting the area
- Using a background feature
*Includes new options for this part.
If a player wants to perform a preparation action that's not listed below, it's up to you to devise an appropriate benefit. Players can't perform actions that pose significant risks: these must be played out when the job begins!


## Buying EQUIPMENT

A character that takes this action can buy any equipment listed in chapter 5 of the Player's Handbook. In addition, the following special gear is available:

- Grappling Hook Gun. This modified heavy crossbow shoots a grappling hook and 50 feet of rope up to 50 feet. As a ranged attack action you can shoot the grapnel and rope and then
(assuming you hit) press another button to reel in an unattended object you hit with it. Reloading the crossbow with a new rope and grapnel requires an action. The crossbow fires bolts normally. Each grappling hook gun costs 150 gp and comes with three shots.
- Smoke Bombs. You can use a smoke bomb as part of the Hide action. You light the bomb, throw it to the ground at your feet, and it explodes in a flash, releasing a 10 -foot cube of colored smoke, which allows you to hide from creatures that could see you clearly before you used the smoke bomb. The smoke from the bomb lasts until the end of your next turn. Each smoke bomb costs 100 gp .
- Tanglefoot Bag. This bag is filled with a sticky adhesive. As an action, you can throw the bag up to 20 feet at a Large or smaller creature, where the bag breaks upon impact. Make a ranged attack roll against the creature. On a hit, the creature is restrained by the glue. A creature restrained this way can break free with a successful DC 10 Strength check made as an action. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the glue also frees the creature without harming it. A tanglefoot bag costs 50 gp .


## Crafting Equipment

The characters have slightly longer than usual to prepare for the job, so they can spend some time crafting specialist equipment. With a preparation action, a character can engage in one of the following crafts:

- Common or Uncommon Potion. Alama and Corvis can use their alchemist's supplies and herbalism kit to attempt to craft any common or uncommon rarity potion found on the Handout 10: Available Gear. Every attempt to create a potion costs 25 gp in supplies for a common potion and 50 gp for an uncommon one. A successful DC 13 Intelligence check with alchemist's supplies or an herbalism kit turns the supplies into the desired potion while a failure simply consumes the supplies. A character can craft as many potions as needed with a single preparation action.
- Disguises. Alama, Corvis, Mischief and Long Mei carry disguise kits and are proficient in their use. To create a disguise, they must spend 10 gp and make a Charisma (Deception) check with advantage. The check result is the DC required to see past the disguise with a Wisdom

---

(Insight) check. Any number of disguises can be made with a single preparation action.

- Identification/Invitations: Alama and Mischief carry forgery kits and are proficient in their use. To forge a document - for example, a false invitation to the party - they must spend 10 gp and make a Dexterity (Deception) check with advantage. The check result is the DC required to see past the forgery with a Wisdom (Insight) check. Any number of documents can be made with a single preparation action.
- Food. Caldra, Long Mei or Zashyda can use their brewer's supplies or cook's utensils to create a food item large enough to conceal a person (such as a large cake or a barrel of beer), 12 light weapons, six weapons that are neither heavy nor light, or three heavy weapons. Such an item requires 100 gp in supplies to make. A character can create as many objects as needed with a single preparation action.
- Modified Clothing. Alama or Zashyda can use their leatherworker's tools or weaver's tools to sew hidden pockets and straps into clothing, which allow a creature to conceal a larger weapon (see "Concealing Weapons"). Modifying an outfit to fit a Light weapon costs 25 gp in supplies. A character can modify as many outfits as needed with a single preparation action.
- Poison. Alama and Mischief can use their alchemist's supplies or a poisoner's kit to attempt to craft the poisons found on Handout 10: Available Gear. Every poison has a separate supply cost and creation DC, as shown on the "Crafting Poisons" table. A successful Intelligence check with alchemist's supplies or a poisoner's kit turns the supplies into the desired poison while a failure simply consumes the supplies. A character can craft as many poisons as needed with a single preparation action.


## Crafting Poisons

| Poison | Supply Cost | Creation DC |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Assassin's Blood | 75 gp | 12 |
| Carrion Crawler Mucus | 100 gp | 14 |
| Drow Poison | 100 gp | 14 |
| Serpent Venom | 100 gp | 14 |
| Truth Serum | 75 gp | 12 |

- Spell Scroll. Caldra or Long Mei can create a spell scroll of a spell they know by spending money on the proper inks and parchments, as shown on the "Crafting Spell Scrolls" table. If the spell has any material components that cost
money, add them to the cost of the scroll. A character can craft as many spell scrolls as needed with a single preparation action.


## Crafting Spell Scrolls

| Spell Level | Supply Cost |
| :-- | :-- |
| Cantrip | 10 gp |
| 1st | 25 gp |
| 2nd | 50 gp |

## Gathering Information

A character that takes this action can attempt a DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) check to learn one of the following pieces of information:
d6 Information
1 The security team have set up a base of operations in the mansion's study.
2 Lady Vocasca is a hoarder and keeps a mountain of trinkets and boxed goods in her attic.
3 The ballroom doors leading into the garden are usually left open during parties.
4 Grigrof Mug, the majordomo, is allergic to flour: it makes him sneeze uncontrollably.
5 The knight in charge of security, Stef Salindram, is blind in his left eye.
6 Lady Vocasca is known to have an attraction to half-elves.

## Hiring Help

A character that takes this action can hire the services of a single bandit for 20 gp , or up to three urchin commoners for 5 gp each. The player controls these characters for the duration of part 7.

## Scouting the Area

A character that takes this action must make a Wisdom (Perception) check. The result of this check determines the amount of information gleaned from casing the area:

- DC 10: There's a crack in the garden wall that's been covered by a pair of loose wooden boards.
- DC 12: A drainpipe runs from the rooftop gutters to the bushes in the back of the mansion.
- DC 14: There's a skylight on the roof of the building that leads into the attic.
- DC 16: The easiest way into the mansion may be through the privy windows, which are left open during parties.

---

Anyone taking this action must make a DC 10 Dexterity (Stealth) to avoid attracting the suspicion of the guards. If they're spotted, the group starts part 7 with a suspicion score of +50 (see "Suspicion" in part 7).

## Using a Background Feature

The following characters have background features that could apply to this part:

- Alama can uncover a hidden passage beneath the city that leads into the cellars of Vocasca Manor (area 6).
- Caldra can research the noble families of Waterdeep to create a convincing backstory for one of the characters disguised as a noble. This character has advantage on Charisma checks made to influence other nobles in part 7.
- Corvis can use his connections in the Temple of Ilmater to prepare an alternate holding cell at a nearby temple of Ilmater. The first time a character is imprisoned as a result of a Shout for the Constable! encounter in part 7, that character is taken to this temple (rather than the cellars) and then immediately let out by the monks who tend to the place.
- Long Mei can secure a personal invitation to the party by auditioning for Lady Vocasca to be part of the entertainment. He can go anywhere servants or nobles go without arousing suspicion.
- Mischief can use her status as a noble to get an invitation for herself and a friend to the party.
- Zashyda's criminal contact can inform her of the cover identity of any criminal agents at the party that the characters do not know of yet.


## DEVISING a Plan

Tell the characters that they must plan for the following challenges. If they finish this part early, immediately move on to "Montage!"

## Dress Appropriately

Characters must decide if they want to go to the party dressed as nobles, servants, or as their normal selves. Each character can choose a different option or not as they desire.

Noble finery. Characters who dress as nobles can wear armor as part of their costume, but they arouse suspicion if they're spotted anywhere in Vocasca Manor other than the main ballroom, garden, or reception hall. If a character chooses to enter as a noble, give them one of the paper fans provided in your DM pack!

Servants. Characters who dress as servants can't wear armor without arousing suspicion, but they're free to roam through the servant's quarters once they get inside.

Normal clothes. Characters who enter the party in normal clothes must find a way to get past the guards enforcing the dress code and arouse suspicion if they're seen anywhere other than the reception hall.

Concealed weapons. Anyone carrying a weapon is barred from entering the party, but a character can conceal one of the following weapons on their person without raising suspicion: dagger, dart, hand crossbow with 10 bolts, and a sling with 20 bullets. A character wearing modified clothing (see "Crafting Equipment") can add a second weapon to those concealed, so long as it has the light property.

## Make Fan Signals

Give each character a hand fan (the event organizers should have these). They, in addition to every guest, guard, and server, carry these fans at the Cynosure Ball.

Tell the characters they must come up with at least one signal all the players can do at the table that means "change the subject" and another that means "time to say goodbye." This way the characters can signal plans to each other while talking to NPCs without raising suspicion. The characters can come up with as many other hand signals to mean as many other secret messages as time allows.

## Get into the Party

The informant probably told the group that nobles are only allowed into the party if they have an invitation to show the guards. Characters hoping to get in the front door dressed in noble finery must have a plan to get an invitation or otherwise get past the guards.

The informant may also have told the characters that servants must enter the party through the servant's entrance. Guards at the garden entrance will be checking identification for all servants.

The characters could choose to break into the party another way (perhaps if they know about the attic skylight or the privy window) or plan to fight their way in (a terrible idea almost certain to result in the death of at least some characters).

## Get into the Private Auction

Once at the party, the characters must find a way to get into the private auction room. If they successfully questioned their informant, they'll

---

know they need special coins to enter the private auction, which they could win from Lady Vocasca or steal from nobles at the party.

# Get the Eye of Zaltec 

The characters also need to come up with a plan to steal the Eye of Zaltec. Though they don't know the specifics, the informant may have told them that the gem is held in the auction room, locked with a combination lock that only Lady Vocasca knows the passcode for, and attended by guards.

## Montage!

Once 35 minutes are up, the characters have 10 minutes to summarize the actions they took as a montage. Award inspiration for excellent descriptions.

## Time Remaining

If the characters finish their early, note how much time is left in this part of the adventure for scoring, and then move on. If the characters aren't done after 45 minutes in this part of the adventure, inform them they'll have to improvise, because it's time to get this party started!

## Scoring Part 6

Use the scoring sheet from Appendix B to tally the players' points. Scoring for Part 6 is calculated as follows:

Preparation Actions. Assign 50 points the players succeed on a preparation action.

Total Points: $\qquad$ $(0-300)$

Time Remaining. Assign 20 points for every minute remaining in this part when the players finish (maximum 15 mins).

Total Points: $\qquad$ $(0-300)$

TOTAL POINTS PART 6: $\qquad$ (600 max)

---

## Part 7. The Cynosure Ball

Time Limit: 2 hours.
The characters infiltrate Vocasca Manor to steal the Eye of Zaltec. Rival criminal factions are onsite with the same goal.

Fireworks crackle through the night, illuminating the face of Vocasca Manor with strobing pink and white lights. Tonight, the whole of Waterdeep seems to be on edge, as though the gods themselves were watching.

You now have 2 hours real-time to break into Vocasca Manor, infiltrate the private auction, and steal the Eye of Zaltec. Don't worry about lifting any other valuables - in this final part, it's all about the Eye of Zaltec. Good luck!

## ADAPTING TO THE GROUP'S PLAN

It's your job to bring the group's plan to dramatic conclusion. This requires you to think on your feet. Don't be a slave to the adventure text and be prepared to adlib events where necessary.

## AsSault

Assault is the players' least likely strategy, but it's a fallback if other plans go awry. With so many Masked Lords present, the hostess trusts in her security team to deal with problems before calling in the City Watch. If an alarm is raised, her guards rush to the area and then surreptitiously patrol the site for the remainder of the event. Any captives are locked up in the cellars (area 6) for questioning after the auction.

## DECEPTION

Characters with fake invitations can enter as nobles. All guests are masked and dressed in expensive finery: if a character appears uncouth or ill-attired, they'll accrue suspicion (see "Suspicion"). Other means of deception include posing as guild inspectors, catering suppliers, servants, or entertainers. Majordomo Grigrof Mug (area 3) keeps an accurate record of his contractors, but players with a convincing story should be able to fast-talk their way past security with a DC 12 Charisma (Deception) check. The guards all wear red tabards emblazoned with the Vocasca coat of arms: if a character has one of these they could pose as a guard (other guards have a $35 \%$ chance of getting suspicious when seeing them up close as described in "Suspicion").

## Stealth

There are many ways to sneak inside: entering through the attic skylight, scaling a drainpipe, or even smuggling people in with a delivery. Getting inside is the easy bit though: stealing the Eye of Zaltec without a cover story or disguise is almost impossible. Thankfully, there are plenty of opportunities to acquire disguises once inside.

## Diversion

Releasing smoke bombs into the crowds or starting fires are both good plans. Guests panic, and guards rush blindly to investigate. Triggering an evacuation is almost impossible though: Lady Vocasca has waited all year to host this event and won't allow her security team to evacuate the premises unless the building is literally collapsing around them.

## Rival Factions

Each of the criminal factions already has agent on site. These rivals are perfect for adding complications. For example, if your players bypass Lady Vocasca by disguising themselves as waiters, you could have the Bregan D'aerthe agent poison one of the drinks they're carrying to take out a rival noble.

Bregan D'aerthe. The Bregan D'aerthe drow gunslinger named Ulzo'no Braxt'l wears a hat of disguise to appear as the Amnian Prince Kiro Coldtide. He's currently in the ballroom.

Xanathar Guild. The Xanathar Guild agent is an orog onsite in the kitchens, posing as a cook called Masol Ketsk.

Cassalanters. The Cassalanter cult fanatic is posing as a guard called Kalreve Nobleglide. She's currently patrolling Vocasca's Quarters.

Zhentarim. The Zhentarim bandit captain is present as the human noble Lady Livi Mosse, a legitimate dignitary of Waterdeep. She's currently in the garden, on the patio just outside the ballroom.

If the players agreed to sell the Eye of Zaltec to their informant's boss, that faction's agent tries to contact the characters during the evening. See the room descriptions for more information.

If the players refused to sell the Eye of Zaltec to their informant, he or she has betrayed them to the rival agents. The rival factions are on the lookout for them, but don't want to blow their own cover by attacking them unless necessary. See the room descriptions for more information.

## SusPiciON

As the characters move through the site, they run the risk of drawing suspicion. To avoid a single

---

failed ability check blowing their cover, use the following rules within the mansion.

- Whenever a character fails an important check or performs an action that seems suspicious, ask the player to roll a d100 and add the result to the group's ongoing suspicion score. This score starts at zero.
- If the group's current suspicion score exceeds the suspicion threshold of 500, any failed checks from this point result in alarms being raised in the character's locations: Shout for a Constable!
- If the group's current suspicion score is less than the suspicion threshold, the NPC in question brushes the suspicious action off as a false alarm. For example, a guard on patrol shrugs and blames the odd noise on rats, or a NPC accepts a hokey cover story.
- If a character performs an action that cleverly allays suspicion, ask them to roll a d100 and remove the result from the group ongoing suspicion score.


## Vocasca Manor layout

The Vocasca Manor map shows the layout of the building. The characters also have Handout 8, an incomplete map that paints the layout in broad strokes. The areas detailed below correspond to locations shown on your map.

## Features of Vocasca Manor

Lady Vocasca's home is a stately manor in the Castle Ward. Walls are crafted from worked stone clad in lacquered wood, with polished floorboards throughout. Hundreds of guests are present.

Dimensions. Each square on the map represents 10 feet. Ceilings are 25 feet high in corridors and rooms.

Doors. Doors are made from paneled wood and are locked where shown on the map. The security guards carry house keys, as does the majordomo, Grigrof Mug (area 3). Picking a lock requires success on a DC 12 Dexterity check made with thieves' tools.

Lighting. For the Cynosure Ball, Lady Vocasca has fitted her lanterns with rosy pink glass. This dims their radiance and creates areas of shadowy light where shown on the map. In these areas, Dexterity (Stealth) checks are made with advantage against creatures without darkvision.

Sounds and Smells. Music and conversation drifts from the ballroom and reception hall. Within those areas, it's almost deafening.

## Area 1: Main Entrance

The street outside Vocasca Manor heaves with revelers. A line of finely dressed, masked nobles winds up the steps to the front door, where armed guards are checking invitations. Stone walls enclose a garden to the rear of the building.

Ten guards man the main entrance, supervised by the sneering guard veteran Guidos Seabone. Guests are refused entry if they can't present an invitation. Most guests are dropped off by carriage outside the entrance, but some arrive on foot and could potentially be waylaid on approach. Guests on foot arrive in groups of 1 d 4 nobles and are always accompanied by a veteran bodyguard. Any character who attempts to pickpocket a noble for their ticket must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check.

## Area 2: Walled Garden

Muffled music drifts over this walled garden. It's dark down here, but exploding fireworks occasionally throw the lawns into sudden, stark detail. A pair of guards stroll around on patrol, carrying a single lantern between them. At the base of the auction house, curved steps ascend to the ballroom doors. A plain door near the base of the steps enters the servant's quarters.

Two guards patrol the garden, with a guard veteran standing watch on the street outside the rear gate. The walls surrounding the garden are 10 feet high. Servants occasionally pass through the garden, ferrying deliveries from the rear gate to the servant's quarters (area 5).

The garden has plenty of hiding places, meaning checks made to hide here have advantage unless the intruder is illuminated by a flash of fireworks. Whenever a character needs to make a Dexterity (Stealth) check, ask them to roll a die beforehand: on an odd result, the fireworks flash just as they move.

Ballroom doors. The doors into the ballroom are open, and guests are milling about on the patio. Anyone not dressed in noble finery or as a waiter arouses suspicion if seen here. The Zhentarim agent Lady Livi Mosse (a bandit captain) is out here with her servants, Brazov and Gladon (spies), spying on Lady Vocasca (see the "Zhentarim Agent" sidebar).

Crack in wall. A narrow crack in the wall on the western side of the garden has been crudely

---

repaired with a pair of planks. If a character scouts the alley here, they spot the crack on a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check. Any character can squeeze through the crack.

Drainpipe. A drainpipe at the rear of the mansion ascends to the eaves of the roof. Climbing the drainpipe requires success on a DC 8 Strength (Athletics) check.

## ZHENTARIM AGENT

Lady Livi Mosse (LE female Illuskan human bandit captain) works for Manshoon's Zhentarim. At all times she is tended by two human footmen named Barzov and Gladon (disguised Zhentarim spies). The middle-aged woman is disguised as a noble enjoying a drink, waiting to hear what Lady Vocasca has to say about the Eye of Zaltec. Livi has no sense of humor and wears a cold face at all times. She enjoys the finer things in life and looks down on everyone else as inferior.

If the characters made a deal with Manshoon's Zhentarim in part 5, Livi waits for a private moment and reveals her identity as an agent of Manshoon. She offers to help the characters however she can without blowing her cover. Livi is willing to create distractions and can enlist the help of Barzov and Gladon in that task.

If the characters refused a deal in part 5 with any faction or if they have exceeded the suspicion threshold (see "Suspicion"), she feigns interest in them and has Barzov and Gladon bring them wine laced with poison. A successful Wisdom (Insight) check opposed by Livi's Charisma (Deception) check reveals she is hiding something. Characters that drink the wine must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 hour (likely until the end of the adventure). A character who examines the wine and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence check with alchemist's supplies can tell the wine is poisoned. Alama has advantage on this check. After the characters drink the wine, the Zhentarim shadow them through the party at a distance. A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check notices them following. If the characters wander into a place without guards, the Zhentarim attack and fight until one of them falls or guards arrive.

If Livi, Barzov, and Gladon are still at the party and the alarm goes off, they arrive to help or hinder the characters (see "The Escape").

## Area 3: ReCeption Hall

Dozens of costumed guests mill about this reception hall, laughing, chatting, and nibbling on canapes dished out by waiters dressed as masked angels. A staircase sweeps up to the ballroom. On either side of the stairs, doors marked "Private" open into the wings of the manor. A door to the east looks like it leads into the bathrooms.

Roughly one hundred nobles are gathered here, attended by fifteen commoner waiters. Two guards stand watch outside each private door. On the grand staircase, the house majordomo Grigrof Mug observes the proceedings with a hawkish eye (see "Roleplaying Grigrof Mug," below).

Rumors. Characters who mingle with the guests overhear the following rumors.

- "There's something off about Prince Coldtide. I just saw him dancing in the ballroom. Does anyone actually know him?"
- "Lady Vocasca is famous for not having an original thought in her head. How did she dream this wonderful event up?"


## Roleplaying Grigrof Mug

Grigrof is a wiry man in his late 40s, dressed in a neat brown suit with a powdered wig. He carries a ledger detailing staff rosters, catering contracts, and other employment matters. Grigrof avoids contact with guests except to handle complaints, concerning himself instead with supervising staff. He is allergic to flour, and the slightest whiff of it sends him into fits of sneezing. Use Grigrof to pester characters disguised as servants or outside contractors. Grigrof is a commoner with Wisdom 14 and an Insight bonus of +4 .

## Area 4: PrIVies

This chamber serves as a privy, with separate stalls for toilets. Guests who wish to relieve themselves quickly can do so in one of the screened-off chamber pots.

There are usually between five and ten nobles in the privies.

Privy windows. A few of the stalls have windows in the walls, which are left open during the party. There's a $25 \%$ chance that a stall is occupied if a character climbs through from outside.

## Area 5: Servant's Quarters

The kitchens are steamy, noisy, and chock full of servants. Sweaty cooks toil over the ovens and man the chopping boards, attending to a never-ending parade of waiting staff. Adjoining rooms are home to pantries, a cold-room for meat, and a washroom.

This area is impossible to sneak through, but its general busyness makes deception easy. Checks made to trick or deceive the staff in here are made

---

with advantage (most of them are under pressure to get service out and couldn't care less who walks past). Tonight, there are fifty human commoner staff on duty. Twenty of them operate as waiters. Most of them have been contracted for the night, so they don't know each other well. A Xanathar Guild agent named Masol Ketsk is onsite in the kitchens, posing as a cook (see the "Xanathar Guild Agent" sidebar below).

Waiting staff costumes. The serving staff are dressed as angels, with feathered strap-on wings, silken tunics, and blank full-face masks. Three spare costumes are laid out in the washroom.

## XANATHAR GUILD AGENT

Masol Ketsk is an orog who works for the Xanathar Guild. Currently Masol is disguised as a cook working in the kitchen. The hulking orog is missing a tusk and truly does have a passion for cooking and food. Given the chance, Masol steers any conversation toward the subject. She keeps a large covered pot nearby at all times that hides a swarm of poisonous snakes she trained to attack.

If the characters made a deal with the Xanathar Guild in part 5, Masol waits for a private moment and reveals her identity as an Agent of the Eye. She offers to help the characters however she can without blowing her cover. She is willing to poison food (if the characters have poison) or create a distraction (possibly using her snakes).

If the characters refused a deal in part 5 with any faction or if they have exceeded the suspicion threshold (see "Suspicion"), Masol asks the characters to help her carry her heavy pot to the guard room in area 8 , so the guards can have stew. A successful DC 12 Wisdom (Insight) check reveals Masol is leading the characters into a trap. When they arrive in the guard room, Masol kicks over the pot of snakes, blames it on the characters, and attacks the party, hoping to bring the guards in the room to her side. If the characters argue against her, have them make an opposed Charisma (Persuasion) check against Masol's Charisma (Intimidation) check. The guards side with whoever is successful, siding with Masol on a tie.

If Masol is still at the party and the alarm goes off, she grabs her pot of snakes and arrives to help or hinder the characters (see "The Escape").

## Area 6: Cellars

A lantern on the wall casts flickering light over this cellar. Huge wine casks stand sentinel in the gloom, set back into arched recesses. A large iron cage rests on the floor at the rear of the cellar.

Waiters infrequently visit this area when they need to refill wine kegs for the kitchens. Stef Salindram (area 7) imprisons intruders in the cage
if they're caught onsite. A tipsy guard is stationed here to ensures nobody meddles with the lock. The cage is padlocked but can be picked with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check made with thieves' tools.

Characters who arrested during this part of the adventure in a Shout for the Constable! encounter are held in the cage here instead of being removed from the scene.

## Area 7: Lady Vocasca's Quarters

This wood-paneled corridor connects a set of opulently furnished living chambers. Paintings on the wall depict an ancient line of stern, Waterdhavian nobility. From somewhere nearby, a lone harpist plays a haunting melody.

The music drifting through this area is conjured magically, but players needn't know this!

Guard on patrol. A single guard called Kalreve Nobleglide patrols this area. She is in fact a cult fanatic working for the Cassalanter noble family (see the "Cassalanter Agent" sidebar below).

Secret Information. Characters who search these rooms learn the following piece of information from a letter hidden in desk drawer.

- "Be cautious around Lady Livi Mosse. She's invited to your party, and we believe she's an agent of the Zhentarim."
Wardrobes. Searching the wardrobes uncovers extravagant noble costumes for four characters, including masks and fans. If a character dresses in noble finery, give them one of the paper fans from your DM kit.


## Cassalanter Agent

Kalreve Nobleglide (LE female Illuskan human cult fanatic) is loyal to the Cassalanters and the cult of Asmodeus. The twenty-something woman speaks quickly, laughs at anything, and takes pleasure in cruelty. She wears a magic crystal necklace. If she breaks the necklace as an action, she summons a bearded devil who acts as Kalreve's bound servant. If anyone else breaks the necklace, the bearded devil is still bound to Kalreve and only does her bidding.

If the characters made a deal with the Cassalanters in part 5, Kalreve waits for a private moment and reveals her identity as a friend of the Cassalanters. She offers to help the characters however she can without blowing her cover. She is willing to act as a guard and escort them into restricted areas (though she does not carry a token for the auction room) and to create a distraction.

If the characters refused a deal in part 5 with any faction or if they have exceeded the suspicion threshold (see "Suspicion"), she locks tries to lock the characters in Lady

---

Vocasca's bedroom with her bearded devil, who attacks. If the characters make it out of the room alive, she then shouts for help, and two veterans from area 8 come to her aid. Kalreve tries to slip away and hide in the privies while the guards question the characters.

If Kalreve is still at the party and the alarm goes off, she summons her devil and arrives to help or hinder the characters (see "The Escape").

## Area 8: Guard Room

This wood-paneled room was once a study but has been turned over for use as a guard room. A map of the mansion is pinned to an easel, penned with guard positions and handwritten notations. More parchments are scattered over a heavy wooden desk: guard rosters, guest lists, and inventories.

Two guard veterans are present here, talking through the rosters with the knight in charge of security, Stef Salindram. Stef is entirely blind in his left eye.

Map. If the characters study the map on the easel, fill in Handout 8 with any information shown on the Vocasca Manor map. The guard rosters, guest lists, and inventories contain information on everyone present tonight: if the players use these to aid their plans, grant them advantage on any pertinent checks.

Secret information. Characters who search through the papers learn the following piece of information:

- "We believe one of the cooks, Masol Ketsk, may have links to the Xanathar Guild. His story checks out for now, but let's keep an eye on him."


## Area 9: Ballroom

Thousands of pink and white rose petals drift from the ceiling to rain over the Cynosure Ball. Laugher and music fill the air, wine flows like water, and drunken guests cavort through the masked crowd. To the side of the hall, armored guards flank a set of double doors. Doors at the rear of the ballroom open into the gardens.

Only guests, waiters, and guards are allowed inside the ballroom. In total, four hundred noble guests are present here, watched over by twenty guards.

If a character enters here dressed as a noble, read:

A majestic woman dressed in a flowing pink and white dress swirls from the crowd. She extends her hand toward you and laughs. Judging by the looks you're getting from other guests, she's clearly important.
"Welcome to my party, darlings! Can you guess who I am? No, I simply can't stand it! I'm Lady Vocasca! Come! Let us talk!"

If the character agrees to talk to her, Lady Vocasca proposes a fun game to grant them entry to the private auction (see the "Lady Voscasca's Game").

Note also that Lady Vocasca is the only person here that knows the password for the strongbox containing the Eye of Zaltec. She won't reveal this unless charmed or drugged. The password is "password." Vocasca has a thing for half-elves, so Corvis gains advantage on all Charisma checks made to manipulate her. She has disadvantage on any saving throws to resist charm effects from half-elves.

Dancing guests. Guests cram the ballroom floor, either standing about talking, or swirling past dancing. The entire room counts as difficult terrain, and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight or hearing are made with disadvantage.

Auction room entrance. A hired wizard, Falco Theros, stands sentinel outside the auction room, flanked by two guards. Falco has the statistics of a mage with the following modifications:

- Falco has see invisibility prepared instead of suggestion.
- Falco has already spent one of his $2^{\text {nd }}$ level slots to cast see invisibility. Every hour, he spends another slot to recast the spell.
To enter the auction room, guests must present their rune-marked coin to Falco. If Lady Vocasca has enabled the rune, he allows them entry.


## BRegan D'aerthe Agent

Ulzo'no Braxt'l is a Bregan D'aerthe drow gunslinger masquerading as the human Amnian Prince Kiro Coldtide thanks to his hat of disguise. Ulzo'no is tended to by four masked drow guards, who have every inch of skin covered by elaborate angel costumes.

If the characters made a deal with Bregan D'aerthe in part 5, Ulzo'no waits for a private moment and reveals his identity as an agent of Bregan D'aerthe. He offers to help the characters however he can without blowing his cover. He shares the location and names of the other criminal agents and is willing to create a distraction.

If the characters refused a deal in part 5 with any faction or if they have exceeded the suspicion threshold (see

---

"Suspicion"), he encourages them to dance with him. While the characters dance, Ulzo'no uses a special ring to attempt to poison them. As he passes by a character, he can touch them with his ring by making a melee attack roll with a +6 bonus. If he hits, the character takes 1 piercing damage and must save against the ring's drow poison (see the "Drow Poison" sidebar).

A character that falls asleep due to this poison is considered drunk by the guards and taken to the cage in area 6 to be dealt with after the party ends. The guards poke the character awake once secure in the cage.

If Ulzo'no is still at the party and the alarm goes off, he gathers the other drow and arrives to help or hinder the characters (see "The Escape").

## Drow PoISON

A creature subjected to drow poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour (likely until the end of this adventure). If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is also unconscious while poisoned in this way. The creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake.

## Area 10: Auction Room

This area is off limits to everyone apart from guards and guests who carry the correct token: a gold coin marked with a magic rune. Read the following when the players enter:

This hall is lit by low-burning lanterns and thick with the smell of incense and perfume. A private bar runs the length of the far wall, and a semicircle of chairs is arranged around a large box covered in red drapes sitting in the middle of the floor. Masked guests mill around the room, muttering to each other.

There are three veterans standing guard next to the box. In total, there are thirty noble guests in here. Once inside, guests can mingle freely between their seats and the bar, but the guards shoo them away from the covered box containing the Eye of Zaltec.

Auction. The auction begins at "ten bells." When a character first enters the auction room, tell the players that they have fifteen minutes real-time (or until the end of the event) before the auction ends and their mission fails. During this time, a character can drag out proceedings by getting into a bidding war for the gem. Each success on a DC 12 Charisma (Deception) check buys the group another five minutes, with failures gaining suspicion. If the players fail to steal the Eye of Zaltec within time, the gem is stolen by a rival faction (see the "Grand Melee").

The Eye of Zaltec. See "Stealing the Eye" for details on how players can steal the Eye of Zaltec.

## Area 11: Attic

A moonbeam falls from the skylight into a yawning attic space. Packing crates, shipping chests and old furniture are haphazardly squared away under tarpaulins.

Nobody comes up here. It's silent and safe to explore.

Strongbox receipt. If a character searches the chests, they find a crumpled receipt stuffed in an empty packaging crate. A message is written on the receipt:
"My lady Vocasca, I hope you received this combination safe intact. Do try to think of something original for the password: i.e. not your own name!"

Crates. Searching the crates uncovers extravagant noble costumes for six characters, including masks and fans. If a character dresses in noble finery, give them one of the paper fans from your DM kit.

## LADY Vocasca's GAME

Lady Vocasca offers characters dressed in noble finery an opportunity to win a coin for the private auction. When she pulls one or more of these characters aside, she reveals the following information:

- Lady Vocasca gives one of the characters a special coin for the private auction. Give the player an actual coin. As you pass it over, use your paper fan to hide it from view as best as possible.
- Lady Vocasca says the coin admits up to six guests to the private auction. However, it won't work until she activates the rune. This is true.
- Lady Vocasca says she'll be keeping an eye on the character for the next ten minutes. If they can slip the coin to one of their companions without her noticing, they can keep the coin. If she can tell who's got it, she'll take it back!
Now explain the following out-of-character:
- The players must hide the coin from you, so you can't guess who's got it after ten minutes. Players can use the paper fans to hide the coin from view as they pass it around.

---

- Play continues as normal. The player's goal is to pass the coin among themselves until you can't tell who's got it.
- Players must adhere to the following rules:


## 1. A player can only pass the coin to another player whose character is present.

2. The coin must always be held by a player.
3. The coin must remain above the level of the table.
4. The coin must remain at the table.

After ten minutes, Vocasca seeks out the characters and you must guess who has the coin. If you guess incorrectly, Vocasca activates the rune and the players can use it to enter the auction. If you guess correctly, Vocasca takes the coin back.

## Stealing the Eye

The box containing the Eye of Zaltec is kept on a pedestal under red drapes. It appears as a two-foot-cubic adamantine case with a single, handsized opening in one of its vertical sides. The faces of the box are solid crystal, offering a view of the gem within, Guards watch the box continually, but obviously can't see under the drapes. If a character looks under the drapes, read:

A two-foot-cubic adamantine box rests on the pedestal. The faces of the box are solid crystal, offering a view of the gem within. The Eye of Zaltec is a fist-sized glowing ruby held aloft by an adamantine claw protruding from the box's base. Orbiting the claw's wrist is a letter dial with an eightdigit numbered combination lock set into its center. On the letter dial, each letter of the alphabet corresponds to a number from one to nine. A hand-sized opening is set into the back side of the box, allowing you to reach inside and manipulate the dial.

## Solving the Puzzle Lock

If the players know the correct passcode ("password"), they can read the letter dial to extract the following combination: "71115694". When this code is entered in the combination lock, the claw releases the Eye of Zaltec. When the players have the gem, proceed to "The Escape." Forcing the gem from the claw requires success on a DC 15 Strength check and sets off a shrieking alarm (see "The Escape").

## The Escape

Soon after the characters steal the Eye of Zaltec, all hell breaks loose.

## No Alarm

Soon after they acquire the gem, Lady Vocasca calls the auction to a close and pulls the drapes on the box. Read:

Gasps erupt from the crowd as the drapes are pulled back. The box lies open and the Eye of Zaltec is gone! Lady
Vosasca shrieks.
"Treachery! The Eye of Zaltec has been stolen! Lock the doors! Call the City Watch! We'll not leave this hall until the culprits have been identified!"

Confusion spreads over the auction house as word breaks that the Eye of Zaltec has been stolen. Ask each player to describe how they escape the auction house. Make it clear to the players that this is not combat, so no dice need to be rolled. They can narrate exactly how they escape the manor in the coolest way possible.

## The Alarm

If the alarm on the box is triggered, read:

The box begins shrieking like a banshee, a strangled wail that alerts all the guards in the room. Lady Vocasca squeals in shock.
"Stop! Thieves!"

The players are attacked by any guard veterans still present. Each round thereafter, the following enemies appear and attempt to take the gem from the characters:

- At the start of the second round of combat, Lady Livi Mosse (a bandit captain), Barzov, and Gladon (both spies) appear (see the "Zhentarim Agent" sidebar).
- At the start of the third round of combat, Ulzo'no Braxt'l, the drow gunslinger, and his four drow companions appear (see the "Bregan D'aerthe Agent" sidebar).
- At the start of the fourth round of combat, Masol Ketsk, the orog, appears with her swarm of poisonous snakes (see the "Xanathar Guild Agent" sidebar).
- At the start of the fifth round of combat, Kalreve Nobleglide, the cult fanatic, appears with her bearded devil (see the "Cassalanter Agent" sidebar).

---

- At the start of every round of combat after the fifth, two guards appear.
If the players escape alive with the gem, they've completed the adventure!

Allied agent. If the players agreed to their informant's deal, their allied agent tries to aid their escape (assuming they're still alive). This allied agent appears at the start of the second round of combat instead of whenever they normally would.

## Timeout

If the players run out of time, Lady Vocasca calls the auction to a close and pulls the drapes on the box. Read:

Gasps erupt from the crowd as the drapes are pulled back. The box lies open and the Eye of Zaltec is gone! Lady Vosasca shrieks.
"Treachery! The Eye of Zaltec has been stolen! Lock the doors! Call the City Watch! We'll not leave this hall until the culprits have been identified!"

Alas, enemy agents have stolen the Eye of Zaltec. The players have failed in their mission.

# Waterdeep Welcomes a Night of Revels! 

Lliira's Night is soon upon us! Across the city, preparations are in full swing for a grand night of revels, with dancehalls, inns and taverns expecting sell-out crowds. The grandest party of all is sure to be the Cynosure Ball, hosted by Lady Vocasca at her manor in the Castle Ward, and expected to draw many masked lords. Last year, her ladyship treated her guests to the opening of a pie containing five hundred live canaries. What wonders does she have in mind for this year? With the population of the city expected to swell overnight, the City Watch promise severe punishment for those who dishonor the goddess with crimes of violence.

## Sing a Song of Sixpence!

As Lliira's Night approaches, inns across the city are keen to audition entertainers for the night, with minstrels, jugglers and acrobats in particularly high demand. Even the Sea Ward's exclusive private inns are said to be opening their doors to entertainers in the run up to the festival!

## Street Laborer Strike Continues

City wide protests have begun against the ongoing strike by the Loyal Order of Street Laborers. Members of the Fellowship of Carters and Coachmen have called on the Guild of Stonecutters, Masons, Potters and Tile Makers to break the picket lines and attend to the growing pot-hole problem, which has seen cart wheels wrecked with alarming regularity since the strike began. Among the worse streets affected are Artillery Road in the South Ward, Grandmarket Boulevard in the Castle Ward, and Tin Dragon Alley in the Dock Ward.

## Crackdown on CultisM

The City Watch today announced a crackdown on devil and demon worship within the city. Extra watchmen have been drafted in to conduct raids of condemned houses, sewers, and crypts within the city, which are known to be common hideouts for such accursed folk. Of course, Waterdeep's gangs have been known to masquerade as City Watch, so this newspaper warns residents to always check for official identification before opening one's door to the law.

## Hang-Gliders Stolen by ZHENTS!

Three flying machines brought to Waterdeep by the famed inventor Khaled bin Zafir have been stolen in a brazen highway robbery in the South Ward. The culprits behind the theft are thought to be the Zhentarim, whose ongoing street war with thugs of the Xanathar Guild has caused chaos across the city this summer. Authorities are worried that the thugs could be planning to use the gliders to infiltrate noble residences from the rooftops.

You each can take one preparation action.
Refer to this sheet if you use your action to buy or craft equipment,

## Buying EQUIPMENT

A character that takes this action can buy any equipment listed in chapter 5 of the Player's Handbook. In addition, the following special gear is available:

- Grappling Hook Gun. This modified heavy crossbow shoots a grappling hook and 50 feet of rope up to 50 feet. As a ranged attack action you can shoot the grapnel and rope and then (assuming you hit) press another button to reel in an unattended object you hit with it. Reloading the crossbow with a new rope and grapnel requires an action. The crossbow fires bolts normally. Each grappling hook gun costs 150 gp and comes with three shots.
- Smoke Bomb. You can use a smoke bomb as part of the Hide action. You light the bomb, throw it to the ground at your feet, and it explodes in a flash, releasing a 10 -foot cube of colored smoke, which allows you to hide from creatures that could see you clearly before you used the smoke bomb. The smoke from the bomb lasts until the end of your next turn. Each smoke bomb costs 100 gp .
- Tanglefoot Bag. This bag is filled with a sticky adhesive. As an action, you can throw the bag up to 20 feet at a Large or smaller creature, where the bag breaks upon impact. Make a ranged attack roll against the creature. On a hit, the creature is restrained by the glue. A creature restrained this way can break free with a successful DC 10 Strength check made as an action. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the glue also frees the creature without harming it. A tanglefoot bag costs 50 gp .


## Crafting Equipment

The characters have slightly longer than usual to prepare for the job, so they can spend some time crafting specialist equipment. With a preparation action, a character can engage in one of the following crafts:

- Common or Uncommon Potion. Alama and Corvis can use their alchemist's supplies and herbalism kit to attempt to craft any common or uncommon rarity potion listed below under "Potions". Every attempt to create a potion costs 25 gp in supplies for a common potion and 50
gp for an uncommon one. A successful DC 13 Intelligence check with alchemist's supplies or an herbalism kit turns the supplies into the desired potion while a failure simply consumes the supplies. A character can craft as many potions as needed with a single preparation action.
- Disguises. Alama, Corvis, Mischief and Long Mei carry disguise kits and are proficient in their use. To create a disguise, they must spend 10 gp and make a Charisma (Deception) check with advantage. The check result is the DC required to see past the disguise with a Wisdom (Insight) check. Any number of disguises can be made with a single preparation action.
- Identification/Invitations: Alama and Mischief carry forgery kits and are proficient in their use. To forge a document - for example, a false invitation to the party - they must spend 10 gp and make a Dexterity (Deception) check with advantage. The check result is the DC required to see past the forgery with a Wisdom (Insight) check. Any number of documents can be made with a single preparation action.
- Food. Caldra, Long Mei or Zashyda can use their brewer's supplies or cook's utensils to create a food item large enough to conceal a person (such as a large cake or a barrel of beer), 12 light weapons, six weapons that are neither heavy nor light, or three heavy weapons. Such an item requires 100 gp in supplies to make. A character can create as many objects as needed with a single preparation action.
- Modified Clothing. Alama or Zashyda can use their leatherworker's tools or weaver's tools to sew hidden pockets and straps into clothing, which allow a creature to conceal an additional weapon (see "Concealing Weapons"). Modifying an outfit to fit a Light weapon costs 25 gp in supplies. A character can modify as many outfits as needed with a single preparation action.
- Poison. Alama and Mischief can use their alchemist's supplies or a poisoner's kit to attempt to craft the poisons listed below under "Poisons". Every poison has a separate supply cost and creation DC, as shown on the "Crafting Poisons" table. A successful Intelligence check with alchemist's supplies or a poisoner's kit turns the supplies into the desired poison while a failure simply consumes the supplies. A character can craft as many poisons as needed with a single preparation action.

---

## Crafting Poisons

| Poison | Supply Cost | Creation DC |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Assassin's Blood | 75 gp | 12 |

| Drow Poison | 100 gp | 14 |
| Serpent Venom | 100 gp | 14 |
| Truth Serum | 75 gp | 12 |

- Spell Scroll. Caldra or Long Mei can create a spell scroll of a spell they know by spending money on the proper inks and parchments, as shown on the "Crafting Spell Scrolls" table. If the spell has any material components that cost money, add them to the cost of the scroll. A character can craft as many spell scrolls as needed with a single preparation action.


## Crafting Spell Scrolls

| Spell Level | Supply Cost |
| :-- | :-- |
| Cantrip | 10 gp |
| 1st | 25 gp |
| 2nd | 50 gp |

## Poisons

The poisons you can create have the following effects.

## Assassin's Blood

A creature subjected to this poison must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 6 (1d12) poison damage and is poisoned for 24 hours. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and isn't poisoned.

## Carrion Crawler Mucus

A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. The poisoned creature is paralyzed. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

## Serpent Venom

A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Truth Serum

A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 hour. The poisoned creature can't
knowingly speak a lie, as if under the effect of a zone of truth spell.

## Potions

The potions you can create can have the following effects.

## Oil of Slipperiness

## Potion, uncommon

The oil can cover a Medium or smaller creature, along with the equipment it's wearing and carrying (one additional vial is required for each size category above Medium). Applying the oil takes 10 minutes. The affected creature then gains the effect of a freedom of movement spell for 8 hours.

Alternatively, the oil can be poured on the ground as an action, where it covers a 10 -foot square, duplicating the effect of the grease spell in that area for 8 hours.

## Philter of Love

## Potion, uncommon

The next time you see a creature within 10 minutes after drinking this philter, you become charmed by that creature for 1 hour. If the creature is of a species and gender you are normally attracted to, you regard it as your true love while you are charmed. This potion's rosehued, effervescent liquid contains one easy-tomiss bubble shaped like a heart.

## Potion of Climbing

## Potion, common

When you drink this potion, you gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed for 1 hour. During this time, you have advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks you make to climb.

## Potion of Fire Breath

## Potion, uncommon

After you drink this potion, you can use a bonus action to exhale fire at a target within 30 feet of you. The target must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The effect ends after you exhale the fire three times or when 1 hour has passed.

## Potion of Greater Healing

## Potion, uncommon

You regain $4 \mathrm{~d} 4+4$ hit points when you drink this potion.

---

# Ротion of Growth 

## Potion, uncommon

When you drink this potion, you gain the "enlarge" effect of the enlarge/reduce spell for 1d4 hours (no concentration required).

## Ротion of Healing

## Potion, common

You regain $2 \mathrm{~d} 4+2$ hit points when you drink this potion.

## Ротion of Hill Giant Strength

## Potion, uncommon

When you drink this potion, your Strength score becomes 21 for 1 hour. The potion has no effect on you if your Strength is equal to or greater than 21.

## Ротion of Poison

## Potion, uncommon

This concoction looks, smells, and tastes like a potion of healing or other beneficial potion. However, it is actually poison masked by illusion magic. An identify spell reveals its true nature.

If you drink it, you take 3d6 poison damage, and you must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned. At the start of each of your turns while you are poisoned in this way, you take 3d6 poison damage. At the end of each of your turns, you can repeat the saving throw. On a successful save, the poison damage you take on your subsequent turns decreases by 1d6. The poison ends when the damage decreases to 0 .
