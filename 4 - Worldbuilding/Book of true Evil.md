# WARNING: MATURE CONTENT (18+) 

This book contains disturbing, macabre, explicitly violent, gruesome content and themes that may not be suitable for younger gamers. While we implore everyone to one day delve into our deliciously vile tome, it is not recommended for readers under 18 years of age without explicit parental consent.

Even so, all GMs should engage in a conversation of consent with players (see pages 127-128 in the Evil Gamemastering chapter) and roleplay of wickedness should be encouraged-not long, overdrawn, repeated depictions of torturing NPCs in monologues that drawl on for 10 minute intervals, but roleplay between villainous adventurers and NPCs (with a fair bit of torturing organized, rolled out as per the rules on page 11, and summarized unless it is a particularly important scene or point in the plot). Though the world contained inside of the glorious pages that follow is named Askis, play within it is meant to be brutal, serious, and far grander than a bit of storytelling sadism.

## FOREWORD

## (FROM THE BOOK OF EXALTED DARKNESS)

Whether you are one of our Kickstarter backers or someone who purchased this tome of evil, thank you for picking up Book of Exalted Darkness. This is my fifth and definitely most complicated campaign setting, and I am immensely proud of the work that people put into it. First and foremost among these is the featured artist: Indi Martin. As you can clearly see from the cover she is demonically talented, and she went above and beyond the pale with every one of her (many) commissions in the following pages. There's also the design crew-Savannah Broadway, James Introcaso, Luis Loza, and Michael McCarthy-who are all fiendish, devilishly-minded folk. Savannah and James killed it with the spells (her Heresy Knight archetype is sublime, and his relics! So evil!), Luis took on probably the most difficult individual item inside of this massive conglomeration of despicable gaming (the brilliant Dark Transformation prestige class), and my Canadian counterpart was, as always, consummate in his considerations of how to make the great works of the Celestial Heroes into fullyconceptualized obstacles for villainous adventurers to conquer. Most of all however, is my gratitude for the Kickstarter backers that funded all the artwork and words within.

Let's talk about evil. I have a deep and abiding love for roleplaying vile, despicable characters. They're downright memorable! I've reminisced upon my antithetical cannibal drow barbarian and all of his blasphemous accolades countless times. Ironically the focus on dark elves (which are way past due for getting the axe) is one of my central problems with evil in traditional roleplaying games so if you're here for spider matriarchs we're not able to accomodate (though by all means, there's space in the Taenarius Tunnels for GMs that insist on an arachnid drow mad scientist or whatever else they fancy). What we were aiming at with $B E D$ (let's all call it that) is not your parent's $\mathrm{D} \& \mathrm{D}$ evil-we encourage PCs to commit acts of wanton violence, make fleshcloaks out of babies, transform themselves into oozes, vampires, liches, rakshasa, power their magic through blood, worship (and feed!) the Meat, and embrace the darkness in the shadows around your gaming table.

Once I knew we were shoulder deep in vile gaming excellence the new objective was threefold in making the world of Askis, where being a villain makes good sense, a place that the party will want to grind into the dust all tied together in a story that makes sense and leaves the GM with everything needed to carry a campaign to a satisfying conclusion for an evil group. A year ago I thought up the first part (inaequa) and that's where the Kickstarter began-while I knew that it would ultimately come together, I didn't have it when we started. It took months of pondering, slowly gathering content and illustrations from essential parts of the project, but ultimately the Torquem Machina revealed itself in its full glory.

It's around that point that I began to go mad and now here we are, the art budget blown apart over more than 400 of the most glorious and decadent pages I've ever had the honor of putting together. I sincerely hope that you use the Book of Exalted Darkness responsibly and in excess, exploring the depths of your souls with villainous characters that stick with you until the end of your days.

Once again: thank you for taking this corrupting journey with us.
We hope you come back changed.

# NEW ATTRIBUTES 

The substantial matter of evil within the Book of True Evil is lent mechanical power by two new ability scoresSanctity and Sin-that every PC gains at character creation via their Inherent Heresy. Some feats or spells refer to a Sin score-if you are not utilizing these rules, the GM may substitute whatever ability score they see fit for Sin feats and spells.

Alignment and Competing Auras. When a creature's alignment is detected, if they are good their Sanctity score determines the strength of their aura and if they are evil their Sin score defines potency instead. A neutral creature's highest score determines whether the aura they give off is good or evil.

When a creature successfully makes a Sanctity check to hide their evil alignment, the strength of their aura of good is determined by their Sanctity score-while they may not appear to be evil, they probably won't light up as being particularly righteous.

Features or spells that leave an evil aura are marked by an evil creature's blackened soul and have a potency determined by its Sin score.

## SANCTITY

The state or quality of being holy, sacred, or saintly is not something that evil creatures are prone to but it can be emulated, the sheen on oily blackened souls enhanced to deceive those who look directly upon them.

A creature's Sanctity score is increased when it does a good deed and decreased when it is witnessed committing an evil act. The higher a creature's Sanctity score, the stronger its aura of good.

Sanctity can be used to fool inaequa-powered technology as well as the following ways:

- When attempting to hide its true nature via a disguise or the Deception skill, a creature may make a Sanctity ability check (instead of a Charisma check or tool kit check).
- When hit by a good creature with a weapon or spell attack, a creature can spend its reaction to prevent an amount of damage equal to double its Sanctity modifier. After this feature has been used, it cannot be used again until the creature has finished a long rest.
- When someone attempts to detect a creature's alignment, it may make a Sanctity check opposed by a Charisma check. On a success, the detected alignment is that of the creature's choosing.


## SIN

Immoral acts and blasphemous transgressions against the ruling divine powers of Askis accrue, transforming the very souls of those who commit foul deeds. As one performs more evil their essence becomes viler until eventually their bodies change as well, mutating into vilespawn.

A creature's Sin score is increased when it commits an evil act and decreased when it is seen doing good deeds. The higher a creature's Sin score, the stronger its aura of evil. When a creature's Sin ability score reaches 23 , it transforms into a vilespawn.

Sin can be used to overcharge inaequapowered technology as well as the following ways:

- When exercising power in a cruel way or using the Intimidation skill, a creature may make a Sin ability check (instead of a Charisma check or other check).
- When a creature successfully hits with a weapon or spell attack, it may spend its reaction to deal an extra amount of damage equal to double its Sin modifier bonus. After this feature has been used, it cannot be used again until the creature has finished a long rest.
- Instead of making a regular saving throw, a creature may make a Sin saving throw to resist being influenced through deception or magic.

---

# VILIS POINTS 

An evil adventurer begins play with a number of vilis points equal to their proficiency bonus, gaining 1 vilis point whenever they increase in level. The maximum number of vilis points an evil adventurer can have is equal to their level +1 .

At the end of a long rest, an evil adventurer regains a number of vilis points equal to half their proficiency bonus. In addition, when an evil adventurer increases their Sin score, they regain a number of vilis points equal to the increase.

By spending a vilis point as a reaction, an evil adventurer can do any of the following:

- Change the damage of a spell or weapon attack to necrotic.
- Reroll a failed ability check or saving throw.
- Gain a +1 d 6 bonus to an ability check or attack roll so long as it is part of committing an evil act (desecrating a holy object or place, delivering a poison, preparing a murderous ambush, telling a hurtful lie, and so on). At 10th level this bonus increases to +2 d 6 .
- Delay the effects of a spell for 1 d 4 minutes per spell level. By casting a spell at a spell slot one level higher, the delay can be additionally increased or decreased by 1 d 4 hours per spell slot level (with no other benefits of casting the spell at a higher spell slot).
- Power the use of various feats and features.


## INHERENT HIBBESIS

Adventurers in the Book of Exalted Darkness (and the Book of True Evil) are fundamentally flawed, their very souls bent to evil. Characters with an Inherent Heresy cannot be of good alignment.

Envy. A desire to possess what others have already has made you cunning, sharpening your wit to be as deadly as a blade.

- You are at disadvantage on Wisdom (Insight) and Charisma (Persuasion) checks when buying or selling items.
- Your Wisdom increases by 1.
- Your Sanctity score is 10 .
- Your Sin score is 1 d 4 .
- As a bonus action, you may spend 1 vilis point to gain advantage on a Wisdom ability check or saving throw.

Gluttony. Excess is everything-if you cannot have more, why have any at all?

- You always eat and drink more than anyone around you, paying twice as much as normal. For 1 hour afterward you have the poisoned condition (even if you are normally immune to poison).
- Your Constitution increases by 1.
- Your Sanctity score is 11 .
- Your Sin score is 1d4-1 (minimum 1).
- As a bonus action, you may spend 1 vilis point to gain advantage on a Constitution ability check or saving throw.

Greed. Being the quickest to harvest means gathering the finest crops and largest cut, and you deserve the most.

- You are an opportunist of the worst stripe and compulsively steal. A DC 12 Wisdom saving throw suppresses the compulsion for 1 hour.
- Your Dexterity increases by 1.
- Your Sanctity score is 7 .
- Your Sin score is 1 d 4+2.
- As a bonus action, you may spend 1 vilis point to gain advantage on a Dexterity ability check or saving throw.

Lust. The pleasures of the flesh are tantamount and you only ever feel complete while in coitus.

- You are not just promiscuous, you achieve sexual gratification as soon as the opportunity presents itself. Resisting the urge to engage in sexual conduct requires a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw.
- Your Charisma increases by 1.
- Your Sanctity score is 9 .
- Your Sin score is 1d4+1.
- As a bonus action, you may spend 1 vilis point to gain advantage on a Charisma ability check or saving throw.

---

# 2019 

Mendacity. You are emblematic of the notion that truth is subjective, spinning falsehoods as easily and often as other creatures breathe.

- Whether for entertainment, gain, guilt, pride, or other motivations, you lie up to half the time. A DC 12 Wisdom saving throw is required to suppress the compulsion for 10 minutes.
- Your Charisma score increases by 1.
- Your Sanctity score is 8 .
- Your Sin score is 1d6.
- You gain proficiency in Deception. If you gain proficiency in Deception from another source, you gain a +2 bonus on Charisma (Deception) checks.
- You may spend 1 vilis point to gain advantage on a Charisma (Deception) check.

Pride. You are a step apart from your daft peers, possessing a singularly adroit mind able to unlock secrets well beyond the ken of a normal mortal's brain.

- You are completely certain that your keen intellect makes you superior to everyone around you. Whenever the question of class or station comes up (particularly when dealing with authorities) you are at disadvantage on Wisdom (Insight) and Charisma (Persuasion) checks.
- Your Intelligence increases by 1.
- Your Sanctity score is 10 .
- Your Sin score is 1d4.
- As a bonus action, you may spend 1 vilis point to gain advantage on an Intelligence ability check or saving throw.

Sloth. Indolence is bliss but when you are called to act, you do so with the utmost efficiency and can call upon rested energies if need be.

- You are morbidly obese. Your base walking speed is reduced by 5 feet.
- Your Strength and Constitution increase by 1
and your Dexterity decreases by 2 .
- Your Sanctity score is 12 .
- Your Sin score is 1d4-1 (minimum 1).
- As a bonus action, you may spend Hit Dice to heal as if you had taken a short rest, spending 1 vilis point per 3 Hit Dice spent this way (minimum 1 vilis point). Once you have used this feature you cannot do so again until you have finished a short rest.

Wrath. Your very soul is consumed with a primal fury that drives you ever onward.

- Your face is almost always in a snarl and you must make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw to assume a different expression for up to 1 hour.
- Your Strength increases by 1.
- Your Sanctity score is 8 .
- Your Sin score is 1d4+1.
- As a bonus action, you may spend 1 vilis point to gain advantage on a Strength ability check or saving throw.

![img-4.jpeg](assets/Book%20of%20true%20Evil_img-4.jpeg)

The Samovi Preserve's inmates are well aware of purpura and some of the resourceful deviants don't just make the most of the magical creatures, they've created an art form out of manipulating, dissecting, and murdering the curious spies. Runts that aren't able to fend for themselves against other prisoners make it their niche to follow and track purpura, locating villages within hollowed out boles inside prodigious trees and miniature dug-out tunnel networks, turning over the information when intimidated or able to score a good deal on a trade.

Despite constant danger and consistently being the targets of atrocious mass-slaughters, purpura continue to mete out their short lives in the Samovi Preserve before meeting a violent end-not a one of them has been known to die of old age. The origins of these creatures are just as mysterious, appearing in Askis only after the island prison first rose into the sky, and wicked mages have concluded that "foot pigs" (as they are sometimes called) must have a connection to Adligamentum the Cincture of Binding, explaining their potent magical nature.

Regardless of whence they came the purpura are both pest and boon to the inmates upon which they spy. Illicit activities are extremely commonplace in the confines of the Samovi Preserve and most of them are either hidden from Tapper's underlings or quickly disrupted, but even when an endeavor is undone the possibility of capturing one of the damnable things can make up for lost resources. Purpura aren't just extremely savory, sweet, and filling, in the hands of even an amateur alchemist they can be used to truly nefarious ends!

Capture. Spotting a purpura is fairly common, but actually catching one of the elusive little folk is another matter entirely. The magical creatures are able to rapidly blend into their surroundings, have ways to embolden their hearts in times of great fright, and they can quickly trap areas nearby with dangerous incendiary fungi. Perhaps worst (or best) of all, a purpura is rarely abandoned by its friends and relatives-in a matter of hours they usually sneak into wherever a captive ally is being kept in covert rescue attempts.

---

Tricking. Though purpura are slightly smarter than the average citizen of Askis, the evil minds that resist conditioning at the hands of The Ministry often end up in the Samovi Preserve and are more than capable of out-thinking the naive little creatures. Staged performances of being outcast from a gang, "freeing" a captured purpura to return it home, and last-minute decisions to "fight" one's allies in defense of the tiny celestials are convincing enough as long as the actors have at least an ounce of talent for deception. Once trust has been gained inmates befriend the magical wonders, returning to receive the praise of a tiny village only to sneak away in the night to launch a raid while the benign creatures sleep. Otherwise canny prisoners will put on fake demonstrations in the clear eyes of purpura, knowing that Tapper's guards will believe what they're told (unaware their witnesses saw a ruse in the first place).

## USING PURPURA

Spreading misinformation is the best way to use a living purpura but they are a far more valuable resource to prisoners of the Samovi Preserve when they're dead. The preparation and consumption of the little creatures has been refined over the centuries, perfected by magicians behind the floating prison's walls into an art form that yields potent creationsconcoctions able to aid in escape from confinement by Tapper.

## TORTURE

One of the difficulties of preparing purpura concoctions is that their magical potency fades away in a matter of days. Properly preserving their remains with embalming fluid can increase their usefulness by a fair bit of time, but breaking a purpura's will before its death elongates that window far more impressively. Every day that a purpura is kept in the restrained condition or confined to a cage, it makes a Wisdom saving throw (DC $10+1$ per previous day) or loses its Resolve. A successful Charisma (Intimidation) check (DC 20 - 1 per day of captivity) by a purpura's captor causes it to make this saving throw with disadvantage.

Different purpura have different fears and the GM is the ultimate arbiter of what forms of torture are effective, but until a purpura's Resolve is stripped away torture just doesn't work. Every hour a purpura is subjected to torture, it makes a Constitution saving throw (DC $8+1 \mathrm{~d} 4+1$ per
previous save). On a failure by 5 or more, the torture either inflicts or causes the purpura to self-inflict enough damage to go unconscious (and possibly die). On a failure of less than 5 the purpura's Willpower is completely shattered.

The body parts of a purpura with broken Resolve last twice as long and the body parts of a purpura with broken Willpower last four times as long (see Table: Purpura Dissection).

## EATING

While rewarding in a variety of ways, not everyone has the time or leisure to prepare purpura concoctions -and they do taste very good unseasoned. Simple consumption of a purpura that has died within the past 1 d 4 hours grants the following benefits for 1 d 4 minutes, provided that the entirety of the purpura (cartilage-bones and all) are eaten by the same creature: the creature leaves no tracks, heals one Hit Dice worth of hit points, adds its proficiency bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks (even if it is already proficient), gains advantage on saving throws against fear and resistance to radiant damage. Eating any part of a fresh purpura's corpse is as filling as a full meal.

## DISSECTING

Removing the miniature organs from a purpura's tiny corpse is a delicate and difficult task that requires a sharp implement (usually a dagger) and either a healer's kit or thieves' tools. The extractor makes a Wisdom (Medicine) check over the course of 1 d 4 minutes cutting, cinching, and extracting the organ in question. Attempting to dissect a purpura without either imposes disadvantage on the check, and without a means to deal at least 1 piercing or slashing damage it is impossible to dissect a purpura.

## PURPURA CONCOCTIONS

Crafting a purpura concoction takes 1 hour per point of DC in its Alchemist Supplies check but has no exceptional costs or components aside from the creature's corpse. For example, brewing some purprapaste takes 12 hours. One month after it is created, a purpura concoction loses half its potency (granting benefits for half as long, restoring half as many hit points, dealing half as much damage, and so on). Two months after it is created a purpura concoction goes inert.

Unless otherwise noted, imbibing or otherwise using a purpura concoction requires an action. Purpura concoctions and their effects are not magical.

12 Purprasaks. As an action, a creature throws a purprasak by making a ranged attack against a creature or object with range, treating purprasak as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes damage as the purprasak explodes. All other objects and creatures within 5 feet of an exploding purprasak make a Dexterity saving throw or take half damage.

From the foliage nearby you bear the distinct and odd tones of a truly small voice loudly singing, its squeaky notes just on the edge of painful as they float through the air. The melody comes from a miniature bumanoid with a pristine white smock on its head, its little purple gnome-like face gleefully grinning as it obliviously skips on its way, a tiny bundle of joy.

Natural Kindness. The purpura has disadvantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks.

Purpura are loving, trustworthy, benign creatures spawned from the errant energies created by one of the Bands of Kyttarmoak (Adligamentum the Cincture of Binding) and its interactions with the Samovi Preserve. They live simple lives in secret villages of no more than a score of their kind, spending their days spying on the doings of larger creatures, foraging to peacefully live off of the land around them, or singing with joy. It is extremely rare to see an elder purpura-these few tiny celestials have wizened up (losing the Natural Kindness feature) and remain supremely aloof.

# EVIL BACKGROUNDS 

Many of the standard character backgrounds (like the acolyte) are already in a keen place to be used for evil characters but some unlawful compulsions extend beyond those of a mere criminal. These are several additional character backgrounds to accommodate evil characters.

## ARSONIST

There's something about fire that speaks directly to you, invigorating your soul whenever a flame dances nearby. It's no wonder that you cannot help but set things alight, reveling in the incendiary destruction of the world around you. The smells, the licking flames, the crackle and pop as whatever is thrown into the fire turns to ashes as all things do-there is nothing better.
Skill Proficiencies: Athletics, Nature
Tool Proficiencies: Alchemist's supplies
Equipment: Alchemist's supplies
Feature: Pyromaniac. Your Sin score increases by 1 and the DC of saving throws against fire-based attacks or spells you make or cast is increased by 1.

## CURSED BLOOD

Someone among your ancestors dabbled in evil and planted the seed of great malevolence into their blood, passing it along generations that only caused the corruption to grow and spread until your accursed birth. Your life has been dreadfully oppressive, almost as though the world has a grudge against you and only you. The only things of value you've inherited from your unhelpful and unloving family are the relics of that bemoaned ancestor whom set your suffering into motion all those years ago.
Skill Proficiencies: Perception, Survival
Tool Proficiencies: Ceremonial relics
Equipment: Ceremonial relics
Feature: Born Evil. Your Sin score increases by 3 and you gain your proficiency bonus on Sin ability checks and saving throws.

## DEVIANT

"Normal is only a setting on machines" is a phrase common in Askis but you've found that when put to the test it usually falters. Something about you is and always has been fundamentally off, different from your peers. All attempts to overcome this oddness have failed utterly and you have simply come to accept that for whatever reason, you are not like others.
Skill Proficiencies: Insight, Perception
Tool Proficiencies: Artisan's tools

Equipment: Artisan's tools
Feature: On or Off. Individuals either like you or dislike you. Whenever you meet a new NPC and begin a conversation the GM makes a secret dice roll.

On an odd result the NPC dislikes and fears you, causing you to make Deception and Persuasion checks against them with disadvantage but giving you advantage on Intimidation checks against them.

On an even result the NPC senses your loneliness and likes you, granting you advantage on Deception and Persuasion checks against them but causing you to make Intimidation checks against them with disadvantage.

## FOOLISH SPELUNKER

Despite being warned against it, while exploring the countryside of Askis or the sewers beneath a settlement you discovered a strange cave and followed, traveling deep underground. There you were struck by a strange phantasmal energy that bounded along the passageways, passing through you but not without leaving a touch of
![img-7.jpeg](assets/Book%20of%20true%20Evil_img-7.jpeg)
wyrd that has darkened your soul.
Skill Proficiencies: Athletics, Survival
Tool Proficiencies: Navigator's tools
Languages: Vilespeech
Equipment: Climber's kit, map of caverns deep underground leading to an unknown location, navigator's tools, 4 days rations
Feature: Touched Soul. In addition to increasing your Sin score by 1 , your encounter beneath the surface of Askis left you with the knowledge of and ability to cast two of the following cantrips: dancing lights, druidcraft, light, mage band, mending, message, prestidigitation, spare the dying, or thaumaturgy.

---

# HEXED 

You were born without corruption or evil but had the misfortune of crossing paths with a wicked character that has cursed your soul. Whether or not you knew of your hex, it has festered for too long to be removed and has forever changed your life, dooming you to an ignoble end.
Skill Proficiencies: Insight, Perception
Tool Proficiencies: Artisan's tools
Equipment: Artisan's tools
Feature: Resist Magic. The corruption of your soul has not been entirely without benefit and the changes wrought on your essence have made it more resistant to magic. When making a saving throw to resist a spell, your bonus to the saving throw increases by 1 .

## INAEQUA TECHNICIAN

While inaequa is a wonderful and impressive resource the machines that utilize it require constant attention and maintenance in order to function correctly-you were one of the countless technicians that performed that essential work.
Skill Proficiencies: Science, Technology
Tool Proficiencies: Tinker's tools
Equipment: A bottle of black ink, a quill, a small book detailing various inaequa circuitry patterns, tinker's tools, a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 10 gp
Feature: Mechanical Knack. You are really good at making a machine work even when it doesn't want to. You gain advantage on Sanctity checks made to trick an inaequa-powered device into functioning for you.

## MURDERER

You have done the unthinkable and taken the life of another. The authorities of Askis never willingly kill another creature unless it is absolutely, unquestionably necessary and subjects those that do to intense mental conditioning in a thorough rehabilitation process with a terrifyingly low recidivism rate. Unlike the others you were "treated" alongside, your will was not broken and you are just as ruthless as you were when you went on the inside-now you're just better at hiding it.
Skill Proficiencies: Deception, Sleight of Hand
Tool Proficiencies: Painter's supplies
Equipment: A trophy taken from a victim (locks of hair, teeth, ears, fingers, toes, nails, eyes, tongues), a dagger, a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 10 gp
Feature: Ruthless Strike. In the first round of combat if you have successfully concealed a weapon by making
a (retroactive if necessary) Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, you gain advantage on your first attack roll as long as it is made before the next round. If this attack hits a creature that was unaware of the weapon it is a critical hit (if you roll a natural critical hit you deal double your proficiency bonus in extra damage). If you have the Sneak Attack feature you deal your Sneak Attack damage with this attack. In addition, your Sin score increases by 1.

## THIEF

It isn't easy being a burglar in Askis but you have successfully made a go of it by virtue of luck, a reassuring smile, and the ability to quickly lose your pursuers. You also know from experience that the heat really only comes on when blood is spilt-it's smarter to abscond without the goods than to resort to violence and even then, it's important to sell what you've got quickly even if it means taking a hit on the take.
Skill Proficiencies: Deception, Stealth
Tool Proficiencies: Thieves' tools
Equipment: Thieves' tools
Feature: Escapist. You are exceptionally talented at winning in a chase (if the chase rules are in effect you gain advantage on one check each round while you are being chased, although this does not benefit your companions). Creatures tracking you with Wisdom (Survival) checks have disadvantage and when you are in an urban area you gain advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to blend in with a crowd.

## TRAITOR

There was once a place or group that accepted you utterly, giving you great access to its resources and secrets. Their trust was misplaced however and your loyalty was bought away, telling rivals of their weaknesses and vulnerabilities in exchange for a bag of gold.
Skill Proficiencies: Deception, Insight
Tool Proficiencies: Gaming set
Equipment: 50 gold
Feature: Bribed. You begin play with one magic item of uncommon rarity chosen from the following list (roll 1d10): 1-bag of tricks (rust), 2-boys of efvenkind, 3-boots of striding and springing, 4 -cloak of efvenkind, 5-decanter of endless water, 6 -everymoking bottle, 7 -eyes of minute seeing, 8 -eyes of the eagle, 9 -gloves of missile snaring, 10 -gloves of climbing and swimming. You cannot sell or trade this item until you have reached at least 5th level (though you may lose it or have it stolen from you if circumstances prevail).

---

In addition, your Sin score increases by 4 and you are hunted by those that seek vengeance for whatever you did to acquire your wealth. The full breadth of what your nemeses will do to have their revenge is at the GM's discretion (though at the very least bounty hunters, Justitia, and private investigators attempt to capture you once each month).

# UNHOLY WITNESS 

The doings of evil are a rare thing in Askis but that makes it all the more traumatizing when one of its coddled citizens bear witness. Perhaps you were a guard that responded to a foul disturbance, someone passing by to see a thing from beyond slain, or even a surviving victim of a cult ritual-either way you gazed upon something no mortal was ever meant to see. This dark knowledge has tainted your very soul and fundamentally changed you, bending your future towards evil.
Skill Proficiencies: Insight, Perception
Tool Proficiencies: Artisan's tools
Languages: Vilespeech
Equipment: A set of artisan's tools (one of your choice), a set of common clothes, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp
![img-8.jpeg](assets/Book%20of%20true%20Evil_img-8.jpeg)

Feature: Natural Sinner. Your Sin increases by 1. Roll 1d20 whenever you spend a vilis point. On a result of 19 or 20 you do not have to expend the vilis point to benefit from it.
![img-9.jpeg](assets/Book%20of%20true%20Evil_img-9.jpeg)

Cackling with glee as the villagers flee from ber terrifying servants, the tiefling commands her ghoul and lemure to bold down the town's priest and draws forth her sickle. She grabs bim by the hair and savagely cuts it away, nicking his scalp and washing his face in red blood, blinding him as she retreats before the shouting of the local guards-this is only the beginning of the holy man's tormented path to corruption before her infernal allies claim his soul.

As expected, the allure of the succubus the dwarf summoned is more than enough to entice the merchant quarry to drop his guard, leaving the tavern like a fool. The man's bodyguards follow but the will-o'-wisps bent to Virrdio's will distract their simple minds and by the time the swords of any defenders can react to the dying trader's screams, the dwarf and his fiendish servant are long gone.

Diabolists are not typical mages or priests and devote themselves not to study or prayer, only to finding and taking the fastest pursuits to powerthrough dark pacts with evil creatures hungering for the foolish souls of bargainers. These greedy and despicable individuals wager everything to make fell bargains with not just one creature from beyond the Material Plane but many entities, calling on the malevolent powers of the Abyss or Hell to do their bidding. Any and all dark arts are the purview of diabolists and there is no depth to which they will not sink as they seek to conjure ever more powerful allies. The compacts one must strike in order to summon evil entities with a whim are dire indeed however, and the further along the corrupted path one travels the greater they find the demands of their otherworldly partners.

---

# Forbidden Secrets 

The path of the diabolist is rarely lauded or promoted within society and the very nature of their art requires one to have a taste for taboo knowledge. Only the strong of will and spirit can endure the trials required to learn the secrets of diabolism, and though master summoners frequently take on many apprentices most of these deluded fools are merely pawns used for sacrifice. Devious, foul, and wily as they are, diabolists are ever keen to acquire relics, tokens of power, or forbidden lore whenever the opportunity arises and they can be trusted to do whatever they must in their relentless pursuits.

## Unyielding Avarice

Greed is what inspires most diabolists to take up the darkest arts of conjuration but they are never sated-the need for more power and wealth drives them ever forward the further they fall toward depravity in a vicious cycle that ends in eternal torment. The aid of demons and devils does not come without a cost however, and either divine relics, great treasures, or the souls of the living must be sacrificed in order for diabolists to forge new unholy alliances.

## Creating a Diabolist

The first thing to decide when making a diabolist are the circumstances that led your character to seek out unholy alliances: are they destined to bring balance to the forces of good and evil, driven to do whatever they must to become rich, or tricked to stray into the depths of depravity? Have they any remorse for the horrendous acts they perform in exchange for power? While your diabolist is undoubtedly evil, is there any good still within the corruption overtaking their soul? Are they totally consumed with achieving their goals and willing to go to any lengths to do so?

Does your character impose their will on lawful servants, or are they an enslaver of chaotic entities, or devoted only to their goals and working with whatever allies they can conjure? Do they seek to inspire fear or attempt to blend in with the sheep of society? Perhaps most importantly, how will they save their soul from the end of their bargains with the powerful creatures that act as their lackeys-or have they fallen too far to care?

## CLASS FEATURES

As a diabolist, you gain the following class features.
Alignment. Diabolists cannot be of good alignment. If your group uses alignment, a diabolist whose alignment becomes good cannot level in this class again until their alignment changes from good.

# Diabolist Spellcasting 

At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric and wizard spell lists or the vile school of magic. You learn one additional cantrip at 5th level, 10th level, 15th level, and 20th level.

You receive a number of conjuring points determined by your diabolist level. You are able to cast the find familiar spell as an action by expending 1 conjuring point. Conjuring points are restored at the end of a short or long rest.

Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your diabolist spells, since you draw your spells from a dark connection between your soul and things from the beyond. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a diabolist spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

Spell save $\mathrm{DC}=8+$ your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

## Masterful Presence

While you are not wearing any armor or using a shield, your Armor Class equals $10+$ your Dexterity modifier + your Charisma modifier.

## Necromantic Touch

Starting at 1st level, the fell pacts you've made have garnered you a measure of power that lets you manifest energy antithetical to life but one that revitalizes the forces of evil. As an action, you may make a melee spell attack, dealing 1 d 8 necrotic damage to a living creature on a hit. If you kill a creature using Necromantic Touch, you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to the damage you dealt with the killing blow. Unlike normal temporary hit points these stack and you may gain a maximum number of temporary hit points this way equal to twice your diabolist level. When you target one of your diaboli with this feature, you restore the creature's hit points instead.

At 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level this feature increases by 1 d 8 .

## Diabolic Resistance

Beginning at 2nd level, you gain resistance to poison damage and advantage on saving throws to resist being poisoned.

## Diabolic Strike

At 2nd level you channel more unholy power into your strikes, adding your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (whichever is higher) to your Necromantic Touch.

You may choose not to add your Charisma modifier to your Necromantic Touch to instead inflict a condition on your target, forcing them to make a saving throw against DC $8+$ your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier. On a failed save, the target gains the blinded or deafened condition for a number of rounds equal to your diabolist level. The target may repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the condition on a success. You may attempt to inflict a condition a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, after which you must complete a long rest before you can do so again.

## Summoning

Starting at 3rd level, you learn to summon lesser creatures to do your bidding. At first these minor diaboli are undead creatures as all diabolists dabble in necromancy, but inevitably acquaintances are made with daemons, demons, and devils.

Summoning a diabolus takes an entire turn during which you do not take any movement or other actions (including reactions) and expend conjuring points equal to the amount listed for the creature. If you take damage while summoning a diabolus, a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration is required or the diabolus dies in transition. You summon diaboli that appear in unoccupied spaces that you can see within range. Once summoned a diabolus remains on the Material Plane until it has taken an amount of damage equal to its hit points, you dismiss it as a reaction, or the diabolus travels more than 500 feet from you. If a diabolus suffers a critical hit you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw to concentrate and to maintain your connection to it or you lose control of the creature (at the GM's discretion it may attack an ally, but never you). You may only have a number of summoned diaboli equal to your proficiency bonus.

Diaboli are friendly to you but not necessarily your companions-the further removed an ally's alignment is from a diabolus, the less likely the diabolus is to be friendly when interacting with that companion. Roll initiative for your diaboli as a group, which has its own turns. They obey any verbal (or telepathic)

---

commands that you issue to them (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands to them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures, but otherwise take no actions. Diaboli with innate spellcasting can cast a number of spells equal to the conjuring points you spent to summon the diabolus but afterward you must expend 1 conjuring point to have a diabolus use its innate spellcasting.

In addition, you are able to cast any spell with the ritual tag so long as the spell level is equal to or less than half your diabolist level. You may only cast a number of ritual spells equal to your proficiency bonus before requiring a long rest to cast more ritual spells. You may use either an arcane focus or a divine focus as a spellcasting focus for your diabolist spells.

Minoe Diaboli (1 Conjuring Point):
Cacodaemon (CR 1⁄2, page 152),
Skeleton (CR 1⁄4), Zombie (CR 1⁄4)

## Unholy Familiar

Beginning at 3rd level, the familiar you summon is undead. It gains darkvision 60 ft ., resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical weapons, immunity to necrotic and poison damage, and immunity to the following conditions: charmed, exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed, poisoned.

## Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2 , or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1 . As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

## Telepathic

Starting at 5th level, you gain telepathy to a range of 30 feet and darkvision 60 feet. When using telepathy with your diaboli, the range increases to 60 feet.

## Dark Path

The evil pacts you've made with lesser creatures have their limitations and eventually you find their gifts lacking, leaving your lust for power to drive you to find darker entities to make your allies. At 6th level, you choose to focus your studies on either the summoning of ephemeral undead and demons or corporeal unlife and devils.

At 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th level you learn to summon more creatures determined by your Dark Path.
![img-10.jpeg](assets/Book%20of%20true%20Evil_img-10.jpeg)

## Banisher

Starting at 7th level you can cast banishment or ballow (evil options only) by expending 2 conjuring points.

## Voodoo

At 7th level you gain the Voodoo ritual feat (page 78).

## Breathless

Starting at 10th level, you no longer need to breathe. You gain advantage on saving throws against spells and effects that come from dangerous gases.

## Diabolic Blood

At 10th level, you gain immunity to poison damage and the poisoned condition.

## Expanded Mind

Beginning at 11th level, the range of your telepathy increases to 60 feet, or 120 feet if communicating with your diaboli. The range of your darkvision increases to 120 feet.

## Scion of Evil

Starting at 13th level, you gain advantage on saving throws made to resist the spells and effects of undead. You also gain advantage to saving throws made to

---

resist the spells and effects of the type of fiends you can summon via your Dark Path (daemons and either demons or devils).

## Diabolic Essence

At 14th level you gain resistance to necrotic damage.

## Unbound Soul

Beginning at 17th level, the range of your telepathy increases to 120 feet. As long as a diabolus is on the same plane of existence, you can communicate with them using your telepathy. In addition, your darkvision can also see through magical darkness and you can cast plane shift or teleport by expending 4 conjuring points.

# Planar Master of Evil 

At 20th level you gain immunity to necrotic damage. You learn the true name of an extraplanar creature determined by your dark path, forcing it to become one of your diaboli: either a Heavoc demon (CR 8) or a Chaos Devil (CR 8). You may spend 100 gp in materials throughout an hour long ritual to summon this diaboli, or you may expend 10 conjuring points to summon it. Once per month you can perform a ritual requiring 500 gp and $1 \mathrm{~d} 4+1$ hours to summon a more powerful demon or devil, but this may be met with a celestial response by the powers of good (at the GM's discretion).

In addition, for a number of rounds equal to your proficiency bonus you do not take energy damage from an environmental effect of a plane that is not your own (usually the Material Plane). You may spend a conjuring point to increase the duration of this feature to a number of minutes equal to your proficiency bonus. Afterward it can be extended by 1 hour per additional spent conjuring point.

## Devilish Dark Path

You sought out the devils in Hell in your pursuit to power. Your agreement with infernal creatures allow you to call on them to do battle, practice guile, and otherwise serve you.

# MABSSJENTIST 

Sliding back into the shadows of the kitchen, Varystrax smoothes out her worker's apron and gently covers the belt of syringes bidden beneath it. She can't resist basking in self-satisfaction as the servant comes in to prepare the Archbishop of Paenitio's breakfast, staying far longer than is safe for any alibi. Waiting until the commoner's footsteps-taking the tray of toast and expertly poisoned coffee up the stairs-to echo down the hallway, she reaches down to her belt and activates her form disruptor. With a loud pop and hiss the device flickers on and she utterly disappears from sight, sprinting towards the servant's entrance. A piercing scream cuts through the air as Varystrax scales the mansion's wall, and knowing that her earlier delay will necessitate laying low for more than a while anyway, she stops to watch as the old man struggles through a high window, his face purple as a beet and popping with red, festering sores. As he loses his balance she briefly depowers her gadget so that their eyes can meet and be points out towards her but falls out into the open air, bitting the ground with a sickening smack as his killer sprints off to grab a train out of the city before the news breaks.

Sweating from hours of effort, Maridivius cuts the last bit of thread and steps back to appreciate his work. The patient was unwilling of course so some blunt anesthesia was required, but fortunately only the bruising on her skull mars his newest creation's beauty. The farm girl's face is otherwise intact as are her legs, but the lass' weak, ineffectual arms lay discarded on the floor nearby-Maridivius has greatly improved her with some burly limbs taken from a recently slain orc dockworker instead. What a great gift this young woman has just received, he thinks, how much faster she'll finish her chores! As her eyes flutter open he grins broadly, arms crossed in satisfaction, but after confusedly looking about she gaze downward and sees the bulging, green arms connected to her sides. She turns to regard the doctor and screams, pressing against the restraints and frothing at the mouth as the chirurgeon dashes forward to stick a syringe into her neck, taking ber back to unconsciousness. Well, Maridivius reflects, she'll learn to like it.

Dawn breaks over the city of Patefactio and a lone figure slowly moves down the outside of The Ministry's local skyscraper. To observers on the ground Korexa's arachno belt makes her look like a large spider, something sure to titillate the dull minds of those below her when they read the headlines of tomorrow's papers. As she always does on the weekdays Broadcasting Director Lydia Harquist slept in her office on the 27th floor, and like other mornings her usual recording of the Ballad of Varrus softly begins reverberating out into the morning air above the settlement-but unlike other mornings Korexa has been waiting for this very moment. She risks a glance down into the room to see her target's back turned, pulling away a circle of cut glass just large enough to fit a small melon through. Lydia feels a chill run down her spine and glances upward in time to see two metallic cylinders sail through the room towards her, landing on the floor and rolling into the wall. The realization of what they are bits as the grenades explode, the most influential bureaucrat of radio in the region flung outward in a halo of glass as Korexa cackles with glee at the size of the blast her explosives just made, skittering back towards the roof and a rapid escape by bang glider.

Huffing from the exertion of so much sprinting, Zedro begins to second guess his plan just when the door to the Generator Control Room finally comes into view at the end of the hallway. Cursing at the damned fire alarm for shutting off a few seconds early, he pulls out a set of tools and rapidly picks the lock to the chamber, quickly stepping inside. Therein lay the prize: the inaequa well of Suppetia. Cracking his fattened fingers, the dapper but ungainly half-orc wraps meaty, fleshy fists around the bandholds of the attenuators arrayed on either side and feeds his darkened soul into the devices. They resist him but in only a few moments he knows their schematics, reaching around to make minute adjustments that cause their bum to change in pitch ever so slightly. Still panting he swears again, grabbing a worker's cap from a book on the wall before stepping outside and closing the locked door behind him. With the exit just a hundred feet ahead he jumps in genuine fear as the city's power source is attended to once again and an explosion ripples through the building! Anxious as he is the foolish guards believe his innocence and Zedro successfully escapes, managing to fight back his grin until after ducking down an alleyway to plan on how best to reach his headquarters now that the first steps of his scheme have been delayed by nearly two minutes.

Mad scientists are the most common wicked souls to survive capture and reformation or imprisonment at the hands of Askis' defenders, hidden and aided by technology much harder to detect and track than magic. They form the backbone of resistance against the world order, relying on their cunning and intellect where others would turn to strength of arm or flee in cowardice. That is not to say you don't appreciate weaponry, howeverin order to survive and ultimately enact justice on the society that has cast you out for your intellectual pursuits, devices of both defensive and offensive intent are of the utmost importance.

## For SCIENCE!

Whether neutral or evil, a mad scientist prizes the pursuit of knowledge above all other things. They may not care what must be done to acquire information, the dangers of learning forbidden secrets, or frequently the consequences of experimentation (particularly when inflicted upon creatures other than themselves). Adventuring and exploration go hand in hand to provide stimulating new insights into a wide variety of fields. Moreover, groups of adventurers make for great pack animals (if treated with enough respect) and can provide a measure of safety when delicate research is required at a hostile site.

## Selective Isolation

Society repels those who follow unapproved scientific pursuits, disbarring them from study at institutions of higher learning and carefully watching expelled students long after their education has ended. Already cast as pariahs, it is difficult for mad scientists to truly reform and properly become a part of any community-yet to survive and continue their work they must befriend others whether to acquire some obscurity from Inquisitors, find esoteric and rare resources, gather test subjects, or effect a quick means of getting out of town. After the usually unexpectedly unfair treatment received at the hands of Askis' higher powers it comes naturally to them to keep these associations a secret, ever watchful for potential agents from The Inquisition lurking nearby.

## Creating a Mad Scientist

The first thing to decide when making a mad scientist is the field of study which most interests your character. Do you seek to understand how things are understood? Work the flesh of creatures in ways both terrifying and wondrous?

Manipulate technology to maximize its offensive potential? Bend the divine machines of civilization to your will?

Knowing the area of science that most interests you can be further explored to give your maniacal master of machines more depth. Why have they decided their field of study is superior to others? What ultimate truth do they hope to learn in their intellectual pursuits? Or were you left with no choice by a haunting spirit or a lack of opportunity? Did circumstance force your hand into mastering science? Either way you must have some ideas on where your studies will go-what grand experiments do you hope to undertake?

## CLASS FEATURES

As a mad scientist, you gain the following class features.

Alignment. Mad scientists cannot be of either lawful or good alignment. A mad scientist whose alignment becomes lawful good, neutral good, chaotic good, or lawful neutral cannot level in this class again until their alignment changes back to an alignment that is either not lawful or not good.

Multiclassing Prerequisite: Intelligence 15
Proficiencies Gained: Science and Technology
Weaponized Spellcasting
At 1st level, you learn how to craft a technological weapon that can produce scientific effects identical to spells. When you cast spells, you do so by activating your technological weapon, making it a requirement for the casting of all spells as though it were an arcane or divine focus. Only you are able to use your technological weapon. It has an AC equal to $10+$ double your proficiency bonus and 5 hit points per mad scientist level.

At 9th level, the spells you cast using Weaponized Spellcasting are immune to the effects of counterspell and dispel magic.

At 18th level, they become immune to the effects of antimagic field.

---

# Cantrips 

You learn two cantrips of your choice from the mad scientist spell list. You learn additional mad scientist cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Mad Scientist table.

## Spell Slots

Table: Mad Scientist shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your mad scientist spells of 1st-level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest. For example, when you are 5 th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell thunderwave, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.

## Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher

At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the mad scientist spell list. The Spells Known column of Table: Mad Scientist shows when you learn more mad scientist spells of your choice of 1st-level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new mad scientist spell, which can be 1st-, 2nd-, or 3rd-level. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the mad scientist spells you know and replace it with another spell from the mad scientist spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

## Spellcasting Ability

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your spells, since you learn your spells through careful application of honed techniques derived from centuries of accumulated knowledge. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

Spell save DC $=8+$ your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
Spell attack modifier $=$ your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

## Spellcasting Focus

You can use your technological weapon a spellcasting focus for your mad scientist spells.

---

your choice, as shown in the Gadgets Known column of the Mad Scientist table. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the gadgets you know and replace it with another gadget that you could learn at that level.

Your scientific gadgets weigh 1 pound per spell level. The AC of a gadget is equal to your AC while it is on your person and it has a number of hit points equal to twice your mad scientist level. While not in your possession, one of your gadgets has an AC equal to $10+$ spell level. Other creatures are unable to understand how your gadgets function and only you are able to use them.

In addition, you gain proficiency with alchemist's supplies.

## Forbidden Knowledge

Starting at 3rd level, you gain one ritual feat (selected from the core rules or from those presented on pages $75-78$ ) or one sinful feat (pages 78-84). In addition, you learn how to cast ritual spells from either the cleric spell list or wizard spell list.

## Insane Contraptions

At 6th level, you gain a second ritual feat or sinful feat. When performing a ritual, if you have access to an anvil and smithery you may spend an additional hour building an insane contraption to incorporate the effects of one of your known spells or scientific gadgets into the casting of the ritual spell. The full effects of an insane contraption are at the discretion of the GM (some may simply add a light show, others might create genuinely impressive if unreliable effects).

## Technological Crafting

Starting at 7th level, you are able to create technological items that duplicate the effects of magical items without the need for inaequam, using mundane means and mechanical genius instead. You are only able to craft one technological item at a time. You are able to craft a common technological item over the course of a week of tinkering for 25 gold. You may craft an uncommon technological item over the course of a month for 500 gold (or more, at the GM's discretion).

At 14th level, you are able to craft a rare technological item over the course of 3 months of tinkering; the cost in materials is at the GM's discretion.

## Analyze Weakness

At 9th level, by spending a bonus action you may make an Intelligence check against a DC equal to the CR of a creature. On a success, you learn the attacks, immunities, features, and resistances granted by the target's race or type. You must be able to see or hear the target and the full breadth of what you learn is at the discretion of the GM (particularly obscure
![img-12.jpeg](assets/Book%20of%20true%20Evil_img-12.jpeg)
monsters may reveal very little and a hidden weapon remains hidden). You can only use this feature against an individual target once every 24 hours.

## Prototype Drones

At 10th level, you can cast the find familiar spell as a ritual, summoning (i.e.: activating) a number of drones equal to your proficiency modifier. The drone familiars you create are constructs with the appearance and abilities of any of the animals listed under the spell, or drones with an appearance chosen by you. Drones that are not duplicating the appearance and abilities of an animal use the Homunculus stat block. As constructs, the drones do not need to eat, sleep, or breathe, and are immune to both poison damage and the poisoned condition.

Your drones may not be dismissed as the spell. You may share senses with the drones or communicate with them while they remain within distance of your radio transmitter (a device that broadcasts 50 feet per mad scientist level).

## Diviner of Secrets

Starting at 13th level, you gain a third ritual feat and learn how to cast ritual spells from either the cleric or wizard spell list (whichever you did not already know).

## Hardened by Experimentation

Starting at 14th level, you gain advantage on checks made with alchemist's supplies. In addition, you gain resistance to acid, lightning, and poison damage.

## Grenadier

At 15th level, you learn how to craft grenades. Each day when you prepare your spells, you may make a

---

number of grenades with a total price equal to 10 times your mad scientist level. These grenades do not cost you gold to produce but do require a part of your essence to remain unignited, causing them to explode 1d6 rounds after being given to another creature. The saving throw DCs for grenades you create using this feature use your spell save DC.

In addition, as an action you may throw up to 3 grenades at different squares within range.

# Master Blaster 

At 18th level, you gain advantage on spell attacks using your technological weapon.

## Master Technologist

At 20th level, your mastery over technology is remarkable. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses Technology and you have advantage on Intelligence (Technology) checks. In addition, so long as they are able to hear you, you may advise an ally on how to activate one of your scientific gadgets after you have altered it for their use. You may keep a number of these altered devices equal to your Intelligence modifier.

## FIELDS OF MAD SCIENCE

Mad scientists are masters of technology but tend to focus their efforts on one or another aspect. This specialization makes you peerless in your field of expertise, granting special features that reflect your superior understanding of analysis, fleshcraft, offensive devices, or inaequa-powered machines.

## ENGINEER OF EVIL

To remain beyond the grasp of inquisitors and insure you leave no trail for hunters to follow after a dastardly deed, you pursue analysis to better fool divinations, sensors, and the senses of Askis' defenders. Lurking unseen and working from the shadows, you strike from out of nowhere and disappear before any true pursuit can be mounted to stop your next devious deed!

## Presence Detector

Starting at 1st level, as an action, you can activate a small monocular device that allows you to detect the forces of evil and good. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity. Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated (as with the ballow spell), any especially evil or good creatures, and evil auras left by magic. This feature otherwise functions like the detect magic spell with the visibility of auras at the discretion of the GM. You can use this feature a number of times equal to $1+$ your Intelligence modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.

## Divinus Screener

Beginning at 5th level, you learn how to craft a device that fools detection magics. Whenever you are targeted by a divination spell, you may spend your reaction to gain immunity to the spell. You must be aware of the spell being cast to use this feature. Alternatively you may always have the device active, in which case it automatically negates divination spells cast at you regardless of whether or not you know of their casting. It is a free action to check your divinus screener to see how many charges it currently has. Once this feature has been used a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, you require a long rest before it can be used again.

## Keen Analysis

At 11th level, you gain advantage on checks made using your Analyze Weakness feature. In addition to the knowledge it normally grants, you learn a number of additional pieces of information equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). At the GM's discretion these may inform you of class features, feats, legendary actions, or other secretive information directly related to combat.

## Locate Vulnerability

At 17th level, your talent for analysis reaches a terrifying plateau and you learn how to exploit the most nuanced of

---

weaknesses in an enemy's defenses. By spending an action and making a successful spell attack using your technological weapon against a creature you have successfully used Analyze Weakness against, you give the target vulnerability to one of the following elements: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. Creatures that are immune to the element you choose lose their immunity and gain resistance instead. Creatures that are resistant to the element you choose lose their resistance. The vulnerability lasts for 1 minute. At the end of its turn each round, a target may spend its bonus action to make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC to end the effect.

## FLESHWORKER

You are a master of chirurgery, a field of study that represents a combination of medical skills encompassing the encyclopedic diagnosis of ailments, the swift and skillful compounding of medicines tailored for them and the needs of the patient, as well as a deft hand at surgical maneuvers, operations, and equipment. With this knowledge and experience in hand, you are able to repair the physical body like a finely tuned machine. The radical procedures of chirurgery are so extreme that you can even manipulate the mind itself by subtle application of your techniques and alchemical concoctions to the nervous system.

Note: At the GM's discretion, a warlock may choose this archetype instead of a patron (gaining the 5th level features at 6th level, 11th level feature at 10th level, and 17th level feature at 14th level). A warlock using this archetype gains both the pact of the blade (choosing a weapon that deals slashing damage) and pact of the chain (gaining a Homunculus as their familiar) but does not gain patron spells.

## Medicinal Training

Starting at 1st level, you gain proficiency in Medicine, and you are able to use Intelligence instead of Wisdom when using Medicine. If you have or gain proficiency in Medicine from another source, your proficiency bonus doubles on Wisdom (Medicine) checks. In addition, you learn 1 chirurgical procedure.

## Novice Fleshcraft

Beginning at 5th level, you learn 1 chirurgical procedure. In addition, you are able to perform chirurgical procedures on yourself, though you do so with disadvantage.

## Surgical Precision

At 5th level, you learn how to best strike a living creature with deadly effectiveness, gaining proficiency with martial weapons. In addition, once per turn you can deal an extra 2 d 6 damage to one living creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or ranged weapon.

You don't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't incapacitated, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

The amount of the extra damage increases by 2d6 at 11th and 17th level (to a maximum of 6d6).

## Deft Hands

At 11th level, you learn 2 chirurgical procedures and gain proficiency in Sleight of Hand. In addition, you are not at disadvantage when performing a chirurgical procedure on yourself and the time it takes you to perform a chirurgical procedure is halved.

## Master Fleshworker

At 17th level, you learn all the chirurgical procedures and have advantage on checks made to perform an operation (even when operating on yourself). The time it takes you to perform a lengthy chirurgical procedure is reduced by a number of hours equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1 hour). In addition, you finish building a dissectrinator (page 150). Your dissectrinator can be controlled with bonus actions to attack a target you point to, but otherwise you control it as if you were using command spell.

## TRICKSTER

To defeat the powers that be there you seek to push technology to its limits, focusing your efforts on explosives, traps, and outsmarting your opponents. You have a penchant for incendiary devices and dangerous machines, bending your mind to perfecting their use in combat.

## Overcharged Shot

Starting at 1st level, when you have advantage on a spell attack using your technological weapon, you may choose to make the attack normally to deal an extra 1d4 damage per 2 mad scientist levels (minimum 1d4). Once you have used this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, you cannot do so again until after you finish a long rest.

# Bomb Thrower 

Beginning at 5th level, you gain access to the Grenadier feature (page 28) except that you are only able to throw 2 grenades as an action. When you reach 18th level, you may throw 4 grenades as an attack action.

## Deadly Terrain

At 11th level, you can spend a bonus action throwing down a saw-toothed steel ring that snaps shut when a creature steps on a pressure plate in the center. The trap blends in with its surroundings, and a creature requires a Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell save DC to pick it out from the 5 -foot square it rests in. A creature that steps in the same square as the trap must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or be crushed, taking 1d4 bludgeoning and piercing damage per point of proficiency bonus you possess and gaining the restrained condition. A creature can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Each failed check crushes the trapped creature, dealing damage to it. It takes 1 hour to craft a saw-toothed steel ring and you may have a number of these traps on your person equal to your proficiency bonus. Uses of this feature recharge when you have finished a long rest.

## Hide Out Of Place

At 17th level, you become a master of being where eyes are not looking. You are able to hide using Dexterity (Deception) instead of Dexterity (Stealth) and while doing so may hide in plain sight (without any cover or
![img-15.jpeg](assets/Book%20of%20true%20Evil_img-15.jpeg)

# SCIENTIFIC GADGETS 

If a scientific gadget has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it. You can learn the gadget at the same time that you meet its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class. Some warlock eldritch invocations are suitable as scientific gadgets along with those listed here (where a warlock would use Charisma for an eldritch invocation, you use Intelligence.) Spells you cast using a scientific gadget do not require your technological weapon and produce nonmagical effects that are immune to antimagic field, detect magic, dispel magic, and other effects that target spells.

Howling at the high moon and reveling in her bestial form, the werewolf leaps out of the darkness and snatches one of her former pursuers, dragging the screaming man into the shadows and depriving him of his innards with her sharp fangs and claws.

Backing out of the tavern with the merchant lord's gaze locked onto his, the vampire slips into an alleyway nearby, baring his fangs to better slake his thirst on the blood of the foolish man trundling toward him.

Powered by unnatural chemicals, the once living flesh of an abomination refuses to yield against the bail of arrows pelting her form and she charges forward unheeded, slamming into and through a barred door to shatter it into pieces.

Occultists are the dark things that stalk in the night. Empowered by mystical rituals, unnatural science, or otherworldly forces, occultists are thought by most to be monsters, shunned and feared by society. Some seek this power out while others have it foisted upon them, but not all of these individuals are beholden to their base desires and some lead lives that are a boon for a society rather than bane.

## Monstrous Origins

Occultists are the stuff of dark secrecy and fell power, things of legend and forbidden lore. Becoming one of these otherworldly creatures is sometimes the ultimate goal of a cultist, drinking the blood of an existing occultist or engaging in strange rituals to fully realize their power. To others it is a curse bestowed by bloodline or destiny, a burden that strengthens itself through hardship.

## Agents of the Beyond

While there is certainly a predilection for occultists to fall towards evil not all of them give in to unnatural compulsions and darker desires-most are driven there by the angry and misunderstanding societies around them. Many of the fell adventurers that resist their inner natures are raised far from civilization or hidden away from the world in utter secrecy, tainted by otherworldly power inherited from their reclusive parents or bestowed upon them by fate and the workings of cults.

## Creating an Occultist

The first thing to decide when making an occultist is the source of your character's abilities: did they seek out their dark path or was it forced on them by destiny? They might have discovered a dark object or accidentally happened into a nexus of otherworldly energies, stumbling into a ritual or coming upon the decaying essence of a dying monstrous entity looking for a new soul to tether to itself. Perhaps your character has always sought out power regardless of
its source, seeking it out with others in a cult only to be the one that unlocks the secrets of the order. Maybe instead your parents were occultists and in a moment of panic you realized your unnatural inherited talents.

Did you try to hide from society and remain beneath its notice or choose instead to live far from civilized life, surviving in the wilderness? Who-if anyone-knows your truths or helped you keep them secret? Perhaps most importantly, does your character feel scorned by society's treatment of them for their monstrous nature or driven to prove that they are more than their otherworldly appearance suggests?

## CLASS FEATURES

As an occultist, you gain the following class features.

## HIT POINTS

Hit Dice: 1d8 per occultist level
Hit Points at 1st Level: $8+$ your Constitution modifier
Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per occultist level after 1st

## PROFICIENCIES

## Armor: Light armor

Weapons: Simple weapons
Tools: Ceremonial Relics
Saving Throws: Constitution, Charisma
Skills: Choose two from Athletics,
Arcana, Insight, Perception, and Religion

![img-17.jpeg](assets/Book%20of%20true%20Evil_img-17.jpeg)

## Dark Strike

Beginning at 1st level, your strikes are imbued with a darkness that allows you to deal more damage with every blow. For abominations this is a reflection of the chemistry or fell power that drives you onward, for horrors and nightmares it is but a sliver of the unnatural energies at your command, oozes a corrosive grip, and for vampires or werecreatures it is emblematic of sharpening fang or claw.

You gain the following benefits:

- You can use Dexterity or Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes.
- You can roll a d 4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike. This die changes as you gain occultist levels, as shown in the Dark Strike column of the Occultist table.
- When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike on your turn, you can choose to deal necrotic damage by spending a bonus action. You can use Constitution for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strike when dealing necrotic damage.


## Occult Path

At 1st level, your supernatural abilities begin to manifest themselves as an abomination, horror, nightmare, ooze, vampire, or werecreature, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your occult path grants you features at 1 st level and again at 3 rd, 7 th, 11 th, 15 th, and 20 th level.

---

# Supernatural Save 

At 1st level you gain proficiency in a saving throw of your choice. You may change which type of saving throw you gain proficiency in by performing an hour long ritual that requires the use of ceremonial relics. At the end of the ritual make a Charisma check (DC $8+$ your proficiency bonus) and on a success, you may change one type of saving throw proficiency granted by this feature. On a failed check you cannot change the type of saving throw again for one week.

You gain proficiency with an additional type of saving throw at 6th level and again at 11th and 18th level.

The number of attacks increases to three when you reach 13th level in this class.

---

## Toughened Hide

At 10th level, your AC increases by 1 and you gain resistance to one of the following types of damage: bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing. At 14th level and again at 18th level, you gain resistance to another type of weapon damage.

## Darkened Soul

At 17th level, by spending a bonus action you can create an effect identical to the darkness spell, except that this feature requires no components, it cannot be dispelled, and maintaining it does not require your concentration. The darkness you create lasts for a number of rounds equal to your proficiency bonus. Once you have used this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.

## Otherworldly Shadow

At 17th level, you gain resistance to necrotic and psychic damage so long as you consume a specific substance (abomination: electricity damage or alchemical substances, horror or nightmare: another creature's dreams, vampire: blood, werewolf: flesh) each time you take a long rest. At 20th level this improves to immunity to necrotic damage.

## Supernatural Realization

At 20th level, you gain your final occult path ability.

## OCCULT PATHS

The terrible prize of occultists is also the steep price they pay for their power. Once one begins upon an occult path, they are forever and irrevocably changed in both body and soul-the taint of supernatural darkness is eternal, rendering near-certain damnation on the foolhardy that succumb to its promises.

## ABOMINATION

You are a creature of occult science or mystery, incredibly resilient and driven to sentience by forbidden secrets of alchemy, chemistry, or otherworldly energies. Abominations are constructed from the dead parts of other creatures or revived from the remains of a corpse specially prepared with precise rituals.

## Unnatural Threshold

Beginning at 3rd level, choose one type of weapon damage (bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing).

At 7th level, you gain advantage on attack rolls made against objects and deal double damage when using your Strength to damage an object.

## Strange Resistance

Starting at 11th level, choose one type of energy that is not necrotic, poison, or psychic. You gain resistance to this type of energy. Alternatively, you may choose to gain immunity to this type of energy but you also gain vulnerability to another opposed type of energy: acid (lightning), cold (fire), fire (cold), force (psychic), lightning (acid), psychic (force).

---

## Alien Step

Beginning at 11th level, you can spend a bonus action to move through other creatures and objects until the end of your turn. You take 5 (1d10) force damage if you end your turn inside an object. Once you have used this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, you cannot do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

## Compelling Gaze

Starting 15th level, you can spend a bonus action to gaze at a creature within range of your telepathy and affect their mind as if you had cast suggestion except that it does not require any other components or your concentration.

A target can escape the grapple as a bonus action by making a Strength or Dexterity saving throw against a DC equal to $8+$ your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier.

## Malleable Form

Beginning at 7th level, you gain the Grappler feat (if you already have Grappler, choose another feat you meet the prerequisites for) and while you are not wearing any armor or using a shield, your Armor Class equals $10+$ your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier.

In addition, when squeezing through a space large enough for a creature one size smaller than you, you do not suffer any penalties for squeezing. You

---

are able to squeeze through a space large enough for a creature two sizes smaller than you (suffering the normal penalties; spending 1 extra foot for every foot you move, and disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws, and attack rolls against you have advantage while you are in the smaller space).

## Corrosive Form

Starting at 11th level, you can make your body extremely acidic for 1 minute by spending an action. A creature that touches you or hits you with a melee attack while within 5 feet of you takes 1 d 4 acid damage per point of proficiency bonus you possess.

On a failed save, you enter the creature's space, the creature takes 21 (6d6) acid damage, and it is engulfed. The engulfed creature can't breathe, is restrained, and takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of your turns. When you move, the engulfed creature moves with you. An engulfed creature can try to escape by taking an action to make a Strength check (DC $8+$ your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier). On a success, the creature escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of you. You are unable to use Malleable Form while engulfing a creature.

## VAMPIRE

Infused with unholy energies and driven by a thirst for blood, you are slowly becoming a true master of the night and one of the most powerful types of undead.

## Bloodsucker

Starting at 1st level, you can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check. You gain vulnerability to radiant damage; at the GM's discretion, you may choose instead to take an amount of damage equal to your proficiency bonus each turn you are in sunlight. When using Dark Strike to deal energy damage to a living creature (not constructs or undead), you heal 1 d 4 hit points.

## Darkness Form

Beginning at 3rd level, if you aren't in sunlight or running water, you can use an action to polymorph into a Tiny bat or a Medium cloud of mist. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

While in bat form, you can't speak, your walking speed is 5 feet, and you have a flying speed of 30 feet. Your statistics, other than size and speed, are unchanged. Anything you are wearing transforms with you, but nothing you are carrying does.

While in mist form, you can't take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. You are weightless, have a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, you can do so without squeezing, and you can't pass through water. You have advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and you are immune to all nonmagical damage (except for sunlight which deals 10 radiant damage to you each turn).

You can stay in a Darkness Form for a number of hours equal to half your occultist level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.

In addition, you take 20 acid damage when you end your turn in running water regardless of your form.

---

# Charm 

Starting at 7th level, you can spend an action to target one humanoid you can see within 30 feet. If the target can see you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC $8+$ your proficiency bonus + your Charisma bonus) or be charmed by you. The charmed target regards you as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn't under your control, it takes your requests or actions in the most favorable way it can, and it is a willing target for your Dark Strike attack. Each time you or your companions do anything harmful to the target (other than using your Dark Strike), it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until you are destroyed, are on a different plane of existence than the target, or take a bonus action to end the effect. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.

In addition, you can't enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants.

## Children of the Night

Beginning at 11th level, you can spend an action to magically call 1d4 hat swarms or rat swarms, provided that the sun isn't up. While outdoors, you can call 2d6 wolves instead. The called creatures arrive in 1d4 rounds, acting as your allies and obeying your spoken commands. The beasts remain for 1 hour, until you die, or until you dismiss them as a bonus action. Once you have used this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.

When you reach 16th level, you can call 2d4 swarms when indoors or 3d6 wolves outdoors.

## Escaping Mist

Starting at 15th level you establish a resting place and imbue a coffin with unholy power. When you drop to 0 hit points outside its resting place, you transform into a cloud of mist (as in the Darkness Form feature) instead of falling unconscious, provided that you aren't in sunlight or running water. If you can't transform, you are destroyed. While you have 0 hit points in mist form, you can't revert to your normal form, and you must reach your resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed. Once in your resting place, you revert to your normal form. You are paralyzed until you regain at least 1 hit point. After spending 1 hour in your resting place with 0 hit points, you regain 1 hit point.
![img-18.jpeg](assets/Book%20of%20true%20Evil_img-18.jpeg)

In addition, you are damaged by holy water as if you were a fiend or undead.

## Master of the Night

When you reach 20th level, you regain 20 hit points at the start of your turn if you have at least 1 hit point and aren't in sunlight or running water. If you take radiant damage or damage from holy water, this feature doesn't function at the start of your next turn. In addition, your type changes to undead.

## WERECREATURE

You are filled with animalistic fury and cursed with a strange form of lycanthropy that changes you into a beast when the moon hangs high in the sky.

## Lycanthropic Forms

Beginning at 1st level, you can use an action to polymorph into a beast-humanoid hybrid or into a beast (a black bear, boar, giant rat, panther, or wolf; this is chosen when you take this occult path and cannot be changed), or back into your true form. While in hybrid or beast form your AC increases by an amount equal to half your proficiency bonus. Your statistics, other than your AC, are the same in each form. Any equipment you aren't wearing or carrying isn't transformed. You revert to your true form if you die. When the moon is full you cannot assume human form.

You can only use your Dark Strike while in hybrid or beast form.

---

# Keen Senses 

Starting at 3rd level, you gain advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.

## Lycanthropic Hide

Beginning at 7th level, while in hybrid or beast form you gain resistance to any bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical weapons not made with silvered weapons.

## Powerful Leaps

Starting at 11th level, while in hybrid or beast form you quadruple the distance of any jumps you make.

## Improved Lycanthropic Hide

Beginning at 15th level, while in hybrid or beast form you gain immunity to any bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical weapons not made with silvered weapons.

## Master Werecreature

When you reach 20th level, your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4 . Your maximum for those scores is now 24 . Your keen senses, powerful leaps, and improved lycanthropic hide features are all available while you are in human form.

# DARK TRANSPORTATION PRESTIGE CLASS

A loud crack from below sends the doors of the cathedral bursting open, the corpses stacked against it thumping to the floor as *Justitia* flood into the ancient building. *Kiazzara* laughs in her revelry as she hears one of the guards slip on the blood-spattered stairs, falling in a tumble before snapping his neck with a wet thwacking sound. Her bellowing changes to yowls of pain that echo downward with the setting sun and as she expected her body changes, powerful scaled wings sprouting from out of her back. With a whooping bowl she leaps from the steeple and takes flight, the town's high priest wounded, unconscious, but still alive—and in her iron grip.

Rushing between the aisles with stacks of restricted tomes tucked beneath each arm, *Vincesca* rapidly tries to recall where the nearest exit from the library is located as another bolt of frigid cold surges past her shoulder, crisping more of her hair to a fine white. Tired of being chased and confident that her assailant will lose their heart for the chase if threatened, she ducks behind a small cart of books and waits for the foolish scribe to appear; the second he does she leaps like a tiger, slashing at his throat and willing the rakshasa in her spirit to come forth to ward away the magical counterattack sure to come. The apprentice mage backs away and wipes the blood from his brow, grinning triumphantly and pulling a scroll from his robes. With a powerful incantation and complex gesture the parchment turns to ash in his hands but not before a cage of energy materializes around the trespasser—though now it is *Vincesca's* turn to smile, the spell fizzling out as the hunter becomes the hunted.

Pleased with how much drink he's had and prepared to retire for the evening with a full belly, *Gnarbold* lets a touch of the demonic power within him flash across his eyes, tempting a bit of malevolence to reach up from the Abyss and muddle the minds of a group of treasure hunters across the lounge. For a moment it seems to fail and the gnome wonders if he'll have to pay for his ale tonight, but only two of the warriors sit dumbfounded—one begins wandering toward the kitchen and another draws a blade, stabbing his nearest companion. Pandemonium breaks out throughout the establishment and *Gnarbold* wades into the melee, weakly pleading for an end to the violence while forcing his dark will on the combat to singe wounds with its corrosive touch. For a moment the ploy seems to fail but then cries of pain finally pull the bouncer from the door and in the confusion the gnome slips away, untroubled by the bill for yet another sumptuous meal.

Traveling the paths of wickedness and utter damnation mean doom for most but a rare few reach the point of physically changing into something vile, attaining foul apotheosis and transforming into chimerical horrors. Unlike occultists the evolutionary nature of dark transformations is far more drastic and rapid, the lust for power channeling the energies needed to remake a body into a more vile form. Undergoing this vile pursuit is the sole purvey of the malicious or the mad, driving them forward when any sane mind would realize the terrible permanent consequences of their actions-an urge to finish the work outweighing any obstacles between them and the potent components needed for their change. Once someone has started down this road there can be no turning back and they embrace their worst selves, eventually assuming their new form as well as the life that comes with it.

## Dark Ritual

In addition to the prerequisites for the prestige class, each dark transformation also requires a specialized ritual as part of the transformation process. This ritual must be completed by the time the character wishes to take a level in the dark transformation prestige class. Each aspect of the transformation has a suggested ritual (usually a small quest) and their specifics are at the GM's discretion (using the sample rituals as guidelines).

A dark ritual may require an aspect ability check (ceremonial relics) against a DC of $8+$ the dark transformation prestige class level the character is about to take. On a failure the character gains the vilespawn template (page 147) as their level instead, although they may continue taking levels in this prestige class afterward. If vilespawn character has already achieved a level with the lich aspect dark transformation, their aspect ability changes to Wisdom or Charisma (whichever is higher). Unlike normal vilespawn, the creature does not lose its most recent level or any of its memories.

## PREREQUISITES

The dark transformation prestige class is available to any character that meets the prerequisites, determined by the chosen transformation aspect (see below). Taking levels in the dark transformation prestige class follows the same rules as multiclassing except where noted.

# Transformation Aspect 

When you choose to take this prestige class you choose a transformation aspect, which describes your desired dark transformation: abyssal, dragon, infernal, golem, lich, or rakshasa (each detailed at the end of the class description). Each transformation aspect has its own aspect ability (much like a cleric's spellcasting ability of Wisdom or a sorcerer's spellcasting ability of Charisma) that determines the bonuses granted by your transformation features.

## Aspect Ability

These aspects are tied to a particular ability score known as your aspect ability. Your chosen aspect and relevant aspect ability determine how your various dark transformation features manifest. You use your aspect ability modifier when setting the saving throw DC for any aspect powers you use and when making an attack roll with one (unless specified otherwise). If a feature granted by your dark transformation requires a saving throw, the saving throw DC is equal to $8 \cdot$ your proficiency bonus + your aspect ability modifier.

## Aspect Resistance

At 1st level, you gain resistance to a type of damage. At 5th level, you gain resistance to a second type of damage.

## Aspect Attack

At 2nd level, you gain a special attack. You are proficient with this attack.

## Aspect Power

At 3rd level, you gain an aspect power. You gain more potent aspect powers at 5th level and 7th level.

## Aspect Empowerment

At 4th level, your transformation empowers either your body or mind and you can increase your aspect ability by 2 . As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. If this increase would increase your aspect ability above 20, you instead increase your aspect ability to 20 and use the leftover increase to increase any other ability score or scores.

## Dark Fortification

At 6th level, you can call upon the power of your aspect to assist you for a number of rounds equal to your aspect ability modifier. Once you have used this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.

## Dark Apotheosis

At 8th level, you complete your dark transformation and gain additional aspect power.

## TRANSFORMATION ASPECTS

When you take levels in this prestige class, you choose a dark transformation aspect that you manifest. Once selected, you may not choose another dark transformation aspect until you have achieved dark apotheosis with your first choice. Although these aspects are the most common, this not an exhaustive list and the possibility exists for other dark transformations not included here. Prerequisite feats can be found on pages 78-84.

## ABYSSAL ASPECT

Those that undergo the transformation into an abyssal creature typically live a life of sin. These individuals focus on a particular sin and follow it as their main motivator or objective in their everyday lives. As part of their dark transformation, they do their best to tempt others to fall to their sin, drawing upon the envy, gluttony, greed, lust, mendacity, pride, slothfulness, and wrath of others to fuel their rituals. Upon completion of their dark transformation, they may take on the appearance of a fiend tied to their particular sin, such as a succubus for the lustful or an abrikandilu for the wrathful.

Prerequisites. Wisdom 15 or higher, Abyssal Attunement or Abyssal Experiment.
Dark Ritual. Take the life of an intelligent humanoid steeped in a particular habitual sin (such as greed or wrath). Bathe in the sinful blood and do not clean yourself of the gore for at least one week.

extra set of arms, a set of wings, or a tail, and you gain proficiency with a slam natural attack using your new augmentation. Whenever you take the Attack action on your turn, you can make an extra slam melee attack that deals 1 d 6 bludgeoning damage plus your Strength modifier.

This demonic gem allows you to cast magic jar as an action with the gem serving as your material component. You can possess a creature with this feature for a number of hours equal to your Wisdom modifier. Once you have used this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.

# DRAGON ASPECT 

Creatures that undergo a draconic transformation tend to feel the might of dragons constantly stirring in their hearts-the urge to wield it over others roiling in their blood constantly yearning for release. Only the most powerful are able to tap into this might let alone change themselves into dragons. These creatures show draconic tendencies even before undertaking the grand endeavor of a dark transformation, saving their coin or proving themselves as intellectually superior whenever possible. Once they reach their apotheosis, they resemble young versions of their draconic kin, eventually evolving into full dragons over centuries. Prerequisites. Strength 15 or higher, Draconic Attunement feat.
Dark Ritual. Gather the bones of an adult dragon of any type or at least three young dragons of the type chosen with the Draconic Attunement feat. Shatter the bones into small shards and drive them into your skin in a ritual spanning one week (dealing 1d6 piercing damage each day; this damage cannot be healed by magic).

## Dragon Transformation Features

When undergoing a dragon transformation, your features manifest in the following ways.
Aspect Ability. Strength.
Aspect Resistance: Dragonscale. You gain resistance to the damage type of the dragon chosen with the Draconic Attunement feat (black—acid, bluelightning, green—poison, red-fire, vile—necrotic, white-cold). When you reach 5th level in this prestige class, you gain resistance to either bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage.

Your bite attack's damage increases to 1 d 6 when you reach character level 9th, 1d8 at 13th, and 1d10 at 17th. Minor Aspect Power: Wyrm Glare. Your guise grows more fearsome. As a bonus action, you can instill fear into your enemies. One creature of your choice that is within 30 feet of you and aware of you must make a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at
the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once you have used this feature against a creature, the creature is immune to it for the next 24 hours.
Moderate Aspect Power: Breath Weapon. You gain a breath weapon which you can use as an action. The breath weapon functions as a dragonborn's breath weapon, except your draconic ancestry is determined by the dragon type chosen with the Draconic Attunement feat. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

If you are a dragonborn, you can use your breath weapon twice before completing a short or long rest and can use the breath weapon of either your draconic ancestry or the type chosen with the Draconic Attunement feat.
Dark Fortification: Wyrmscale. As a bonus action, you urge forth draconic might that makes your natural resistances grow stronger. You gain immunity to the damage type determined by the Draconic Attunement feat or resistance to either bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage.
Major Aspect Power: Dragon Strike. You are able to tap into the vestiges of great serpents swimming in your blood. As a bonus action, you can call upon this might. When you make a melee attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll equal to your proficiency bonus for 1 minute. Once you have used this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
Dark Apotheosis: Dragon. You gain a set of wings which allow you to fly either at your speed or at a rate of 40 feet, whichever is faster. As an action, you can beat your wings. Each creature within 10 feet of you must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take (2d6) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone.

## INFERNAL ASPECT

Infernally attuned creatures are deceitful-they are the liars, cheats, and traitors of the world-and they savor every moment of their duplicity. Even at a young age they may find themselves fooling friends into entering unfair agreements, but once they learn of the power of Hell and infernal contracts (typically by entering a contract themselves) they usually see another means of establishing power or control over others. When transformed they are least likely to manifest significant physical changes to better allow for further deceptions, though the depths of their depravity are no less significant.

---

Prerequisites. Charisma 15 or higher, Infernal Attunement feat or Infernal Experiment feat. Dark Ritual. Submit a soul, either your own or that of another, via an infernal contract. The contract must include a clause which submits the soul as payment upon the completion of your dark transformation and must be written in the blood of an innocent intelligent humanoid.

Moderate Aspect Power: Hellfire. You gain the ability to summon forth hellfire and hurl it as an action. The range of your hellfire is 100 feet and on a successful hit, you deal 3d6 fire damage + your Charisma modifier. If your target is a flammable object that isn't being worn or carried, it also catches fire.
Dark Fortification: Infernal Power. As a bonus action, your body grows with infernal energy. You increase in size as the enlarge/reduce spell. While this feature is active your attacks deal an additional 1d6 points of fire damage.
Major Aspect Power: Binding Contracts. As an action, you can strike a short-term bargain with a creature able to see, hear, and understand you. This creature is bound by your binding contract unless it makes a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a bound creature must focus any attacks or spells solely on you (including abilities that target an area) or a fragment of its soul is ripped away. A bound creature that attacks or targets anything other than you (failing on its end of the bargain) is wracked with pain and takes 4 d 10 points of psychic damage at the end of its turn.

A creature is bound by this contract for 1 minute but can repeat the Charisma saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to your binding contracts for the next 24 hours. You may end a binding contract at any time as a bonus action, dealing 6 d 10 points of psychic damage to the bound creature. You can only maintain one binding contract at a time. If you strike a binding contract with a nother creature, your previous binding contract immediately ends without damaging its bound creature.
Dark Apotheosis: Devil. You gain immunity to fire. As a bonus action, you can wreathe yourself in hellfire. All creatures that begin their turn adjacent to you take 4 d 6 points of fire damage from this hellfire unless they make a Dexterity saving throw. You can dismiss this hellfire as a reaction.

In addition, you gain telepathy to a range of 60 feet.
![img-20.jpeg](assets/Book%20of%20true%20Evil_img-20.jpeg)

## GOLEM

Those that seek to transform into golems rarely feel content with their own bodies. It might start as a simple displeasure of one's hair type or eye color but these feelings evolve into an obsession over flaws, constantly being uncomfortable, or repulsion of specific body parts (or one's entire body). These individuals seek to reshape their body, replacing flesh and organs with manufactured pieces or those stolen from others. Upon a complete dark transformation, they may not have any piece of their original body remaining, leaving only the mind and soul intact to continue the will of physical change.
Prerequisites. Constitution 15 or higher, Promethean Attunement feat.
Dark Ritual. Replace at least one-third of your major body parts with that of a construct or another humanoid (see the graft flesh chirurgical procedure on page 85 and grafting feats on pages 71-75). At least one of transplanted parts must come from a living creature.

Minor Aspect Power: Heavy Blood. Your body is extremely hardy. You add half of your Constitution modifier again when increasing your hit point maximum when you gain a level. You retroactively gain hit points for your previous levels when you gain this feature.
Moderate Aspect Power: Segmented Mind. When you fail an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw, you may use your reaction to block off that portion of your mind at the cost of going berserk. You treat the saving throw as if you had succeeded, but you go berserk for a number of rounds equal to your Constitution modifier. While you are berserk, at the start of each round you move towards and attack the nearest creature you can see. If no creature is near enough to move to and attack, you attack an object, with preference for an object smaller than yourself. At the end of every round you can make a Wisdom saving throw to regain your composure. While berserk you cannot use this feature (raging does not interfere with segmented mind). If you are able to cast spells, while berserk you cannot cast spells or concentrate on them.
Dark Fortification: Golem Fortitude. As a bonus action, your body grows extremely resilient. You gain resistance to all damage except necrotic, psychic, and radiant damage.
Major Aspect Power: Self-Repair. As a bonus action, your body reconstitutes and repairs damage to itself at an accelerated rate.

Once you have used this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.
Dark Apotheosis: Golem. You become a true construct and no longer need to eat, breathe, or sleep. You have advantage on all Constitution checks and saving throws, and you have advantage on all saving throws against spells or magical effects.

## LICH

A person obsessed with becoming a lich may be consumed with a hunger for more powerful magic or to attain immortality. The threat of a mundane life or death is anathema to such an individual. These mages and mystics tend to live isolated lives, spending all their waking hours studying the lore of undeath's masters. Intensive research over hundreds and thousands of hours take a toll on their bodies, leaving gaunt and sickly figures akin to a corpse. Upon the end of their dark transformation, the spellcaster completes their goal, becoming something fully versed in arcana and beyond death. Though they resemble liches in nature, even after their dramatic change these creatures must still spend decades before learning the secrets of phylacteries and complete lichdom.
Prerequisites. Intelligence 15 or higher, Undead Attunement feat, ability to cast arcane spells. Dark Ritual. Tie off blood flow to one of your extremities until it undergoes necrosis, then revitalize and restore animation to the limb with a smaller ritual that takes place over one day. Complete this process for all of your major extremities.

## Lich Transformation Features

When undergoing a lich transformation, your features manifest in the following ways.
Aspect Ability. Intelligence.
Aspect Resistance: Blasphemous Bones. You gain resistance to necrotic damage. At 5th level, you gain resistance to either cold, lightning, or poison damage. Aspect Attack: Paralyzing Touch. You gain a paralyzing touch. You can attempt to touch a creature within reach as a bonus action. You use either your Dexterity or your Intelligence for the attack roll.

The length of the paralysis increases by 1 round when you reach character level 9 th, 13th, and 17th (maximum 4 rounds). A paralyzed creature can repeat the saving throw at

You can use this feature twice between long rests starting at 9th level, three times between long rests starting at 13th level, and four times between long rests starting at 17th level.
Moderate Aspect Power: Gaze of Unlife. Your gaze gains the power to instill fear in your enemies. As an action, you can fix your gaze on one creature you can see within 100 feet.

The frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once you

You can use this feature twice between long rests starting at 13th level and three times between long rests starting at 17th level.
Dark Apotheosis: Lich. You become a true undead and no longer need to eat, breathe, or sleep. A burst of necrotic energy pulses out from you when you cast a spell of 6th-level or higher. Each living creature within 15 feet must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 4 d 6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful save.

# RAKSHASA 

The rakshasa-blooded are manipulators, setting forth subtle machinations requiring months or even years of execution. Although they pride themselves on their guile these individuals are also masters of the sudden, dangerous strike-they jump at opportunities as they present themselves and remake circumstances to be favorable again when they do not. With their full dark transformation, they usually fulfill a long-standing plan. Their appearance changes to match that of other rakshasa and usually resembles an anthropomorphic tiger, but avian or reptilian forms are not uncommon. Prerequisites. Dexterity 15 or higher, Asuran Attunement feat.
Dark Ritual. You receive a ritualistic tattoo using the bone of an enemy as the needle in an extremely painful procedure that takes a full week ( 8 hours of tattooing on each day) to complete.

Minor Aspect Power: Invasive Mind. You gain the ability to innately cast detect thoughts on a creature as an action. You can cast this spell at will. Once you have used this feature against a creature, it is immune to invasive mind for 24 hours.

In addition, once between long rests you can innately cast dominate person without the need for concentration.

## EVIL CLASS ARCHETYPES

Throughout these archetypes you'll find ${ }^{\mathrm{v}}$ citations on several spells to indicate that they are included elsewhere in this book (Chapter 9: Vile Spells). Unless otherwise noted, these archetypes are intended for evil characters or villainous NPCs. At the GM's discretion, a character with levels in an evil archetype may have to choose a new archetype or class should their alignment change to good.

# ABYSSAL CLERIC DOMAIN 

You have pledged your devotion to one of the greater fiends of the Abyss, drawing on a demon for your divine powers. There are many different lords in the unfettered realm of primeval chaos but they all share the same conduit upon which other hidden adherents like yourself draw power, granting similar abilities that serve devotees well when visiting a master's home.

## Bonus Proficiency

When you choose this domain at 1st level, you learn Abyssal and gain proficiency with ceremonial relics.

Domain Spells

| Cleric Level | Spells |
| :--: | :-- |
| 1st | flay skin ${ }^{\mathrm{V}}$, bellish rebuke |
| 3rd | invisibility, scorching ray |
| 5th | fear, vampiric touch |
| 7th | confusion, greater invisibility |
| 9th | contagion, sanguine razorstorm |

## Demon-Touched

Also starting at 1st level, you are empowered by dark entities in the Abyss. Each time you finish a long rest, you can choose to gain either fire resistance or poison resistance. This resistance lasts until the next time you finish a long rest.

## Channel Divinity: Aether of the Abyss

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to conjure forth miasma from the Abyss. As an action, you present your unholy symbol and summon tendrils of evil that reach out and grasp at creatures you choose within 30 feet, forcing them to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or suffer from confusion (as the spell) for a number of rounds equal to half your proficiency bonus.

## Abyssal Allies

Beginning at 6th level, you learn find familiar and can cast it to summon a Quasit. Unlike normal your quasit familiar is able to take the Attack action, and you may simultaneously keep a number of quasit familiars equal to half your proficiency bonus (although each requires its own casting of the spell). In addition, your quasits add your proficiency bonus to melee weapon damage rolls.

## Unholy Minions

At 17th level, your quasits gain a bonus to attack rolls and weapon damage rolls equal to your Wisdom modifier.

## CHIRURGEON ARCANE TRADITION

There are wizards that choose to carefully study and analyze not only magic but the workings of the physical body as well. You are one such chirurgeon and feared by your adversaries, known to employ devious plans that intricately weave together spells and diabolical surgeries to enact your will upon a subject, completely transforming creatures into other forms or powerfully warped abominations.

## Chirurgeon Training

Starting at 2nd level, you gain proficiency in Medicine and thieves' tools, and you are able to use Intelligence instead of Wisdom when using Medicine. If you have or gain proficiency in Medicine from another source, your proficiency bonus doubles on checks using Medicine.

---

# Master Chirurgeon

The time it takes you to perform a lengthy chirurgical procedure is reduced by a number of hours equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1 hour). In addition, you finish building a dissectrinator (page 150). Your dissectrinator can be controlled with bonus actions (to attack a target you point to but otherwise as though it were under the constant effects of the command spell).

## CIRCLE OF NECROBOTANY

To some reanimators the contrast between living and undead is not so stark. You are among those who answer the call of the wild with the chill apparitions of the dead as well, reinforcing your undead creations with plants to interweaving life with death in your abominations to raise truly deadly creatures.

Circle Spells

| Druid Level | Circle Spells |
| :--: | :-- |
| 3rd | gentle repose, <br> ray of enfcchlement |

When it hits the decrepit pod spreads into a 20 -foot-radius sphere of pollen. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. It lasts for the duration or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it. Any creature other than you that ends its turn inside of the pollen makes a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or gains the poisoned condition for 1 round. Once you have used this feature a number of times equal to $1+$ your Wisdom modifier, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.

## Vined Monstrosities

Starting at 10th level, undead you create can be made with additional limbs of tentacle-like vines. You may create a number of additional vine limbs for your undead equal to your Wisdom modifier. An undead may only have as many additional limbs as its proficiency bonus. A vine limb grants an undead one extra attack when it takes the attack action (a slam that deals $1 \mathrm{~d} 6+$ Strength modifier bludgeoning damage with a reach increased by 5 feet). You may only have one vined monstrosity at a time.

## Necroplant

At 14th level, you learn to craft an undead creature woven with greenery so complex that it is as durable as flesh. With one day of work and concentration you can create a necroplant with statistics identical to a Flesh Golem. You may only have a single necroplant at one time.

## INFERNAL CLERIC DOMAIN

Some believe that through worship they might gain advantage in striking an infernal bargain, devoting their lives to drawing as many souls down into Hell alongside them as possible. You have entreated the foulest creatures of Hell with your faith, becoming a true adherent to a lord devil in Hell in exchange for dark powers so that you might bring others to befall your fate.

Domain Spells

| Cleric <br> Level | Spells |
| :--: | :-- |
| 1st | bellish rebuke, protection from evil and good |
| 3rd | alter self, suggestion |
| 5th | bestow curse, speak with dead |
| 7th | locate creature, polymorph |
| 9th | dispel evil and good (good only), dominate person |

## Bonus Proficiency

When you choose this domain at 1st level, you learn Infernal and gain proficiency with ceremonial relics.

## Infernal Blessing

Also at 1st level, you have advantage on saving throws to resist the charmed condition and you gain resistance to fire.

## Fires of Hell

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to unleash the flames of Hell. As an action, you present your unholy symbol and evoke infernal energy that roils outward from you, dealing 1 d 8 damage per point of proficiency bonus you possess to all creatures within 30 feet. Half of this damage is fire and half is necrotic. A successful Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC halves this damage.

## Infernal Allies

Beginning at 6th level, you learn find familiar and can cast it to summon an Imp. Unlike normal, your imp familiar is able to take the Attack action without requiring you to spend your action for it to do so and you may simultaneously keep a number of imp familiars equal to half your proficiency bonus (although each requires its own casting of the spell). In addition, your imps increase the range of their critical hits by an amount equal to half your proficiency bonus (at 6th level they score a critical hit on 19-20, at 9th level they score a critical hit on 18-20, and at 17th level they score a critical hit on 17-20).

## Devilish Skin

Starting at 8th level, you grow a layer of infernal flesh just beneath your skin. After you take damage or deal damage with a spell the unholy meat just under the surface bubbles up, turning you red and increasing your AC by 2 until 1 minute after combat ends.

## Infernal Flames

At 17th level, the touch of Hell has become a complete embrace. You are always surrounded by crimson flames that grant you immunity to fire damage. Whenever a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, the flames lick out and the attacker takes 2 d 8 fire damage. You may suppress or reactivate this feature by spending a bonus action.

# FEARMONGER (Sorcerer Bloodline) 

Terror has great power for those willing to use it, turning horror itself into a weapon. Fearmongers are masters of their craft and able to strike dread in the hearts of even the bravest souls, manipulating their enemies to cowardice through dark magic that most mages are too afraid to seek out.

## Frightful Gaze

Starting when you choose this bloodline at 1st level, when a creature that can see your eyes starts its turn within 30 feet of you, you can spend your bonus action or reaction to force it to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC if you aren't incapacitated and can see the creature. If the saving throw fails, the creature is frightened for a number of rounds equal to your proficiency bonus.

Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw from your Frightful Gaze at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see you until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at you in the meantime, you may spend your reaction to cause it to immediately make the save. You can use this feature a number of times equal to $1+$ your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.

## True Terror

Beginning at 6th level, your features and spells that cause the frightened condition are able to affect creatures that would otherwise not know fear. Targets that normally have advantage on saving throws against fear effects do not gain advantage against when making saving throws to avoid being frightened by you. In addition, by spending 1 sorcerery point when a creature that is normally immune to fear is targeted by a feature or spell that would make it frightened of you, it loses its immunity but gains advantage on its saving throw.

## Aura of Fear

At 14th level, each creature of your choice that is within 60 feet of you and aware of you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to your Aura of Fear for the next 24 hours.

## Thing of Horror

Starting at 18th level, you no longer require a sorcery point to use True Terror to force fear onto immune creatures. Other creatures are at disadvantage when making saving throws against your fear (if it would normally have advantage, it rolls without advantage instead).

## FERAL RAGER PRIMAL PATH

Within every intelligent humanoid resides the ancient bloodline of a more primal creature. By embracing savagery and committing your bloodlust to dark powers you have unleashed a bestial thing from far back in time, something inside yourself made all the more brutal by the touch of prehistoric evil.

## Dark Claws

Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, wicked claws erupt from your fingertips for the duration of your rage. Your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 slashing damage, count as magical, and grant half your Rage damage bonus to attack rolls. In addition, when you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike on your turn you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action.

## Primal Senses

Beginning at 6th level, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell. When raging, at the start of your turn you automatically detect the squares occupied by invisible creatures within 30 feet.

## Feral Charge

At 10th level, when you move at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hit it with an unarmed strike on the same turn, that target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC $8+$ your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier). On a failure the target is knocked prone and provokes an opportunity attack from you.

In addition, with a 10 -foot running start you can long jump up to 25 feet.

## Wicked Serrations

Starting at 14th level, you are able to deploy or retract your Dark Claws as a bonus action even when you are not raging, and while raging they form merciless

---

jagged edges weeping with evil energies that deal 2d6 necrotic damage. On a successful hit with your Dark Claws, you regain an amount of hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt to the target of your attack.

## GRUESOME SALVAGER (Ranger Archetype)

Whereas most individuals grafted with the parts of monsters or other races are not willing to accept their new limbs and appendages, you actively pursue creatures to incorporate into your own body as a rite of passage. For your efforts you have been endowed by grisly transformations with powers that make you a terror to behold on the battlefield.

## Unholy Experiment

Starting when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain either the Abyssal Experiment feat or the Infernal Experiment feat.

## Grafted Warrior

At 7th level and 11th level, you gain one grafting feat that you qualify for.

## Extra Attack

At at 11th level, you can attack three times, instead of twice, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

## Truly Gruesome

At 15th level, you gain two grafting feats. You do not require any of the prerequisites for these feats.

## GRAY KNIGHT (Warlock Patron)

The Gray Knight is a potent being dedicated entirely to maintaining balance-what has occurred on this burgeoning planet cannot be allowed to stand. The mysterious figure has imparted some of zir power to you and other agents in Askis so that true order might yet be restored.

Pact of the Blade. Your pact weapon might be a fearsome greatsword similar to the weapon wielded by the true ephemeral Gray Knight.
Pact of the Chain. Your familiar is as inscrutable and stubborn as your grim patron, likely taking the shape of a cat or goat.
Pact of the Tome. Your Book of Shadows is an unassuming dark gray grimoire with edges lined by battered, dull metal.

## Psipoints

Gray Knights do not gain expanded spells. Instead at 1st level, 3rd level, and every odd warlock level thereafter, you gain 1 psipoint (up to a maximum of 10 psipoints at 19 th level). Whenever you encounter an active spell that has been cast within the last week, you may expend 1 psipoint as an action to negate the spell. When you witness a creature within 50 feet casting a spell, you may expend 1 psipoint as a reaction to negate the spell. A spell you negate must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the Warlock table's Slot Level column for your level. When you attempt to negate a spell higher than your Slot Level, it is not negated but you gain advantage on saving throws to resist it or the caster is at disadvantage on its spell attack roll. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended psipoints.

## Gray Armor

Starting at 1st level, you can spend a bonus action to summon spirits that sigh and enshroud you in translucent gray spectral armor. While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals $10+$ your Dexterity modifier + your Charisma modifier. You cannot use a shield and still gain this benefit.

## Enshrouded Mind

Beginning at 6th level, your mind expands as your psyche obscures itself. You gain resistance to psychic damage and immunity to the charmed condition. When a creature targets you with a spell that would cause you to be charmed, it makes a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC or becomes confused (as the spell) for 1 round.

## Psychic Attunement

At 10th level, you have become attuned to the workings of magic nearby and have learned how to react to the arcane and divine without thinking. Creatures that are within your reach provoke an opportunity attack from you when they cast a spell. In addition, enemies within your reach are at disadvantage on checks made to maintain concentration of a spell.

## Gray Strike

Starting at 14th level, when you hit a creature with an attack, you can use this feature to cut off the target's access to magic. For a number of rounds equal to half your proficiency bonus, the creature is targeted by an

---

effect that functions as the antimagic field spell except that its range is reduced to touch and it has no radius (affecting only the creature). On its turn, a creature targeted by this feature can spend its action to make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC to end the effect.

Once you have used this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.

# CIRCLE OF GRAY 

The Gray Knight has an intense relationship to nature, seeking out those endowed with a connection to fauna and flora to become zir agents for balancepeople with a natural understanding. You are a druid exceptional at fighting mages and priests, disrupting magic with every swipe of your shapeshifted limbs.

## Expanded Mind

Starting when you choose this circle at 2nd level, your mind expands. You gain telepathy to a range of 10 feet per point

## Circle Spells

| Druid | Spells |
| :--: | :--: |
| 3rd | detect thoughts, silence |
| 5th | counterspell, dispel magic |
| 7th | arcane eye, resilient sphere |
| 9th | commune, dispel evil and good |

of proficiency bonus you possess. Unlike normal telepathy, you can send and receive images, able to primitively communicate with other creatures even if you do not have a shared language.

In addition, you can spend a bonus action overloading the mind of a creature within range of your telepathy, and until the start of your next turn it has disadvantage on checks made to maintain concentration of a spell. Once you have used this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier, you can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

## Disruptive Wild Shape

Beginning at 6th level, while using Wild Shape any creature within your reach that casts a spell triggers an opportunity attack from you. When you deal damage to a creature while using Wild Shape, until the start of your next turn the target has disadvantage on checks made to maintain concentration of a spell.

## Powerful Disruptions

Starting at 10th, when you cast counterspell or dispel magic it is always treated as 1 spell slot level higher regardless of the spell slot you used to cast it. For
example, when you cast counterspell as a 4th-level spell it counts as a 5th-level counterspell.

## Sublime Disruptions

Beginning at 14th level, you are able to cast counterspell and dispel magic while using Wild Shape.

## OATH OF HERESY

The Oath of Heresy is a path that few have the strength to walk. Sometimes known as heresy knights, blackguards, or scourges (and many other, fouler names in less polite company), these paladins set themselves against everything that modern Askis stands for. From the pure and the good, to the extravagant glory of righteousness, heresy knights exist to befoul the world, tear it down, and erect a new, blighted one in its place. Whether wronged by holy agents, sworn to a dark god, or simply born cursed, you have accepted the Oath of Heresy and taken up arms against the celestial forces and all they stand for.

---

Those who take up this oath come from many different walks of life. An inherent sense of order helps them work with single-minded determination, but there are still others who enjoy corruption and destruction for their own sake, as well as a significant minority that just wish to see the world burn. The armor and heraldry of your order vary greatly as well, though bones, scythes, and the features of evil outsiders are common, as well as images of broken chains.

## Tenets of Heresy

The specific tenets of the Oath of Heresy vary among its members, but all have a general focus on desecration, destruction, and befoulment. Paladins who follow this path seek to embody these ideals, becoming a living wound in the heaven-touched world of Askis and spreading their infection wherever possible.

- Destruction. It is not enough to assault the minds and morals of those who follow the light. Their monuments must topple and their champions ground underfoot. Work through proxies if you must, but evil is best served by those who use their own hands.
- Perversion. There is no virtue that cannot be turned in upon itself and corrupted. Enact this wherever possible, in both word and deed.
- Practicality. Never let your own code stand in the way of striking a blow against heaven. Likewise, do not indulge in meaningless destruction when a proper target is present.
- Putrefaction. Remember that you are an agent of darkness in a world of light; your very presence corrupts the world and sets it rotting. Do not carelessly throw away your life or that of those you have corrupted.


## Channel Divinity

When you take this oath at 3rd level you gain the following two Channel Divinity options:

Ensnarling Heresy. As an action, you present your holy symbol, turning your heretical words into tangible dark coils using your Channel Divinity. You can focus the force of your blasphemy on a creature within 10 feet of you that you can see. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be restrained. While restrained by the

60 tendrils, the creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, it frees itself and the coils disappear.

Oath of Heresy Spells

| Paladin <br> Level | Spells |
| :--: | :-- |
| 3rd | flay skin $^{V}$, lesser inscribe vilespeech ${ }^{V}$ |
| 5th | bone spurs $^{V}$, ray of enfeeblement |
| 9th | blasphemous influence $^{V}$, inscribe Vilespeech ${ }^{V}$ |
| 13th | blight, forced hemorrhage $^{V}$ |
| 17th | awaken heresy $^{V}$, dispel evil and good (good only) |

Putrefying Strike. You can use your Channel Divinity to lend your weapon some of your own blighted nature. As a bonus action, you touch one weapon or piece of ammunition and coat it with an oily film. This substance lasts for 1 minute. The next time you hit a target with an attack using that weapon or ammunition the target takes necrotic damage in addition to the attack. This damage equals $2 \mathrm{~d} 10+$ your paladin level.

## Aura of Darkness

Beginning at 7th level, the miasma of evil enshrouding you obscures the vision of your enemies. You and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you benefit as though you have half cover from ranged attacks ( +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws).

At 18th level, the aura's radius increases to 15 feet and now provides three-quarters cover from ranged attacks ( +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws) and half cover from melee attacks.

## Fight Another Day

At 15 th level, you gain the ability to judiciously retreat. Immediately after you are hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to wrap yourself in a dark mist and teleport up to 60 feet to a spot you can see. This mist grants you full cover against your enemies (but not friendly creatures) until the end of your next turn, or until you attack, deal damage, or force a creature to make a saving throw. Once you have used this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

## Scion of Corruption

At 20th level you can become an embodiment of your own evil ideals, taking on an appearance you choose. You may take on a fiendish aspect, growing scales or horns, become gaunt and skeletal, gain a terrifying

---

beauty, or any other number of blasphemous features. Using your action, you undergo this heretical transformation. For 1 minute your Aura of Darkness grows in size and power. Creatures that begin their turn within 30 feet of you take 10 necrotic damage, and creatures that begin their turn within 10 feet of you gain one level of exhaustion. You may choose a number of creatures equal to your proficiency bonus to be immune to this feature when activated.

Once you have used this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.

## MASQUERADING HERETIC (Rogue)

The most effective wounds to the bureaucracy of the Celestial Heroes that rule over the world will be dealt by those within the gargantuan establishment, agents of evil able to operate from the inside. Your talents are concentrated upon maintaining this deception, staying one step ahead of the zealots seeking out evil in the world as you sabotage the apparatuses that make it function.

## Natural Liar

Beginning when you choose this rogue archetype at 3rd level, you may use your Cunning Action to draw upon dark inspiration that grants you advantage on a Charisma (Deception) or Charisma (Persuasion) check. You can use this feature a number of times equal to $1+$ your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.

## Obscured Nature

Also at 3rd level, you gain a fundamental understanding of the pliability of soul and you can shape your essence in such a way that it slips past the senses of divine creatures and magic. By spending your reaction and 1 vilis point you may be treated by one known effect or spell (such as protection from good or evil or when first interacting with an inaequa device) as though you were an unaligned creature.

In addition, while your actual Sin and Sanctity scores do not change, to the perception of others and for the purposes of detection spells they
appear to be switched (so your Sin score appears to have your Sanctity score's value and likewise).

## Implacable Will

Starting at 9th level, your mind becomes a devious steel trap impossible to pry open. You are immune to the effects of detect thoughts and the charmed condition.

In addition, when creatures attempt to charm you their spell or effect appears to function normally (making it seem as though you have been successfully charmed).

## Undetectable

Beginning at 13th level, your soul becomes as stealthy as the void itself. You are under the constant effects of the nondetection spell. You may suppress or reactivate this feature as a free action even while incapacitated.

## Despicable Strike

At 17th level, you can tap into the worst aspects of existence to deliver a horrendous strike able to sever your target's connection to arcana or divine power. When you hit a creature and deal Sneak Attack damage, you can spend 1 vilis point to force it to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC $8+$ your Sin modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failure the target loses all magical features and spellcasting it possesses for 6 rounds. Any arcane magic items or spells currently affecting the target function normally but divine-based magic dissipates.

## COLLEGE OF ANARCHY

Bards of the College of Anarchy are commonly known as malcontents or silvertongues, known for using their mastery of word and song to control the minds of others. They can be found (with difficulty) in every social strata of Askis whispering poison in the ears of nobility, whipping a crowd into a hateful frenzy, and generally twisting emotions to their own purposes. Whatever their goal malcontents are most in control and at home in urban settings where there are plenty of sentient minds to bend to their will, crowds to disappear into, and gossip circles aplenty are ripe for exploitation.

Largely considered a myth among most bards of Askis, the College of Anarchy has thrived in the shadows of civilization's rise. Unlike some morally-

---

bankrupt bards-who use the positive reputation of their profession to its best advantage-you find that they are better served by not presenting as bards at all. The cupbearer at a duchess' table, the sympathetic barkeep in the slums, or the pious clergy member collecting for the poor could all be your means planting the seeds of hate and corruption. From the lowly stations you and the other children of anarchy pretend to keep, you spur violence and discontent using the crowds of cities to spread chaos before slipping away in the confusion that follows.

# Bardic Manipulation 

When you join the College of Anarchy at 3rd level, you learn to manipulate the emotions of others through nonverbal cues and intoned subtleties. You may spend a Bardic Inspiration die as a bonus action to gain advantage to your next Charisma (Deception), Charisma (Persuasion), or Wisdom (Insight) check, or to gain advantage on any Charisma ability check made against a crowd ( 5 or more simultaneous targets).

## Emulate Proficiency

Also at 3rd level, you become a master of mimicry. As an action you can observe another creature for 1 minute and emulate it, utilizing talents that normally require dedication and work to attain. You spend one Bardic Inspiration die to gain proficiency in something for a number of hours equal to your proficiency bonus (or bard level so long as you are within sight of someone else that has and is using that proficiency). For example, you might use this feature to copy a driver's vehicles (land) proficiency
![img-24.jpeg](assets/Book%20of%20true%20Evil_img-24.jpeg)

---

# Stoke the Fires 

At 6th level, you discover how to incite adrenaline with carefully chosen words and a dash of zeal. You may spend your bonus action and two bardic inspiration die to command an adjacent ally, allowing that target to spend its reaction to immediately take an action. By spending an additional Bardic Inspiration die and your reaction, you may choose any ally that you can see instead.

## Herder of Sheep

Beginning at 14th level, you can utter your words with such perfect cadence that you can convince a group of individuals into doing almost anything. As a move action, reaction, and action that gives advantage on all attack rolls made against you until the start of your next turn, you deliver an oratory masterpiece. You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and superlatively influence a number of creatures equal to your bard level + Charisma modifier. Only creatures that you can see within range and that can hear and understand you can be influenced. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable (you cannot directly ask creatures to harm themselves, as suggestion). Creatures immune to the charmed condition can still be affected by your influence as long as they are able to understand you.

Each target must make a Charisma saving throw against a DC equal to $8+$ your bonus to Charisma (Persuasion) checks. On a failed save, it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability for a number of days equal to $1 / 2$ your proficiency bonus. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, your influence ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.

You can also specify conditions that trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a group of soldiers give all their money to the first beggar they meet. If the condition isn't met before your influence ends, the activity isn't performed.

If you or any of your companions damage a creature affected by your influence, the creature receives a new saving throw to end your influence for that creature.

## WARRIOR OF DARK CHI (Monk)

Most martial arts training requires years of focus and intense study but not all-there are paths that will allow practitioners without scruples to advance far more quickly though few are fearless enough to utilize them. Warriors learn how to harness a kind of negative energy from these dark disciplines, a force that complements those used by more patient combatants (albeit with effects that defy the techniques of their less pragmatic peers).

## Dark Chi

Unlike normal monastic traditions you must choose this tradition at 2nd level when your $k i$ shows signs of impurity and many masters will refuse to teach you. Mysterious entities reach out to you however, offering the knowledge you seek. If you choose to continue in the monk class, your alignment must change to and remain evil or neutral. Should you later become good, any levels in the monk class that you take grant a different monastic tradition (beginning with its 3rd level feature) and you cannot continue this monastic tradition until you return to being evil or neutral. Although you ultimately learn to harness $c h i$, this feature and all other features from this monastic tradition function as if you used $k i$. Unlike normal, chi leaves an aura of evil whenever it is used.

## Dark Chi Technique

Starting at 3rd level, you can tap into dark and evil powers when utilizing your $k i$, transforming it into dark $c b i$. Whenever you hit a creature with one of the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can impose one of the following effects:

- The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it is poisoned by your $c h i$ for a number of rounds equal to your proficiency bonus. The purity of body feature does not protect against this poison.
- The attack deals an additional amount of damage equal to your proficiency bonus and all of its damage changes to necrotic.
- The target can't use $k i$, divine features, or cast divine spells until the end of your next turn.
- The target makes a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, for the next 24 hours the target detects as the alignment of your choice (and if evil, may leave an aura in its wake)..

---

# Scarred Flesh 

Beginning at 6th level, you ritualistically scar your flesh and deaden the nerves against physical pain. By spending a bonus action and 2 chi focusing your energies into the blasphemies emblazoned on your skin, you gain resistance to one type of weapon damage (bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing) for 1 minute.

## Unholy Blasts

At 11th level, you learn how to harness your $c b i$ into physical manifestations of deadly force. By spending $1 c b i$, you can unleash balls of evil energy (range 40/100) instead of unarmed strikes. On a hit, a ball of evil energy deals your unarmed strike damage but changes to force and necrotic. This feature can be used in conjunction with Flurry of Blows but not the Dark Chi Technique feature.

## Evil Manifestation

Starting at 17th level, each time you finish a long rest your $c b i$ manifests itself physically in a different way. Roll 1d6 to determine what benefit you gain from this feature. By spending vilis points, you can change which benefit you gain by one step (for example, if you roll a 4 but want Deadly Claws you may spend two vilis points to gain them instead of Vile Bones.) This benefit remains until the next time you finish a long rest.

1 Blindsight. You grow enormous bat-like ears and are able to perceive your surroundings within 50 feet without relying on sight.
2 Deadly Claws. Your unarmed strike damage changes to slashing and you gain a +3 bonus to attacks and damage when making unarmed strikes.
3 Evil Blood. Your blood becomes acidic. You gain immunity to acid damage and when a creature deals more than 5 piercing or slashing damage to you with a melee weapon attack or natural weapon melee attack, it takes 1 d 8 acid damage.
4 Vile Bones. Your bones become infused by dead spirits that grant you immunity to necrotic damage, critical hits, and damage from the Sneak Attack feature.
5 Wicked Soul. By spending 3 chi as a reaction, you unlock the bottomless pits of the lower planes. For 1 minute your speed is doubled, you gain a +2 bonus to AC, you have advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and you gain an additional action on each of your turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action.
6 Wings. Your rest ends in terrible pain as your back extends and stretches into fearsome wings that give you a flying speed equal to your base walking speed.

## PATRON OF MEAT

The first time you tasted flesh something inside you was emboldened, a primal predatory craving that you held at bay-until you tasted the meat of your own kind. A ray of divinity struck you as clear as day as you chewed the tender remains of one of your own, reveling in the blasphemous flavor and instantly obsessed with acquiring more. There must always be more, you understood. That thing inside yourself blossomed, beckoning out into the void like a vine in the forest until it found its reflection: the Meat.

The Meat must be fed. There must be more, always more. The Meat always desires more. The Meat's hunger is unending. Feed the Meat. Feed the Meat.

---

You form a pact with a mindless primordial entity that knows nothing but hunger, an unyielding and all-consuming desire to consume flesh. Your agreement has made you one of its tasters, allowing it to vicariously experience tender flesh as you work your jaw through blood, muscle, fat, and skin. Every day you must consume the flesh of an intelligent humanoid. Should you consume food during a day but fail to eat the flesh of an intelligent humanoid, you lose the ability to cast spells (but not cantrips) and lose any features granted by your pact until after the next midnight.

Pact of the Blade. Your weapon is either a scimitar that quivers and gasps when it sheds blood or a pitted yet sharp cleaver of enormous size (which uses the statistics of a greataxe).
Pact of the Chain. Your familiar is a depraved, monstrous reflection of your blasphemous soul. At first you can only conjure a fleshy blob of skin and meat that uses the statistics of a Homonculus. When you reach 7 th level in this class, you are able to summon a Gray Ooze as your familiar.
Pact of the Tome. Your Book of Shadows is a living, breathing grimoire covered in flesh, lipless mouths, and gnashing teeth. It gasps when you read it, writhing in your hands and whispering in an endless, senseless jumble of syllables that pique your appetite.

# Expanded Spell List 

The Meat lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

Patron of Meat Expanded Spells

| Warlock <br> Level | Spell Level |
| :--: | :-- |
| 1st | false life, flay skin |
| 2nd | bone spurs, bold person |
| 3rd | slow, vampiric touch |
| 4th | exsanguination, forced hemorrhage |
| 5th | bold monster, sanguine razorstorm |

## Lean and Hungry

When you choose this patron at 1st level, you are always possessed by a desire to eat the flesh of intelligent humanoids (Intelligence 7 or higher). When the opportunity to consume the flesh of a recently killed humanoid presents itself (even an ally's), you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or spend your next action eating part of their body.

You require half as much food and water as normal, and you can go twice as long without food or water before suffering from exhaustion. In addition, your hit point total increases by an amount equal to your warlock level.

## Blood Magician

Starting at 6th level, you master the elegance of sanguine spells and learn to make the most of their primary component. You have resistance against self-inflicted damage from the casting of blood magic (minimum 1 damage).

## Sanguine Magnet

Beginning at 10th level, the affinity your blood has for magic draws it back into your body when your flesh is rent. Whenever you take bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage you take 1 less damage (minimum 1 damage).

## Rilp Out the Broth

At 14th level, you can rip the very blood from your enemies, tearing it directly through their flesh. By spending an action, you make a grapple check against a living creature within 60 feet. You have advantage on this check and use your spell attack bonus instead of Strength (Athletics). On a success, choose either Constitution or Charisma. The target makes a saving throw using the chosen ability score. A target that fails this saving throw gains the paralyzed condition and takes 8d6 force damage (half as much damage on a successful save). Each round the target is paralyzed it takes an additional 4 d 6 force damage at the start of its turn. A paralyzed target makes a new saving throw at the end of each of its turns. Once you have used this feature, you cannot do so again until you have finished a long rest.

# VILE ARCANE TRADITION 

Study of the arcane arts often brings the beck and call of forbidden powers, and you found the offerings from the darkness intriguing. Delving into the darkened corridors of arcana promises discovery upon damning discovery and with every day that passes, you fall deeper into the depths and trappings of unholy magics that stain your very soul.

## Vile Savant

Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy a vile spell into your spellbook is halved.

## Magic for Blood

Also at 2nd level, you learn how to collect ambient evil energy able to replicate the blood needed for vile magic. By spending a bonus action gathering power, you can cast a vile cantrip or spell without inflicting damage to yourself. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.

## Nameless Evil

Starting at 6th level, you can draw in the vile energies left behind by your foulest spells and take their latent power into your soul instead.
Whenever you cast an evil spell, you may choose not to leave an evil aura. Doing so increases your Sin score by 1 if the spell's level is equal to higher than half your wizard level.

---

# Vile Focus 

At 10th level, you learn how to imbue power into a hand-sized object, transforming it into a locus of dark arcana you can use to trick and frustrate your foes. Any item of appropriate size can be turned into a Vile Focus, but when a weapon is used any damage it deals is magical. You may only have a number of vile focuses equal to your proficiency bonus.

By spending a bonus action briefly attuning to a Vile Focus, the next vile spell you cast ties its evil aura to the Vile Focus. Once the aura has faded, the item ceases to be a Vile Focus.

## Master of the Forbidden

When you reach 14th level, your search for evil power becomes less about discovery as the unholy and fell entities in the beyond guide vile knowledge to your dreams, forcing you to inscribe them as you sleep. All vile spells of 7th-level and lower are added to your spellbook. When you learn to cast higher level spells, all vile spells from that higher level are automatically added to your spellbook. These spell inscriptions do not cost you any gold or require any of your time.

## WARRIOR OF DARKNESS (Fighter)

Indulging in evil is seem by some as abhorrent and others as a necessity of dire circumstances, but to you it is as valid a means to power and glory as any other. Seeking out dark tomes, evil spirits, and corrupted relics, you are only as trustworthy as the gold or prize offered for your services-though your unholy abilities give you a reputation that provides ample assurances for the high price required.

## Sinful Slayer

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn the Sinful Slayer feat even if you do not meet its prerequisites.

## Vile Scarring

Beginning at 7th level, you learn how to scarify your body in such a way that ambient malevolent energies
adhere to it like scum in a sewer. You may possess a number of vile scars equal to your proficiency bonus. Marking your body with a vile scar requires 1 hour of effort with a melee weapon that deals piercing or slashing damage and while it is on your body, your hit point total is reduced by 1 . A vile scar can only be removed by a beal or regeneration spell and is otherwise permanent.

- Ascendere Velox. Dark wisps of shadows flit about your form, dragging your steps forward. Climbing and swimming no longer cost you extra movement.
- Aspectus Vacui. The sides of your eyes were
- difficult to scarify but the suffering was worth it for the power instilled in them. You gain darkvision 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, its range increases by 30 feet.

---

- Componere Infernum. Fires from Hell have tempered your skin. You have resistance to fire.
- Iciunium Gradus. Special scars on your body make it easier for you to travel through the physical world, as though pushed by an invisible current. Your speed increases by 15 feet and the first opportunity attack made against you each turn has disadvantage.
- Irrumabo Mortem. Markings of power lock your soul inside of your body, forcing it to cling on to the physical world. You have advantage on death saves.
- Nullum Timorem. You have immunity to the frightened condition.
- Quae Insanimus. Blasphemous energies roil beneath the disfigured skin on your skull. You gain advantage on saving throws to avoid the charmed and stunned conditions.
- Rex Vermes. Lowly creatures speak directly into your corrupted mind. You are able to cast speak with animals at will but it only enables you to speak with insects, rats, and vermin.
- Velatum Ante. Intricate runes of Vilespeech painstakingly carved beneath your skin hide your true soul from view. You gain advantage on saving throws made to avoid revealing your alignment. If a creature would automatically detect your alignment, you receive a Strength saving throw against its spell save DC. If the creature has no spell save DC, use $8+$ proficiency bonus + Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier (whichever is highest).
- Venenum Imbre. Vile magics make you able to spit venom. You are able to innately cast the poison spray cantrip using Strength as your spellcasting ability, requiring no components. In addition, you add a damage bonus equal to your Strength modifier with poison spray.


## Bloodslayer

Starting at 10th level, whenever you kill a creature you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your fighter level. These temporary hit points remain for 1 minute. You can never have more temporary hit points from this feature than your fighter level.

## Ritual Slaughterer

At 15th level, you learn the Ritualistic Slaughterer feat even if you do not meet its prerequisites.

## Unholy Wounding

Also at 15th level, weapon attacks with your ritual weapon score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 if your target has less than half its maximum hit points. Each time you score a critical hit using your ritual weapon, your target takes damage equal to your proficiency bonus at the start of its turn every round until the wound is stanched with a successful Wisdom (Medicine) check (DC $8+$ your proficiency bonus) or the target receives magical healing.

## Bad to the Bone

At 18th level you become a true warrior of darkness, a powerful force to do battle in the name of evil. You gain resistance to radiant damage and you have advantage on saving throws against spells cast by creatures of good alignment.

In addition, the first time you reach 0 hit points after finishing a long rest, you automatically gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your fighter level.

Looking out over Peribolus and smelling the scents of the restaurants below the city wall wafting upward, Sefra smiles to himself and thinks of the stew his wife is cooking up on the stove. He makes a mental note to grab some pastries from the marketplace to surprise her with after picking up his nice boots from the cobbler when suddenly a cry comes from Tybor's post. Sefra rushes across the parapet, the odor of brimstone pushing away the savory scents from below as the screams become louder and louder—

Sefra shudders awake, sitting bolt upright as the cry from someone nearby rests him from the bliss of sleep before becoming a defeated gurgling. With a nauseating lurch he sadly realizes that he is not yet dead, though this is not the dungeon he first awoke in—instead of mold and darkened gray walls, here there is the scent of rose votives and the sheen of saintly tributes.

By Gimli's Holy Beard, this is the basement of a house of worship!

Whether from heresy or the sickness that has taken him this past week, Sefra vomits bile onto himself and winces as it touches on a few spores on his arm, already gashed open from restless sleep to weep pus onto the floor. Shaking with fear he sees that his captor is here as well, doubtless the source of the gag across his mouth and shackles around his limbs; he fights against restraints but days of starvation have made him weak and feeble, left to be bound like a beast for the butcher.

The corpses of fellow prisoners lay about on the brickwork nearby but they lay still, their necks shorn in half to make bubbling brooks of blood that pool in a runed circle carved into the center of the chamber. His gaoler—a tiefling woman clad in spiked gray armor, the edges of its plate serrated and razor-sharp—consults a spectral skull as she adds bits of things to a saucer on a table above him, speaking in a tongue he has never heard before but foul and unpleasant to the ear. Moving back toward the runes she kicks an unconscious halfling closer to the others, orienting his feet away from the design.

She looks at Sefra after picking up the sleeping halfling lad's head to expose his neck, her bloody murder weapon in hand. "Excellent, you are awake." With no remorse she drags the blade across the child's throat, opening it from end to end like the others. "How very good of you. The ritual is much more effective if the final sacrifice is conscious and I am just now ready for your part."

Sefra watches in hatred and horror as she walks over to a table and takes clippings from a recent issue of the Peribolus Observer, dropping bits of the newspaper into the saucer and making it cough up a puff of mauve mist. "Before you die," she says, taking up her jet-black stone knife in one hand, "I would tell you of your contributions today. You see your local Mortuary Regulations Officer, this Dedrio Falcas? He's made it exceptionally difficult for me to continue my... work in this place. Bodies are being cremated before I can get to them, and as of late I have a dire need for bodies." The tiefling looks around at the corpses in the room. "You'll be providing that of course, but so much more." The rug stuffed into his mouth muffles Sefra's reply and she only smiles back at him in turn. "Surely you've noticed you are suffering from an ailment, yes?" She giggles, poking the dead halfling boy's arm with her pointed boot, prompting it to weep pus. "You are all. Or were. And soon Dedrio will be as well, but worse. Far worse."

The mad woman digs the point of her blade into one eye socket, her jaw clenched tightly and bissing in pain. "I will see through his eyes, hear what he hears. I will know where to next send my agents, whom to bribe, where they will be looking for me." Reaching into the wound with her free hand she produces her own eye, dropping it into the saucer before pulling tight a band to cover the blood flowing from the grievous wound on the right side of her face. With the dagger in her other hand she reaches towards Sefra and throws him toward the circle with surprising strength, knocking the wind out of him before placing a knee into his back and leaning in close, whispering, "thanks to you."

# VILE FEATS 

Evil exists in many forms and only the bold dare to venture deep into the waters of wickedness-most are instead tempted to stray down sinful paths until they are consumed by darkness. What follows are 50 feats ideal for villainous adventurers whether the weapon of choice is blade, spell, or deception!

## DEFORMITIES

The evil suffusing your body manifests itself physically, causing strange and inevitable mutations that grant you exceptional dark power.

## Bulging

Prerequisites: Sin 13
Unholy power fills you with great strength but the blasphemous tumors that empower you have contorted your muscles and press upon your skull.

- Your Strength increases by 2.
- You are able to wield two-handed weapons in one-hand and treat one-handed weapons as though they had the light property.
- Your Wisdom decreases by 1.


## Corpulescent

Prerequisites: Sin 13
Exercise and starvation utterly failed to affect your weight gain, the very evil of your soul accruing more and more flesh around your body-much of it is dead and rotting but you've lost all feeling in those nerves.

- Your Constitution increases by 2.
- Whenever you take damage, you take 1 less damage.
- Traveling over long distances is particularly exhausting for you. At the end of a long rest after journeying, if you traveled at a pace faster than Slow for more than 2 hours make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. If you traveled at a Fast pace, you make this saving throw with disadvantage. On a failure, you gain 1 level of exhaustion.


## Enlarged Cerebrum

Prerequisites: Sin 13
Seeking to free your mind from evil spirits using the ancient technique of trepanning, you perforated your skull. Unfortunately that only gave dark entities greater access to your brain, enlarging a part of it.

- As an action, you deduce the resistances and immunities of any creature of a Challenge Rating equal to your level +3 . You must be able to see and hear the target, and the extent of what you can learn is at the discretion of the GM (extremely obscure enemies may reveal very little). Once you have used this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence bonus, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.
- You have advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) checks.
- Your Intelligence increases by 2.
- Your Dexterity decreases by 2.


## Gaunt

Prerequisites: Sin 13
Evil sucks at your muscles, drawing them down to the bone and giving you a ghastly appearance. Your condition has reduced the flow of blood to most of your brain, pumping more of it through your heart instead.

- You have advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks.
- Your speed increases by 10 feet.
- Your Dexterity increases by 2.
- Your Intelligence decreases by 2.


## Malformed Basal Ganglia

Prerequisites: Sin 13
An unholy tumor has formed in the intuitive part of your brain and expanded your mind, drawing you to the attention of dark things from the beyond that touched you with a supernatural gift.

- You are able to telepathically communicate with creatures you are able to see. Even if you do not share a language with the creature, you are able to send mental images (and receive them back if the creature so chooses).
- Your Wisdom increases by 2.
- You have vulnerability to psychic damage.
- When you would be charmed or otherwise compelled, roll 1d20. On a result equal to or less than your character level you ignore the effect.

# GRAFTING 

Gritting her teeth in pain as her muscles strain against the force of an ogre's club, the fighter parries with her shortsword but only barely in time to save her life. She lunges forward with a feinting longsword strike in response, catching her foe off guard and forcing him into the a wicked green gas that she belches forth from a rotted tongue-her monstrous enemy breathes deep and begins to slow, ripe for the kill.

After hours of careful hiding, bushed footsteps, hasty retreats, and arduous climbing, the rogue has finally reached the empress' quarters, cloaked in darkness and clinging to the exterior of her tower. Waiting for what seems to be an eternity but could only barely be more than an hour, he finally risks being sighted and lowers himself down just enough to spy through the window, making certain that only his target lay sleeping within. Beckoning the evil from within himself to awaken, the rogue leans down and waves an arm covered in putrid feathers, letting forth deadly spores that waft into the interior of the empress' bedchamber, poisoning her in her sleep and fulfilling a weighty contract.

Whooping in a primal roar that shakes the bones of her enemies as she leaps forward, the barbarian twists and contorts as two massive crimson wings sprout from her body to carry her aloft, her visage becoming ever more terrifying until nearly all who see her flee in panic. Those that remain raise their shields as she glides to mete out death with a wicked red arm that sputtering with the flames of Hell itself.

Whether through blasphemous unholy rituals, arcane experimentation, or as the subject of mad science, some characters come to incorporate biological components that are not their own. Regardless of if they were willing to undergo the change or became a victim while captured by insane dark creatures, these fundamental alterations to one's physical form are not easily undertaken and completely irreversible without the aid of epic magics. Those who survive the process are forever changed and marked as different from their peers, the foreign parts of their body undeniably bizarre and impossible to hide-but blessed with potent fell powers.

## Experimenting and Grafting

Simply acquiring an experiment feat immediately grants its benefits-unless the GM decrees otherwise, the actual acquisition of any following feats are narratively-driven and do not require actually finding a creature and the ingratiation of a foreign body part.

Should the GM decide it, a character must have the part of another creature's body that they want to make their own in order to graft it. Though this can be challenging for rare targets, a character with an experiment feat is able to express their own will on a conjured creature in order to gain the desired limb. When the summoned creature dies, the character makes a Constitution saving throw opposed by a Constitution ability check by the summoner; on a success, the rest of the conjured creature disappears but the desired body part remains for $1 \mathrm{~d} 4+5$ minutes.

So long as a body part comes from a creature permanently on the Material Plane (or as described above) and is fresh (or properly preserved with a bag of holding, gentle repose spell, or other appropriate measures), a grafting character can morph it onto themselves. Grafting the foreign body

---

part on requires the corresponding part from the grafting creature's body be removed (dealing 1d10 points of damage to themselves) and a Wisdom (Medicine) check (DC equal to the grafting creature's Hit Dice) in a gruesome process that takes 5 minutes to perform. Other characters may assist with the Wisdom (Medicine) check as normal, but attempts to perform it themselves increase the DC to $3+$ grafting creature's Hit Dice.

# Celestial Grafts 6 Wicked Grafts 

Though not as easily acquired as some other grafts there are few more evil acts than to dismember a celestial, stitching and morphing it into one's own body. Performing so blasphemous an act as to steal the gifts of the divine forever marks an entity as arrayed against the powers of good but that's all the better-it makes acquiring more specimens for capture, dissection, and inclusion all the easier. Integration of a fiendish body part is a much different process that far more frequently has the blessings of the vile creature donating an organ or limb.

## Couatl Crest

Prerequisite: Proficiency Bonus +3
You grow a resplendent feathery crest on your forehead not unlike that of a glorious celestial serpent, making your mind an impregnable fortress and expanding your consciousness.

- You gain immunity to scrying and to any effect that would sense your emotions, read your thoughts, or detect your location.
- You gain telepathy to a range of 60 feet. If you already possess telepathy, its range increases by 30 feet.


## Deva Wings

Prerequisite: Proficiency Bonus +3
Large, magnificent wings made from feathers of gold sprout out of your shoulder blades, allowing you to both soar through the skies and call on celestial energies to smite your foes.

- You gain large golden wings that grant you a fly speed of 90 feet. You may deploy or retract these wings as a free action.
- Once per long rest you may spend a bonus action to bathe your weapons in angelic energy. This energy persists for a number of rounds equal to your proficiency bonus, dealing 9 (2d8) radiant damage with each successful attack you make.


## Holy Gear

You have stolen a celestial cog and now the great machinations of benign entities influencing existence resonate within your being, driving you onward with unfailing resolve. Any attempts made to compel you to act in a manner directly opposed to your nature or the orders of a quest you are undertaking automatically fail. Whether or not a compulsion or effect qualifies for this feat is entirely at the discretion of the GM and sufficiently clever commands may still be effective.

## Pegasus Wings

Prerequisite: Proficiency Bonus +3
Two pairs of sizable wings emerge from your back, like those of a flighted celestial horse. Though they constrain your movements, you are able to traverse through the air with implacable grace.

- You gain large feathery wings that grant you a fly speed of 60 feet.
- You are disadvantage when making Charisma ability checks against evil creatures.
- You cannot wear heavy armor.


## Planetar Visage

Prerequisite: Proficiency Bonus +4
You are able to call upon the divine to cover yourself in the celestial hide of one of the greatest sects of angels, giving you truly extraordinary defenses against either falsehoods or magical harm.

- Your skin turns golden and you gain advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- As a bonus action, you may lose the other benefit of this feat but gain the ability to automatically detect lies. Ending the effects of this feat and renewing its other benefit requires a bonus action.


## Solar Gaze

Prerequisite: Proficiency Bonus +4
Your stare embodies all of the authority of the great beyond, able to rob sight from those you find unworthy and granting you a level of protection from divine energy.

- You gain immunity to the blinded condition.
- You gain resistance to radiant damage.
- As a bonus action, you may target one creature you can see within 30 feet. If the target can see you, the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC $8+$ your Charisma ability modifier + your proficiency bonus) or be blinded.

---

# Unicorn Horn 

A horn sprouts from your forehead that attunes you to the energies of the Upper Planes, making you able to protect or heal living creatures. After taking this feat, whenever you finish a long rest you gain a number of charges equal to your proficiency bonus. You may have a maximum number of charges equal to half your level +1 . You may spend a bonus action and 1 charge to create one of the following effects.

Celestial Restoration: You or a living creature you touch regain a number of hit points equal to $2 \mathrm{~d} 8+$ your proficiency bonus. By expending an action and 2 charges you may increase the regained hit points by 1 d 8 . Celestial Shield: You create a shimmering, magical field around yourself or another living creature you can see within 60 feet. The target gains a +2 bonus to AC until the end of your next turn. By expending an action and 2 charges you may increase the bonus to AC to +4 .

## Abyssal Experiment

Prerequisite: Constitution 13 or higher, evil or neutral alignment
You inherited a curious trait from an ancestor that dabbled in evil or your soul became tainted by exposure to a dark artifact. Now your body is able to incorporate parts from the maddened creatures that hail from the chaotic realms of the Abyss: demons.

You may use your reaction to gain advantage on an ability check. You may use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus before requiring a long rest to recharge it. You may also recharge this feature by taking a short rest after committing a chaotic and heinous act.

## Balor Wings

Prerequisite: Abyssal Experiment, Proficiency Bonus +4
You have acquired the terrifying wings of a great demon, able to take to the sky and call upon some of their original bearer's dark power to burn your foes with the flames of the Abyss. You gain the following benefits:

- You may spend an action to sprout wings that grant you a fly speed of 80 feet. While these wings are out, you are at disadvantage when making non-Intimidation Charisma ability checks against creatures that are not evil.
- By spending a bonus action you may retract your wings to a quarter of their size, losing your fly speed but gaining a fire aura. At the start of your turn, each creature within 5 feet of you takes 3 d 6 fire damage, and flammable objects in the aura that aren't being carried or worn ignite. A creature that touches you or hits you with a melee attack while within 5 feet of you takes 3d6 fire damage. You may only use this fire aura for a number of rounds equal to your proficiency bonus before requiring a short rest. These rounds need not be consecutive and you can return the wings to full size as a bonus action.

---

# Devil's Arm 

Prerequisite: Infernal Experiment, Proficiency Bonus +4
The ruby red arm of a devil juts out of your shoulder or the hide of an infernal servant covers your own arm, granting you a conduit that draws power from Hell itself. You gain the following benefits:

- Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 2 . Your maximum for those scores increases by 2 .
- You are able to conjure flames to use as ranged attacks. By spending a bonus action, you generate as many flames as you have attacks in a round; at the beginning of your next turn, any unused flames dissipate. The range for your hurled flames is 150 feet and on a successful hit, they deal 4 d 6 fire damage + your Strength modifier. If the target is a flammable object that isn't being worn or carried, it also catches fire.
- You are at disadvantage when making nonIntimidation Charisma ability checks against creatures able to see you.


## Dretch Belch

Prerequisite: Abyssal Experiment
Within your mouth is the wretched tongue of a dretch, a fetid and disgusting thing that both fortifies you against poison and gives you a means of toxicating others. You gain the following benefits:

- You gain immunity to the poisoned condition and resistance to poison damage.
- You are at disadvantage when making nonIntimidation Charisma ability checks against creatures that are not evil and able to smell you.
- By spending an action, you expel a 10 -foot radius of disgusting green gas that spreads around corners and makes the squares it occupies lightly obscured. It lasts for 1 minute or until a strong wind disperses it. Any creature that starts its turn in that area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC $8+$ your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier) or be poisoned until the start of its next turn. While poisoned in this way, the target can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both, and can't take reactions. You require a long rest before you are able to belch gas again.


## Imp's Eye

Prerequisite: Infernal Experiment
One of your eyes has been replaced with an eye from one of Hell's lowliest denizens and ugly as it is, you pierce darkness as easily as a dagger bites flesh. You gain the following benefits:

- You gain darkvision 60 feet. If you already have darkvision it increases by 60 feet.
- Magical darkness does not impede your vision.
- You are at disadvantage when making nonIntimidation Charisma ability checks against creatures that are not evil and able to see you.


## Infernal Experiment

Prerequisite: Constitution 13 or higher, evil or neutral alignment
Diabolical rituals performed while you grew in the womb (or those enacted on one of your family line in ages past) run strong in your blood, making your body perfectly suited to adopt limbs and organs parts ripped from the blasphemous entities of Hell: devils. You may spend your reaction to gain advantage on a saving throw. You may use this feature a number of times equal to half your proficiency bonus before requiring a long rest to recharge it. You may also recharge this feature by taking a short rest after committing a duplicitous or evil act.

## Infernal Mask

Prerequisite: Infernal Experiment, Proficiency Bonus +3
Your visage can contort and transform into a rictus that resembles the devil from whence it came, filling your enemies with terror. When a creature you can see starts its turn within 30 feet of you, you can spend a bonus action to create an illusion that uses the creature's deepest fears to utterly horrify it. If the creature can see you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC $8+$ your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or be frightened until the end of its turn. By spending an action instead, you may affect a number of creatures equal to your proficiency bonus.

## Vrock Feathers

Prerequisite: Abyssal Experiment, Proficiency Bonus +3 You are able to sprout the feathers of a dreaded vrock. Though this evil plumage does not grant you any aerial ability, they are as deadly and toxic as the demon from whence they came. You gain the following benefits:

- You may spend an action to sprout vrock feathers that grant you immunity to the poisoned condition and resistance to poison damage (if you have resistance to

---

poison damage, you gain immunity to poison damage). While these feathers are out, you are at disadvantage when making non-Intimidation Charisma ability checks against creatures that are not evil. Retracting vrock feathers requires a bonus action.

- By spending an action while your vrock feathers are out, you emit a cloud of toxic spores in a 15 -foot-radius. The spores spread around corners. Each creature in that area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC $8+$ your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier) or become poisoned. While poisoned in this way, a target takes 5 (1d10) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Emptying a vial of holy water on the target also ends the effect on it. You require a short rest before you are able to release another cloud of toxic spores.


# RITUAL FEATS 

Usually fell rites are the purvey of cult masters, demon-worshiping nobles, and mad priests, but not always. All rituals have a sacrificial cost of some kind, usually with a mechanical impact. At the GM's discretion, additional components and steps may allow the master of a ritual to grant its benefits to another creature within sight rather than itself. All of the rituals below leave an evil aura that lingers for a number of hours equal to the character level or challenge rating of the creature performing them, and if performed as a vile ritual the ritual's aura lingers for twice as long.

## Ancestral Sacrifice

Prerequisites: Arcana or Religion, Ceremonial Relics Using dark rites and primordial chants, you draw out the life force of a creature similar enough to you that the energies of their soul can be gathered up as it leaves the Material Plane and warped to reinforce your own.

You are able to make ancestral sacrifices. Making an ancestral sacrifice requires a creature that is both older than you and of the same race (and if
applicable, subrace). After spending 10 minutes preparing the ritual space, you may kill the elder creature to gain one of the following benefits. You are only able to benefit from one ancestral sacrifice at a time.

- You recharge all class features, race features, and spell slots as if you had taken a long rest.
- You gain a number of temporary hit

---

points equal to half the elder creature's maximum total hit points or half your maximum total hit points (whichever is greater). These temporary hit points last for a number of hours equal to your proficiency bonus.

- You gain the use of a feat that the elder creature knew, or you gain proficiency in the skills the elder creature had proficiency in. After a number of hours equal to your proficiency bonus, the knowledge fades.
- You gain proficiency in a type of saving throw the elder creature had proficiency in. After a number of days equal to your proficiency bonus, this resilience fades.

Vile Ritual. By sacrificing an elder directly related to you (blood relatives), you permanently gain proficiency in one skill the elder creature had proficiency in and your Sin increases by 1 .

## Blood of Infants

Prerequisites: Evil alignment, Proficiency Bonus +3, Sin 9 By accepting true depravity and engorging yourself on the blood and flesh of innocent youth, you develop forbidden abilities and despicable powers that can avert the living from you when reveling in your disgusting primal cannibalistic desires.

By performing a 1 hour ritual that requires the innocent blood of 1 adolescent creature (of any creature type) per point of proficiency bonus you possess, you can reduce the effects of aging on your person (making you appear and feel 1 month younger) and grant yourself one of the following effects for a number of days equal to your level:

- Proficiency with Sanctity ability checks.
- Proficiency with Sin ability checks.
- Proficiency with Sanctity saving throws.
- Proficiency with Sin saving throws.
- Your weapon attacks count as magical.
- You are able to fashion a cloak, coat, cowl, hood, pelt, shroud, or other substantially-sized piece of clothing out of the corpses of at least 10 adolescent creatures (of any creature type) after 1 day of work. By performing a ritual that costs 40 gp in other materials, you can enchant your fleshcloth to mewl and moan when you take a critical hit, forcing your
attacker to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC $8+$ your proficiency bonus + your Sin modifier) or become frightened of you for 1 d 4 rounds. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once a creature has resisted becoming frightened by your fleshcloth, the creature is immune to it for the next 24 hours.

Vile Ritual. By using the blood and flesh of adolescent intelligent humanoids (dwarves, elves, humans, etc.), the duration of a blood ritual's benefits becomes 1 year. You may cause your fleshcloth to mewl as a bonus action and any creature that comes within 30 feet of it must make a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 d 4 rounds. Using adolescent intelligent humanoids increases your Sin by 1 for a blood ritual or by 2 for a fleshcloth.

## Master of Rituals

Prerequisites: Arcana or Religion, Ceremonial Relics, Proficiency Bonus +3, ability to cast ritual spells You have delved deeply into the secrets of ritual magic and are able to beseech powers from beyond the veil to gain supernatural gifts, though never without cost.

By performing an hour long ritual that costs 50 gold in materials, you are able to grant yourself or one willing creature one of the following ritual powers. A creature may have a number of ritual powers equal to $1 / 3$ its proficiency bonus.

If a ritual power lets you cast a spell, you are able to do so without spending a spell slot or providing any components (verbal, somatic, or material). In any case, a ritual power can't be used in the area created by an antimagic field or a similar effect, and a ritual power's effects are susceptible to counterspell and dispel magic (the ritual power itself can't be removed from a creature by anything short of divine intervention or the wish spell.)

- POWER OF BLOODLETTING. Boil an amount of the target'sblood (bit points) equal to double the target's Hit Dice. When the target deals damage with a melee weapon attack, they may choose to deal $1 \mathrm{~d} 4,1 \mathrm{~d} 6,1 \mathrm{~d} 8$, or 1 d 10 additional damage but they also take the same amount of damage. After

---

a number of hours equal to the target's Hit Dice, the ritual power vanishes. The target's Sin increases by 1 .

Vile Ritual. By including some of the target's bone and flesh (an ear, toe, fingertip) in the boil, the ritual power remains for 1 day and the target's Sin does not increase.

- POWER OF MANA. Sacrifice a fey. This ritual power has 6 charges. The target can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast the following spells: detect magic ( 1 charge), identify ( 1 charge), or dispel magic ( 3 charges). Once all its charges have been expended, the ritual power vanishes. The target's Sin increases by 1.

Vile Ritual. Sacrificing a fey that has had its willpower broken by torture (page 11) doubles the ritual power's number of charges.

- POWER OF NEGATION. Sacrifice an aberration. This ritual power has 4 charges. The target can use their reaction to expend a charge and gain advantage on a saving throw against a spell or other magical effect. Once all its charges have been expended, the ritual power vanishes.

Vile Ritual. Sacrificing an aberration that has had its willpower broken by torture (page 11) doubles the ritual power's number of charges. The target's Sin increases by 1.

- POWER OF SUMMONING. Sacrifice an innocent humanoid. You summon a fiend or undead of a CR equal to or less than $1 / 2$ the CR of the sacrificed creature (as the animate dead spell). This operates as the conjure elemental spell. After using this ritual power it vanishes. Your Sin increases by 1 (or if the summoned creature's CR is greater than 10 , your Sin increases by 2 ).

Vile Ritual. Using a sacrifice that permanently ends a familial bloodline of an intelligent humanoid (with no blood relatives capable of producing offspring) allows you to summon a fiend or undead of a CR equal to or less than the CR of the sacrificed creature.

- POWER OF THE BEAST. Sacrifice a beast. The target gains the benefits of an enhance ability spell to one ability score of your choice so long as the sacrificed creature has a higher value in that ability score than the target does. After a number of hours equal to the sacrificed creature's Hit Dice, the ritual power vanishes.

Vile Ritual. By making a Constitution saving throw (DC $11+$ the beast's CR) to
consume the still-beating heart of the sacrificed creature, the target can either choose two ability scores or extend the duration of the ritual power doubles.

## Plague Ritual

Prerequisites: Proficiency Bonus +4, ability to cast spells, evil alignment
Sickening one man might trouble him and his family for a day, but sicken an entire family and you sicken a community-to sicken a community however is to sicken a whole settlement, and then two or four or ten until whole countries suffer from plague. You are a master of such misery, a worker of foul diseases that can lay low armies, cities, and even nations. You gain the following benefits:

- You learn the contagion spell.
- You have immunity to disease, poison damage, and the poisoned condition.
- In addition to these benefits, you are able to perform rituals that spread diseases far more efficiently than through the casting of one spell.
- Take one creature suffering from a disease (which may be bestowed through contagion) and starve it with increasingly smaller portions each day that dwindle to nothing after 5 days. Once the creature has been fully starved for 2 more days (suffering from two levels of exhaustion) you must slowly bleed it to death. After boiling the collected blood of the creature for an hour, you may take an accurate effigy of a target (a photograph, portrait painting, or 1 ounce of the target's blood, hair, or skin), drop it into the mixture, expend a 5th-level spell slot, and spend 1 vilis point to cast contagion on the target from as far as 3 miles away. The target has disadvantage on its saving throw. You may target additional creatures with this casting of contagion by spending more vilis points ( 1 per target).

Vile Ritual. By removing your own eye, boiling it in the mixture, then pushing it back into the socket, you can willingly subject yourself to the same disease you cast on the target (ignoring your immunity) to be able to perceive through the target's senses. As an action, you can see through the target's eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the target has. During this time, you have disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.

# Ritualistic Slaughterer 

Prerequisites: Arcana or Religion, Proficiency Bonus +3, evil alignment
You have a capacity for killing en masse, slaughtering fellow humanoids with the same disposition as a farmer culling livestock-or possibly even reveling in the bloodshed.

Choose a weapon to become your ritual slaughter weapon. While wielding your ritual slaughter weapon, you gain a magical bonus to critical hit damage equal to your proficiency bonus.

When you kill a creature of a challenge rating equal to at least $1 / 2$ your Hit Dice, your ritual slaughter weapon triggers a bloodlust. While in a bloodlust, you gain a +1 bonus to either weapon attacks or weapon damage rolls made with your ritual slaughter weapon. A bloodlust lasts for a number of rounds equal to your proficiency bonus and its duration can be increased by killing another creature that would trigger it. This bonus stacks with itself and the other bonuses from Ritualistic Slaughterer, but the durations for bloodlusts overlap. For example, triggering a bloodlust that lasts for 4 rounds and then triggering a second bloodlust 2 rounds later, the bloodlust becomes +2 for 2 rounds before becoming +1 for 2 rounds.

When you kill a creature of a challenge rating equal to or greater than your Hit Dice, you trigger a bloodlust that lasts for a number of minutes equal to your proficiency bonus.

Vile Ritual. Taking the ritual slaughter weapon of another creature and making it your own increases your Sin by 1 . When you deal bonus damage with it on a critical hit, you regain a number of hit points equal to the bonus damage from the Ritualistic Slaughter feat (including bloodlust).

## Voodoo

Prerequisites: Arcana, Religion, Proficiency Bonus +3 You learn how to beseech and entreat loa, lesser spirits of life. By presenting offerings, creating personal altars or objects of devotion, and participating in rituals (ranging from dancing and music to allowing loa to briefly possess your body), you convince them to use their otherworldly powers in service to you.

After a long rest choose either Investigation or Perception. The passive score for the skill you choose increases by 5 until the next time you finish a long rest.
After collecting at least 1 ounce of hair, skin, blood, or other part of another
creature's body you are able to fashion it into a small simulacra that loa tie to the creature's life force. So long as the creature you make the simulacra from is within 100 feet and you are able to see it, you may cast cantrips or use class features with a range of touch (like a diabolist's Necromantic Touch) against the creature by targeting its simulacra. After damaging a creature through the simulacra a number of times equal to its Hit Dice, the simulacra is destroyed if you do not make a Wisdom saving throw (DC $10+$ Hit Dice of target creature). When the simulacra is destroyed your Sin increases by 1.

Vile Ritual. By infusing some of your soul in a dark trade with the afterlife during the creation of a voodoo simulacra, you are able to use weapon attacks to damage the creature tied to it. Your Sin increases by 1 as soon as the simulacra is complete.

## SINFUL FEATS

For the truly black of heart evil can offer potent secrets to grant unrivaled power, but not without consequence. Whenever a creature learns a sinful feat, its Sin increases by 1 and its Sanctity decreases by 2.

## Abyssal Attunement

Prerequisite: Wisdom 13 or higher, chaotic evil or neutral evil alignment
Your blood is touched by the taint of the Abyss. You may have been corrupted in a past life, given new life as a twisted soul, or been born the spawn of a demon. You gain the following benefits.

- You may spend a reaction to gain advantage on an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw. You may use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus before requiring a long rest to recharge it. You may also recharge this feature by taking a short rest after committing an evil act as a show of mental dominance over another.
- The first time after taking a long rest that you would be poisoned, you do not gain the poisoned condition and instead cannot gain advantage for 1 round.


## Asura Attunement

Prerequisite: Dexterity 13 or higher, evil alignment The malevolent energies of the asura radiate in your blood. You may have been fooled into accepting the power by a rakshasa or one of the duplicitous creatures may have secretly joined your family line in

---

the past. When a creature you can see attacks you, you may use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You may use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus before requiring a long rest to recharge it. You may also recharge this feature by taking a short rest after committing an evil act unnoticed by any other creatures (any act that increases your Sin score qualifies but sufficiently vile activity may suffice at the GM's discretion).

## Draconic Attunement

Prerequisite: Strength 13 or higher, evil alignment
Draconic blood flows through your veins. You may have inherited your lineage directly from a dragon or an ancestor may have had direct contact with one of the great winged serpents. However it came to be, your body is attuned to the powerful might of wicked dragons. Choose one type of chromatic dragon (black, blue, green, red, white) or vile dragon. You gain the following benefits:

- You may spend a reaction to gain advantage on an attack roll. You may use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus before requiring a long rest to recharge it. You may also recharge this feature by taking a short rest after committing an evil act as a show of physical might.
- The first time after taking a long rest that you would take damage of the type associated with your chosen dragon (black-acid, blue-lightning, green-poison, red-fire, vile-necrotic, whitecold), you reduce that damage by 10 points.


## Evil Borne

Prerequisite: Sin 15 or higher
The urge for evil is embedded into your very soul, the vilest of behaviors utterly natural. After finishing a long rest, you regain a number of vilis points equal to your Sin modifier.

## Infernal Attunement

Prerequisite: Charisma 13 or higher, lawful evil or neutral evil alignment
The fires of Hell burn in your blood. You may have inherited your lineage from prior interaction with a devil in your family history or by entering a contract with a fiend yourself. You gain the following benefits:

- You may spend a reaction to draw fire from your blood to flow onto your strikes, dealing an additional 1 d 4 points of fire damage on your next successful melee attack within 1 minute. You may use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus before requiring a long rest to recharge it. You may also recharge this feature by taking a short rest after committing an evil act in which you outwit or verbally outmaneuver a foe.
- The first time in a day that you would fail a saving throw against an enchantment spell, you can attempt the saving throw again and take the new result.

# Master of Undeath 

Prerequisites: Ability to cast animate dead or otherwise conjure undead
The energies that animate undead are as natural to you as the air you breathe, making your connection with the unliving truly uncanny. You gain the following benefits:

- As an action, you can see and hear what an undead you have summoned sees and hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the undead has. During this time you are not deaf and blind with regard to your own senses, giving you disadvantage on any Wisdom (Perception) checks you make from either vantage.
- Your skin takes a pale tone as your bones start to consume your own blood. Your AC increases by an amount equal to half your proficiency bonus. Your maximum hit point total is permanently reduced by 6 .
- You no longer need to breathe and are immune to gasses that need to be breathed to effect a creature.
- You still require long rests but no longer need to sleep.
- You need to eat and drink half as much as a normal creature and even then, only half as often.
- You learn speak with dead and can cast it at will.


## Practiced Fleshworker

Prerequisites: Able to perform chirurgical procedures
Mastering fleshcraft is no small matter but you have honed your skills with the scalpel on countless subjects (willing or otherwise) and have become a truly deft chirurgeon. When you perform a chirurgical procedure you do so in half the time, you gain a +2 bonus on checks made to perform chirurgical procedures, your chirurgical procedures only end in malpractice when you roll two natural 1 s , and patients cannot die from your failed chirurgical procedures unless they roll a natural 1 on their Constitution saving throw.

## Primordial Speaker

Prerequisites: Vilespeech, evil alignment
You learn some of the primordial words of Cogerangario in the nuances of Vilespeech, blasphemous pronunciations said to be the first utterances of any entities in existence. These simple words themselves contain incredible power and despicable energies, making it dangerous to sound them aloud-even at a
![img-27.jpeg](assets/Book%20of%20true%20Evil_img-27.jpeg)
whisper they might crack the speaker's teeth or rupture blood vessels in a listener's ear.

You know a number of primordial words equal to half your proficiency bonus, selected from the following list. After uttering a primordial word, any more uses of that primordial word in the next 24 hours double their negative effects. Once you have learned one type of primordial word,

---

you may not select from that type again until you have learned at least one primordial word from all other types.

Noun: ADMORDEO. As a reaction after you hit a living creature with a weapon attack that deals piercing or slashing damage, you hiss a word of bloodlust, dealing 6 points of damage to yourself. Your attack deals an additional amount of damage equal to your proficiency bonus.

Noun: EXPLIVAS. As a bonus action you spit out a word of primal malice that manifests into a wave of force, dealing 4 points of damage to yourself. Make a ranged attack roll against a creature within 30 feet. On a hit you deal 1d12 thunder damage plus your Strength modifier. On a critical hit, the creature is knocked prone.

Noun: JUNCTIO. As an action you speak a curiously long word of oppression, dealing 8 points of damage to yourself. The primordial word reaches out to a creature within 30 feet, wrapping it in bands of crushing force. Make a Constitution (Athletics) check opposed by the target's Strength (Athletics) check. On a success the creature is grappled until the end of your next turn.

Adjective: ANTEACTUS. As an action, you utter a jibbering of syllables that pluck along the chords of fate, dealing 12 points of damage to yourself and bringing the energies of moments in the past to your senses. As long as you remain motionless, the events of the past reveal themselves to you:

- After 1 minute you can sense the strongest emotion associated with an area or object you are touching.
- After 2 minutes you can glean the general features of the creature the emotion belongs to.
- After 3 minutes you have a clear mental image of the creature the emotion belongs to.
- After 4 minutes you learn the person's basic details (in what city they live, what their job is, and so on).
- After 5 minutes you learn the person's name.

Remaining motionless requires a Constitution saving throw to retain concentration every 30 seconds (DC $5+1$ per previous check). If a creature is in combat within 30 feet, you have disadvantage on the Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration.

Adjective: PRAESENS. As a bonus action, you whisper a questioning word from the void, dealing 10 points of damage to yourself, but in return you are gifted with glimpses of possible futures and likely outcomes. You have advantage on your next d20 roll.

Adjective: RELICUS. As an action, you speak inquisitive words that bellow the energies of ages past to echo against events yet to come, dealing 15 points of damage to yourself but granting you the ability to see into the distant future. For the next 24 hours you cannot be surprised and your companions gain advantage on checks made to avoid being surprised.

Verb: ECFIO. As an action, you speak confounding words that disrupt a creature's mind, dealing 12 points of damage to yourself. Choose a creature within 30 feet and make a Charisma saving throw opposed by the target's Charisma saving throw. On a success, you charm the target for 1 round and compel it to perform a 2 word command that does not immediately endanger it (for instance, you could compel a creature to "attack that" or "drop sword" but not "kill yourself" or "drown").

Verb: EXCAECO. As an action and bonus action, you pulverize your mouth to shout a potent word of seizing command, dealing 20 points of damage to yourself. Choose a creature within 60 feet and make a Strength saving throw opposed by the target's Charisma saving throw. On a success, you paralyze the creature until the beginning of your next turn.

Verb: IGNARUS. As an action, you bellow a dreaded word that terrifies a creature, dealing 10 points of damage to yourself. Choose a creature within 45 feet and make a Charisma saving throw opposed by the target's Wisdom saving throw. On a success, you make the creature frightened of you until the end of your next turn. By spending a bonus action and dealing 5 points of damage to yourself to continue bellowing, you may extend the duration of the creature's fear by 1 round.

Verb: NILUM. As an action, you utter a baffling word that muddles the senses, dealing 8 points of damage to yourself. Choose a creature within 30 feet and make a Wisdom saving throw opposed by the target's Wisdom saving throw. On a success, you make the creature blind and deaf until the end of your next turn. By spending a bonus action and dealing 4 points of damage to yourself to continue uttering, you may extend the duration of the creature's blindness and deafness by 1 round.

## Promethean Attunement

Preroyaisite: Constitution 13 or higher, evil alignment You are not entirely natural. You may have missing body parts replaced with constructed parts or perhaps you were brought back to life via an amalgamation

---

of flesh, organs, and magic. You gain the following benefits:

- You may use your reaction to gain advantage on a Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution ability check. You may use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus before requiring a long rest to recharge it. You may also recharge this feature by taking a short rest after committing an evil act which damages you in some way.
- The first time in a day that you would be reduced below 0 hit points, you instead remain at 1 hit point.


## Sinful Magic

Prerequisites: Ability to cast spells of 2nd-level or higher, Int 16 or Wis 16 or Cha 16, evil alignment
You have accessed forbidden secrets and unholy knowledge, unlocking primal and ancient power that bestows evil into the very magic that you conjure. You gain the following benefits:

- Each day when you prepare spells, choose a number of spells equal to your spellcasting attribute modifier. You gain a +1 bonus to spell attacks and spell save DCs with these spells and they leave an evil aura in their wake.
- While casting a spell, you may expend 1 vilis point per spell level (minimum 1). You gain advantage on the spell attack roll or cause a creature targeted by the spell to make its saving throw to resist it with disadvantage.


## Sinful Slayer

Prerequisites: Proficiency bonus +3, Str 16 or Dex 16, evil alignment
There are certain expectations between combatants that most warriors adhere to but you are not among them. You do whatever is required to gain the upper hand in a fight, taking cruel pleasure when an opponent's defenses open up and you can strike a mortal blow. You gain the following benefits:

- You learn how to inscribe blasphemous markings onto your armor, covering it in symbols that defy the senses. It takes you 1 hour with a weapon that deals piercing or slashing damage to mark your armor, after which the symbols fade. After you take damage or deal weapon damage the
![img-28.jpeg](assets/Book%20of%20true%20Evil_img-28.jpeg)
markings sense blood and swim to the surface, increasing your AC by 1 until 1 minute after combat ends.
- When you score a critical hit, you may expend 1 vilis point to infuse the blow with evil energies. The target of your attack makes a Charisma saving throw against the damage of the attack or gains a level of exhaustion.
- When you have advantage on a melee attack roll, you may expend 1 vilis point to gain a +5 bonus to damage instead of having advantage.


## Sinful Spellcasting

Prerequisites: Sinful Magic
The dark secrets you first gleaned have led to a complete abandonment of morality as you pursue ever greater forbidden powers, channeling primal evil into your spells. You gain the following benefits:

- You gain advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) and Intelligence (Religion) checks regarding evil.
- When you successfully hit with a spell attack, you can spend vilis points to deal extra damage. You deal 1 d 8 necrotic damage for every vilis point spent this way (maximum 3d8) and can spend a maximum number of vilis points equal to spell level. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. Any spell cast using this feature leaves an evil aura.


## Sinful Strikes

Prerequisites: Sinful Slayer
Opening up your essence to ancient and evil entities has forever cursed your soul, turning it as black as the void. The foul pact is not without its rewards however and your dark gifts allow your strikes to bestow wounds that bleed with evil. You gain the following benefits:

- You gain advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks and Wisdom (Perception) checks.
- When you successfully hit a living creature, you may spend 1 vilis point to delivering an unholy wound. The target of your attack must succeed on a Charisma saving (DC $8+$ your proficiency bonus + your Sin modifier) takes 2 (1d4) necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns as the unholy wound bleeds. Each time you deliver an additional unholy wound to a target, the damage dealt by the unholy wound increases by 2 (1d4). The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest.

---

Any creature can stanch the wound as an action with a successful Wisdom (Medicine) check against the same DC or by receiving magical healing. Damage dealt by an unholy wound leaves an evil aura.

# Undead Attunement 

Prerequisite: Intelligence 13 or higher, evil alignment, ability to cast spells
The potent necrotic energy of cunning mortality-defying mages flows in your veins. Your lineage has a history of undeath or you may have returned from beyond the pale yourself. You gain the following benefits:

- When you take necrotic damage, you may spend your reaction to regain hit points equal to 1 d 4 + your Intelligence modifier. You may use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus before requiring a long rest to recharge it. You may also recharge this feature by taking a short rest after using committing an evil act that causes a creature to suffer a long, painful death.
- The first time that you would fail a spell attack roll after finishing a long rest, you can reroll the spell attack roll and use the new result.


## CHIRURGICAL PROCEDURES

You learn chirurgical procedures from discovered or purchased tomes containing the instructions for the operation or are taught by another fleshworker who already knows it, though you do not absorb the knowledge until you have practiced on a living humanoid or a humanoid corpse that has died within the past 24 hours (including a corpse affected by gentle repose, as long as it was cast within 24 hours of the creature's death). Once you have practiced a chirurgical procedure at least once, you can perform it at any time. The time required for each procedure is listed, during which time the patient must be incapacitated, restrained, or unconscious. A restrained or willing patient can remain awake during the procedure, though they automatically gain a level of exhaustion and are poisoned for the duration of the procedure and 1 hour afterward.

When performing chirurgery, you make one Wisdom (Medicine) check and one Intelligence (thieves' tools) check against the listed DC, the latter representing your skill at manipulating the body's intricate and delicate organic mechanisms. Two successful checks are required for a complete success and a single successful check produces a partial success. If all checks fail, the procedure goes horribly awry, resulting in malpractice and dire complications. If the result of any skill check is a natural 1 , the target must succeed at a Constitution saving throw (DC equal to the procedure's DC) or else the entire procedure results in malpractice regardless of the result of the other skill check. If two checks produce natural 1 s , malpractice automatically occurs and the patient dies if they fail their Constitution saving throw.

Each procedure has a DC, requires the listed amount of time to complete, and the listed number of uses of a healer's kit. Each use of a healer's kit represents 1 hour of working on a chirurgical procedure. When chirurgery begins, if a proper supply of healing kit is not available or the target is below 1 hit point all ability checks to perform the operation are made with disadvantage.

Chirurgical procedures are strenuous for the body. The patient gains 1 level of exhaustion that lasts for 1 week. When you exceed the procedure's DC by 5 or more, a patient's exhaustion only lasts for 1 day. In addition, after receiving a chirurgical procedure any checks to have another procedure performed on the same creature are made with disadvantage. Any saving throw DCs or spell attacks for effects that duplicate spells use your Intelligence as your spellcasting attribute.

Unless otherwise noted, all effects of a chirurgical procedure are permanent and many are damaging to the patient's psyche or the natural balance of their biological processes. This imbalance extends into the spiritual plane, and creatures who recently underwent mind-altering chirurgical procedures might have a greater than normal chance of arising as unquiet dead, perhaps haunts that spread madness and torment, or as actual undead creatures such as ghouls or, more rarely, ghosts or specters. For every chirurgical procedure a creature receives, its Sanctity score decreases by 1 and its Sin score increases by 1.

## ADJUST APPEARANCE

(DC 13, 1d4 days, 5 uses per day): Your surgery alters the outward appearance of a patient, changing their features or proportions as you deem fit (as disguise self).

---

You cannot change the patient's creature type (although the patient could be made to appear as another subtype, granting advantage on any ability checks made to impersonate a creature of that type). Otherwise, the extent of the apparent change is up to you. You could add or obscure a minor feature or change the patient to look like an entirely different person or gender.

Complete Success: The intended adjustment in appearance is achieved. If your appearance is changed to resemble another subtype or gender, your likeness is uncanny, granting the patient advantage on Deception checks and any other ability checks made to impersonate a creature of the chosen type. By spending 1 d 4 hours and 2 uses of a healer's kit, you can change the appearance of the patient to that of a different member of the same race that this procedure has altered them to appear like.

Partial Success: The intended adjustment in appearance is achieved but not with entirely desirable effects. The patient gains advantage on ability checks made to impersonate a creature of the chosen type but their sense of self is affected, reducing their Charisma by 1 . By spending 1 day and 5 uses of a healer's kit, you can change the appearance of the patient to that of a different member of the same race that this procedure has altered them to appear like.

Malpractice: The patient becomes horribly disfigured as grafts and adjustments become infected and necrotized while the disfigurement is also psychologically damaging. The patient reduces their Charisma score by 2 and contracts a vile disease.

Reversal: regeneration

## GRAFT FLESH

(DC 16, 2d4 hours, 1 use per hour): You surgically remove (if necessary) and replace some portion of the target creature's body with something else. The tissue you wish to engraft onto the patient must be fresh, ideally taken from a still living creature. For every
hour the tissue has been removed or the donor creature has been dead, all skill checks take a -1 cumulative penalty. If the affected tissue or creature is under a gentle repose spell, only time that elapsed before the spell was cast counts toward this penalty. Skeletal or corporeal undead creatures can have flesh grafted from other undead of the same type or from dead flesh (or bone, for skeletal undead) without facing this penalty.

Having alien flesh grafted is hard for the mind to accept. If the new limb is not essentially identical to the original limb (from the same creature type) the target makes a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or reduces its Wisdom by 1 after a graft is installed regardless of the chirurgery's success or failure.

Complete Success: You can replace a creature's natural weapon with a different one suited for the same limb (bite or gore for head; claw, slam, tentacle, or wing buffet for arm; claw or hoof for leg; sting or tail slap for tail). You can instead add a prehensile hand in place of a claw on an arm. These do not grant any features the original creature might have had. The natural weapon deals damage appropriate to the patient's size and you are able to transplant a natural weapon from a creature one size category larger or smaller. Whenever you add a natural weapon the creature did not previously possess, the patient is considered proficient with that natural weapon after 1 week.

If you graft wings onto a creature that previously lacked them, the patient can use them as natural weapons. Wings grafted this way are not functional for flight and instead reduce the damage the patient takes from falling by 3 per point of proficiency bonus it has.

A fleshworker may use this procedure to grant a creature a grafting feat as long as the patient possesses any prerequisite feats the grafting feat requires (none of the grafting feat's other prerequisites are needed).

By increasing the DC, you can add

---

one of the following specialized grafts:
DC 17: vestigial fins (the patient gains a swim speed equal to half their speed)
DC 18: functional fins (the patient gains a swim speed equal to their speed)
DC 19: bestial leverage (the patient gains a climb speed equal to their speed)
DC 20: functional gills (the patient can breathe both air and water)
DC 22: functional wings (requires two wings; the patient gains a fly speed equal to their speed)

Partial Success: The graft succeeds but a natural weapon takes a permanent -2 penalty to attack rolls and deals damage as one size smaller than normal.

Failure: The graft functions as a partial success but ultimately necrotizes and fails, rotting away after 2d4 days. The patient makes a DC 12 Constitution saving throw each day for 1 week, gaining the poison condition on a failure.

Malpractice: The patient's Intelligence is reduced by 2 and it gains amnesia.

Reversal: regeneration

## IMPLANT PSYCHIC TRIGGER

(DC 18, 1d4 days, 2 uses per day): You implant a psycho-neurological back-door designed to produce a certain behavioral reaction in the patient through the use of a triggering word, phrase, whistle, image, or song. Activating this trigger is a bonus action for you and can cause in the patient any form of insanity you choose, the compulsion to follow a suggestion (as the spell), or an urge to complete a geas/quest. If you use this procedure on a patient upon whom you have previously used the instill identity or lobotomize procedure, you gain advantage on checks to perform the operation and it requires only one day.

Complete Success: The key functions as desired, with the effects lasting for up to 1 d 4 hours. Completing a suggestion or geas/quest before this time ends the effect.

Partial Success: As a complete success, but the effect lasts only 4 d 10 minutes.

Failure: The reaction of the patient when the key is activated is random, as the confusion spell.

Malpractice: When the key is activated, the patient reduces its Intelligence, Wisdom, and

Charisma scores by 2 .
Reversal: heal or any effect that remedies insanity

# INDUCE AMNESIA 

(DC 17, 2d4 days, 3 uses per day): You can manipulate the patient's mind to selectively erase specific memories or to wipe its mind clean.

Complete Success: You may choose to erase or alter a memory (as modify memory) or to give the patient amnesia. Alternatively, you may erase the memory of a number of feats, spells, or class features equal to half your proficiency bonus, causing the patient to permanently lose access to them. Each feat, spell, or class feature to be erased receives a Wisdom saving throw (as modify memory).

Partial Success: As a complete success, but you may choose only to modify memory or induce amnesia.

Failure: Your mental manipulations have the desired effect but last for only 1 d 100 hours. In addition, the patient remembers your role in the corruption of its mind and permanently gains advantage on Wisdom saving throws made against you.

Malpractice: The patient reduces its Intelligence by 2 and gains amnesia.

Reversal: heal

## INSERT LIMBIC RESERVOIR

(DC 18, 2d4 hours, 5 uses): You implant a volatile cocktail of psychoactive compounds that you can unleash at a later time to drive the patient into a drug-fueled frenzy. You can refill the compounds in the limbic reservoir by using this procedure again, reducing the DC by 5 and requiring only 1 hour and 1 use of a healing kit. Refilling a limbic reservoir does not cause exhaustion or the poisoned condition as other procedures do.

Complete Success: You can insert up to 5 doses of any drug which then can be infused directly into the patient's subdural spaces for faster absorption and intensified effect. The beneficial numeric effects of
the drug are increased by $50 \%$, but the saving throw against addiction to the drug is increased by 2 . The reservoir can be activated with a manual switch as a bonus action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If the patient also has an implanted psychic trigger, that trigger can be used to activate their limbic reservoir in addition to (or, if you wish, instead of) its normal effect.

Partial Success: The limbic reservoir functions as above, but each activation consumes 1 d 3 doses of the drug. The addiction save DC of any drug used in the limbic reservoir is increased by 4 (instead of 2 ).

https://ia903405.us.archive.org/33/items/osw-map-location-vtt/Book\%20of\%20True\%201B41.pdf

---

Failure: The implantation process damages the target's brain, reducing its Intelligence and Wisdom scores by 1 . The limbic reservoir also begins to leak, delivering a dose of the drug every 1 d 6 hours even when not triggered. When triggered, there is a $50 \%$ chance that all remaining contents of the reservoir are released at once (reducing the patient's Intelligence and Wisdom scores by 1 again).

Malpractice: The limbic switch fails to function and the compounds within cause the target to reduce its Intelligence and Wisdom by 2.

Reversal: Ill effects from inserting a limbic reservoir can be remedied by the heal spell. The limbic reservoir itself, however, can only be removed with the surgery procedure.

## INSTALL KILL-SWITCH

(DC 21, 2d4 hours, 8 uses): You implant in the patient a permanent physical kill-switch of some kind, such as a removable heart plug or a razorchain loop around the spine.

Complete Success: Activating the kill-switch can be done remotely as a bonus action if the patient is adjacent, and as an action and bonus action if the patient is within 10 feet. The creature makes a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or takes an amount of damage equal to its Constitution ability score. Even if the target survives, it gains the grappled condition for 1 d 4 rounds and takes an amount of damage at the end of each of its turns equal to its Constitution ability score.

Partial Success: Activating the kill-switch is an action if the patient is adjacent and cannot be performed if the target is not adjacent. It otherwise functions as a complete success, but a patient that makes its saving throw is grappled for only 1 round and takes an amount of damage equal to its Constitution modifier (instead of Constitution score).

Failure: Activating the kill-switch is an action and bonus action if the patient is adjacent and cannot be performed if the target is not adjacent. It deals damage equal to the patient's Constitution modifier.

Malpractice: The patient lowers its Constitution score by 1 immediately upon completing the surgery. The kill-switch itself has no effect.

Reversal: Ill effects from an installed killswitch can be remedied by effects that cure hit points
(as normal). The kill-switch itself, however, can only be removed with the surgery procedure.

## INSTILL IDENTITY

(DC 21, 1 week, 10 uses): You create an entire false identity in the patient's mind, including a new name and new memories; unlike implanting a psychic trigger, however, this effect is permanent. The procedure allows you to create an entire false personality, which may be of a radically different alignment if desired, though the DC is increased by 1 for each step of difference between the patient's original alignment and the alignment of the alternate personality.
Complete Success: The new personality becomes the dominant personality and the patient gains advantage on saving throws to avoid changing personality.
Partial Success: The new personality does not replace the old one and whenever the patient completes a long rest, they roll randomly to determine which is dominant.

Failure: The new identity fails to form and the patient reduces its Wisdom and Charisma by 1 due to mental uncertainty, disruption, and warped sense of self.

Malpractice: The patient develops a new personality of the GM's choice (with a randomly determined alignment).

Reversal: none

## LOBOTOMIZE

(DC 19, 1d4 hours, 6 uses): You remove the frontal lobe of a creature's brain.

Complete Success: The patient's emotional centers are completely severed and isolated. The patient changes its Intelligence and Charisma scores to 1 but gains immunity the charmed and frightened conditions. The patient's diverted synapses cause it to make initiative checks and Intelligence checks with disadvantage.

Partial Success: The patient's emotional centers are deadened but not completely severed. The patient reduces its Intelligence and Charisma scores by 5 but gains advantage on saving throws made to resist the

---

charmed and frightened conditions. If the patient becomes charmed or frightened, there is a $50 \%$ chance they become confused (as the confusion spell) instead of the normal effect.

Malpractice: The patient is affected as the feeblemind spell and automatically contracts amnesia.

Reversal: heal or regeneration

## STIMULATE ADRENAL CORTEX

(DC 15, 1 minute, 5 uses): This procedure taps into the body's natural reserves of energy to fight off tiredness and to temporarily recover from extreme weariness, though the treatment may sap the target's energy and health once the rush wears off.

Complete Success: The patient heals 2 hit points per character level, removes a level of exhaustion, and recovers from the poisoned condition. A patient who is sleeping is immediately awakened (even if magically asleep) and an unconscious creature is stunned for a number of rounds equal to its Hit Dice plus its Constitution modifier (minimum 1 round) before lapsing back into unconsciousness.

Partial Success: The patient only heals 1 hit point per character level. In addition, after a number of hours equal to the patient's Constitution modifier (minimum 1 hour), the patient gains a level of exhaustion.

Failure: The patient only heals a number of hit points equal to its proficiency bonus. In addition, after a number of minutes equal to the patient's Constitution modifier (minimum 1 minute) the patient gains 2 levels of exhaustion.

Malpractice: The patient gains the benefits of the haste spell for a number of rounds equal to their Constitution modifier (minimum 1 round). However, once the effects end the patient gains 3 levels of exhaustion and takes 1 d 6 points of damage for each round spent hasted. The haste effect is not magical, cannot be dispelled, and cannot be ended voluntarily (though it can be suppressed by slow).

Reversal: Ill effects of stimulating the adrenal cortex can be removed by any effect that cures exhaustion or hit point damage.

Special: This procedure does not cause lasting exhaustion or the poisoned condition as other procedures do.
![img-32.jpeg](assets/Book%20of%20true%20Evil_img-32.jpeg)

## SURGERY

(DC 16, 1d4 hours, 5 uses): You can conduct surgery to repair major damage to the target's body and mind. After surgery, the patient gains 1 level of exhaustion for 1 day.

Complete Success: The patient heals 1d8 points of damage per character level (up to the patient's full normal hit point total).

Partial Success: The patient heals 1d4 points of damage per character level (up to the patient's full normal hit point total).

Failure: The patient heals 1 point of damage per character level (up to the patient's full normal hit point total).

Malpractice: The patient takes 1d6 points of damage and gains the poisoned condition for 1 day.

Reversal: Ill effects of surgery can be removed by any effect that cures hit points or the poisoned condition.

Special: You can also use surgery to amputate a limb, excise a tumor, or remove an implanted device. Other surgeries require the normal amount of time.

Amputation requires only 1d4 rounds. Each round during the surgery the creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or go unconscious for 1 d 4 minutes. Removal of a limb eliminates any natural weapon that is a part of that limb. Removal of an arm also precludes the use of two-handed weapons or any other action requiring two hands, spell attacks with somatic components are made with disadvantage, and saving throws to resist the spells with somatic components that an amputee casts are made with advantage. Removal of a leg reduces the patient's speed by half if they still have 2 or more ambulatory limbs remaining. If only one ambulatory limb remains, the patient can move only 5 feet per round.

Surgery can also be used to peel off natural armor, reducing a creature's $A C$ by 2 each time the procedure is performed (to a minimum of $10+$ Dexterity modifier).

Removing a tumor or lesion assists in curing a diseased character, granting the patient advantage to its next saving throw against a disease.

Surgery can also remove a magical tattoo or similar effect, as well as implanted mechanical devices such as a kill-switch or limbic reservoir. Such surgical removal requires the normal amount of time for a surgery and a complete success to be correctly removed.

# TALENTIA ENHANCER 

(DC 20, 3d4 hours, 10 uses): You install a device designed to specifically enhance particularities of your subject's body, bolstering their natural talents to ultimately make the patient more effective at whatever they already have a penchant for doing. Unlike other chirurgical procedures, a complete success or partial success is enough to install a talentia enhancer and there is no malpractice. However, a creature may only undergo this chirurgical procedure only once whether successfully or not; any further attempts automatically fail and without a successful DC 20 Constitution saving throw, the patient dies.

Barbarian: Iecur Liver. The barbarian's Constitution increases by 1 and they gain immunity to the poisoned condition as well as non-vile diseases.
Bard: Synthetic Vocal Cords. The bard can mimic animal sounds and humanoid voices. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful Wisdom (Insight) check (DC $8+$ the bard's proficiency bonus + the bard's Charisma modifier).
Cleric: Vocivus Actuators. The cleric can use their Channel Divinity to conjure a wave of dark power that roils forth and drains the life of creatures. As an action, the cleric twists their hands in an unnatural fashion before clenching them into fists that explode with stuff of the void, dealing 1 d 8 necrotic damage per point of proficiency bonus they possess. The cleric can choose to direct this energy at one creature within 60 feet or a number of creatures equal to their Wisdom modifier that are within 30 feet. A Wisdom saving throw against the cleric's spell save DC reduces this damage by half. A single creature targeted by this effect makes its saving throw with disadvantage and takes double damage if it fails its saving throw. This feature has no effect on undead or constructs.
Diabolist: Superno Proficiscentur. Thin leather scripts covered in Vilespeech are embedded throughout the diabolist's flesh, allowing them to channel unholy energies directly from the Abyss and Hell. The diabolist is able to summon 1 more diabolus at a time than normal.

Druid: Abeo Biologis. While the druid uses wild shape, they can spend a bonus action to activate or deactivate a viral infection tied to their soul. When active the druid's wild shape form is covered by an aura of dark red and purple energies, granting them 1 d 4 additional damage with natural attacks and increasing their AC by 2 .
Fighter: Offensionibus Spine. The fighter's Strength and Constitution increase by 1. In addition, they gain resistance to falling damage.
Mad Scientist: Adapertio Ocular Nerve. The mad scientist is able to cast the detect magic spell without components or concentration. By spending a bonus action, they can alter their ocular nerve to instead emulate the effects of detect evil and good or detect poison and disease.
Monk: Tenibrus Talons. The monk's ki pool increases by 1 and by spending a bonus action, they can deploy or retract talons that change their unarmed strike damage to slashing.
Occultist: Inanis Lancino. The occultist's Dark Strikes increase in potency, driven by miniature servos and pistons that deal an extra 2 (1d4) damage.
Paladin: Osseus Skeleton. The paladin's bones are seared with the ancient language of Vilespeech, the runes making it impossible to detect their true alignment. When a creature or effect would detect the paladin's alignment, they see an alignment of the paladin's choice.
Ranger. Argentum Eyes. The ranger's eyes become featureless silver orbs. They can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a distance of 60 feet (if they already have darkvision, its range increases by 60 feet).
Rogue: Currax Nerves. The rogue's Dexterity increases by 1 and their speed increases by 10.
Sorcerer: Devoco Glands. The sorcerer gains 1 sorcery point (if they do not yet have sorcery points, they gain an additional sorcery point when they acquire the class feature) and learns a cantrip. In addition, by spending a bonus action the sorcerer can convert 2 vllis points into 1 sorcery point.

---

Warlock: Festino Charge. The warlock's soul is imparted with dark energy that allows them to gain a second pact boon. Once chosen, this second pact boon cannot be changed.

Wizard: Prolixo Ganglia. The wizard's Intelligence increases by 1 , they learn a cantrip, and they gain advantage on saving throws when resisting the charmed and stunned conditions.

# FILESHWORKING FEATS 

To sculpt and transform flesh is considered by most to be a macabre delusion of medicine, the aspirations of only the most crazed and deranged practitioners of the healing arts. To others however, it is the most worthwhile expression of artistry or a critical tool in less than honorable trades.

## Anatomical Precision

Prerequisites: Proficiency with Medicine, sneak attack or surgical precision class feature
Your study of human and inhuman anatomies allows you to strike with deadly precision. As a bonus action, you can study the anatomy and movement style of a creature within 30 feet, making an Intelligence check appropriate to the creature's type, with a DC of $8+$ the target's CR. If successful, for the next minute you may add your Intelligence modifier to both attack rolls against the creature and damage rolls targeting it that use Sneak Attack or Surgical Precision.

Intelligence (Arcana): Aberration, Dragon, Monstrosity, Ooze
Intelligence (History): Construct, Giant
Intelligence (Nature): Beast, Elemental, Fey, Plant
Intelligence (Religion): Celestial, Fiend, Undead
Wisdom (Medicine): Goblinoid, Humanoid

## Anesthetist

Prerequisites: Proficiency with Medicine and poisoner's kit You are an expert at subduing a target with nonlethal poisons. You gain the following benefits:

- When you inflict unconsciousness with a poison, you increase the DC of saving throws made to resist it by 1 for every 2 points of proficiency bonus you possess, and if the unconsciousness caused by that poison has a variable duration that duration is always the maximum amount. When examining a creature rendered unconscious by such a poison, you can make a Wisdom (Medicine) check against the poison's save $\mathrm{DC}+5$ to determine how much time remains until the target awakens.
- You can also use the Medicine skill to ameliorate pain. As an action and bonus action, you can infuse or inject a creature with a mixture of pain-deadening compounds. After 1 minute, the target gains advantage on saving throws against fear and poison. This bonus lasts 1 hour.
Alternatively, you can provide a fast-acting sedative that provides the above benefits 1 round after being injected rather than 1 minute; however, the duration of the effect is reduced to 1 minute. If the target is already affected by a pain effect or is already frightened or poisoned, they can instead attempt a new saving throw (without advantage)

---

suppress the effect as long as the anesthesia lasts.
Once you have used this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier, you require a long rest before it can be used again.

## Practicing Chirurgeon

Prerequisites: Proficiency in Medicine and thieves' tools The work of fleshcraft is difficult and grisly, but not impossible for a common mind to master. After butchering a few corpses and one surviving living patient, you gain some control over the arts of chirurgy. You learn 1 chirurgical procedure, treating your level as your mad scientist level. You are able to learn more chirurgical procedures as a fleshworker mad scientist can, treating each as a 3rd-level spell. Any chirurgical procedure with DCs of 20 or higher is treated instead as a 5th-level spell.

## MUTANT FEATS

The following depraved and deviant feats are ideal for mad scientists and champions of genetic purity alike. In a campaign where mutants and mutation are common, the GM may opt to have these feats generally available to all characters.

## Mutagenic Summons

Prerequisites: Ability to cast at least 3 conjuration and 3 transmutation spells
Your magic transforms conjured creatures into hideous abominations. When you cast any conjuration (summoning) spell, you may apply the mana-wasted template (page 146) to the creature(s) you summon. Diabolists cannot use this to conjure mana-wasted diaboli.

## Xenophilia

You have an affection and affinity for the alien and the strange that borders on obsession. You gain the following benefits:

- A +2 bonus on ability checks against aberrations, and a +2 bonus on checks to activate items of alien manufacture or items that create a polymorph effect.
- A +1 increase to the saving throw DC of effects you create that cause a creature to gain the charmed condition (including those produced by magic items you wield or activate) when you use them against an aberration.
- You suffer a -2 penalty to saving throws against effects that cause you to become charmed by aberrations.


## Xenophobia

You have a hateful aversion to creatures that are strange and unknown, granting the following benefits:

- You have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) and Wisdom (Survival) checks made against aberrations.
- A +2 bonus on attack rolls against aberrations.
- You have advantage on saving throws to resist being charmed by aberrations.
- You gain a +1 increase to the saving throw DC of effects you create that cause a creature to gain the frightened condition (including those produced
by magic items you wield or activate) when you use them against an aberration.
- You suffer a -2 penalty to saving throws against effects that cause you to become frightened by aberrations.

"And lo, let us bask in the light of the Celestial Heroes may they ever show us the path to a brighter future." The priest—
resplendent in the gowns and robes of his station—bowed his aged head along with the rest of the congregation, closing
their eyes for a moment to pray for the blessings of the beatific Lellwyn Fethyrwal before the sermon begins in earnest.
Barely more than a shadow, Zayne flits from behind a pillar into the lee of a statue nearer the pulpit and if any of the
devout in the pews notice they make no sign of it. Reaching into his component pouch he grasps at the ruby acquired solely
for today, working his other hand into intricate gestures before slashing at his arm with the gem to tear a bleeding rent
across the flesh below his elbow.

As the sorcerer's spell begins taking hold the most elderly of the congregation cough loudly, prompting their priest
to look down disapprovingly and get all the louder. Zayne smiles—this pompous fool and his church are proving to be a
better target for sacrifice than he had could have hoped for. Disregarding the need for stealth now that the stage is set, the
halfling peeks around the marble column to see other parishioners beginning to feel the effects of his vile magic, backing
up blood that floats into the air. The anomaly does not go unnoticed by the people in the chapel and they start to leave as
they realize something is amiss, shuffling quickly towards the grand doors at its entrance.

Shouting consternation changes into agonized screams and Zayne knows that they have found his allies waiting
for them. Milling in confusion the crowd's cries raise to a crescendo as their blood coalesces into a crimson whirlwind,
dancing across the pews and masonry to the command of the halfling's little finger. A silence overcomes anyone engulfed
by the maelstrom, the sanguine razorstorm cutting through flesh and flensing them down to the bone to leave only cleaned
alabaster skeletons crumpling onto the floor in its wake. When the chaotic congregation sees the first of its ravaged
victims a riot breaks out, terrified parishioners climbing over one another in a blind panic to try and reach the stained-
glass windows. Between Zayne's lethal magic and the armor-clad warriors marching inexorably forward in a line of
swinging blades it is the only means of escape—far beyond their reach.

Kressyndria stalks behind his allies, the tiefling's razor-edged plate seeming to draw the shadows of the room
towards her as the blasphemous words she chants grow louder. For his part Zayne doesn't care whether or not this ritual
of hers works and he entertains himself instead by making his deadly spell dance across the hallowed chamber to rip
apart these confused fools, picking off the idiots trying to protect others to increase the dread of his next victims. This
is what his fiendkin companion has always failed to understand: real power is a thing of emotion, the soul of a living
creature peering across the veil when it bears witness to true horror. He would never proclaim that blood does not contain
considerable potency—Zayne's slaughtering whirlwind is proof enough of that—but it is only a catalyst, not a conduit.

With the congregation's numbers thinned to but a handful the halfling turns his attentions to the priest. As
Zayne expected he is scrabbling at the door to his reliquary room behind the pulpit, unsure of why it won't open to him
and panicking while the people he swore to lead perish not a hundred feet away. "Well then," the sorcerer travels, drawing
the anatheme from his belt, "nothing seems to be going right for you today."

The old man's eyes snap wide and he clutches at an icon of Saint Periplectomus hanging from his neck when he
turns to see Zayne with blade in hand, murder in the halfling's eyes. "Please!" he begs, "spare us! We have done no harm to
you!" Desperation bleeds from the aged priest's voice and Zayne drinks it in, the fear delicious to all of his senses. He can
see the hairs on his victim's knuckles stand on end, the pupils of the old man's eyes dilate to black saucers, smell ammonia
as a bladder long past its expiration date empties its contents onto the floor—the sorcerer consumes every detail like it is a
gourmet meal.

"Have you not?" the halfling asks with a cadence at odds to the grisly scene around them, a thrill revealed in his
exuberant tone. Zayne pulls a sickly green vial from his belt and uncorks it, pouring its contents onto
his anatheme before stalking closer to his terrified prey. "That's alright. I don't mind being first."

Vile spells are cruel and exploitative, bent to inflict unnatural pain or gain power from the suffering of victims. They manipulate blood, blaspheme existence, pervert the physical form, conjure evil entities, or worse.

Classes able to cast spells add all vile spells to their class spell list, but only creatures with a Sin ability score or evil alignment are able to cast spells from this school of magic without using a scroll or other magic item.

## EVIL AURAS

Vile spells leave an evil aura behind them, detectable with detect evil and good. If the caster has no Sin ability score, use double the spell level to determine the strength of the aura left behind. Evil auras dissipate 10 minutes for every spell level + a number of minutes equal to double the caster's Sin score.

For example, a vile spell of 3rd-level cast by a creature with a Sin score of 15 has an evil aura that lingers for 1 hour; a 3rd-level spell's evil aura lasts a minimum of 30 minutes, plus the caster's Sin of 15 doubled. A vile spell of 5th-level cast by a creature with a Sin score of 20 has an evil aura that lingers for 1 hour and 30 minutes; a 5th-level spell's evil aura lasts a minimum of 50 minutes, plus the caster's Sin of 20 doubled.

# ANCESTRAL PERVERSION 

7th-level vile
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (crushed gravestone powder)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Reaching back through time, you choose a creature you can see within range and call up from the ground ghastly visions of their loved ones. These wailing, malice-filled spirits are visible to all creatures. The target and all creatures within 30 feet of it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save the target is swarmed by the twisted forms of those they hold dear, taking 3d10 necrotic damage and 3d10 psychic damage. All other affected creatures take half of this damage (no saving throw).

The exact form this spell takes varies greatly depending on the target, though disappointed ancestors, deceased family members, and holloweyed children are common. They are always accompanied by the cold and stench of the grave, and often by trademark perfumes or scents. The loved ones of the target do not need to be dead to manifest, though they will appear so.

Creatures with an Intelligence of 5 or lower are unaffected by this spell.

You can also choose to spend 1 vilis point to inflict the stunned condition on the target creature for the duration of the spell. After failing its saving throw, at the end of each of its turns the creature makes a new saving throw to end the stunned condition.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th-level or higher, the damage increases by 1 d 10 necrotic damage and 1 d 10 psychic damage for each slot level above 7 th.

## AWAKEN HERESY

5th-level vile
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (pus from an infected wound)
Duration: 30 days
The blasphemy you speak reaches out and brands the soul of a creature you can see within range. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save the target gains an inherent heresy (pages 7-8). When casting this spell you can choose whether the creature gains an inherent heresy that you have or to roll to choose randomly. At the end of the duration, the creature
must make an additional Wisdom saving throw or the inherent heresy becomes permanent.

You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it. A remove curse, greater restoration, or wish spell also ends it

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7 th-level the duration is 1 year. When using a spell slot of 8 th-level the creature makes its second Wisdom saving throw with disadvantage. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 9th-level, the spell's duration lasts until it is ended by one of the spells mentioned above.
![img-34.jpeg](assets/Book%20of%20true%20Evil_img-34.jpeg)

## BLASPHEMOUS INFLUENCE

3rd-level vile
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a shard of broken mirror)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Pricking your finger with the shard of mirror, you bark out an irreverent word in Vilespeech and undermine the will of your target. For the duration of the spell, each round you can use your reaction to force a creature within range to reroll an ability check, saving throw, or attack roll, taking the lower result.

## BLOOD BULLETS

3rd-level vile
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 100 feet
Components: V, S, M (blood from the spellcaster)
Duration: instantaneous
When you cast this spell, you spill blood from your palm by drawing an enchanted pattern onto it with a weapon that deals piercing or slashing damage. Your blood rises from your hand and forms up to five bullets you fling at creatures you can see. Make a ranged spell attack against each target. On a hit, a target takes 2 d 8 piercing damage. The bullets all strike simultaneously, and you can direct them to hit one creature or several. Hit or miss, the blood bullet then explodes. Every target and each creature

---

within 5 feet of the point where a blood bullet exploded must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 2 d 6 necrotic damage.

You take 1 d 4 points of damage for each blood bullet formed. This damage cannot be avoided and ignores both resistances and immunities. Creatures that do not have any blood are unable to cast this spell.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd-level or higher, you form an additional blood bullet.

## BLOOD SPEAR

Vile cantrip
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (your recently spilled blood)
Duration: Instantaneous
As part of the casting of this cantrip, you inflict 2 points of damage to yourself. The blood from your self-inflicted injury forms into a sharpened spear of crimson that rapidly soars toward a creature within range, drying as it flies through the air. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1 d 12 piercing damage.

The spell creates more than one blood spear when you reach higher levels (you take 2 additional points of damage for every extra spear formed): two spears at 5 th level, three spears at 11 th level, and four spears at 17 th level. You can direct the spears at the same target or at different ones. Make a separate attack roll for each spear.

## BONE SPURS

2nd-level vile
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a handful of bones from an adolescent creature's skeleton)
Duration: 1 minute
You rend at the skeleton of a living creature you can see within range, causing it to grow serrated hooks that tear at its flesh. The target takes 2d6 slashing damage and must make a Constitution saving throw.

On a failed saving throw, each round on its turn if the creature moves and uses an action it takes 1d6 slashing damage. The creature takes no damage from this spell and receives a new saving throw at the end of its turn if it only moves or only uses an action. This spell does not affect reactions or bonus actions.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd-level or higher, the initial damage increases by 1 d 6 for each spell slot level above 1st.

## BONE WALL

6th-level vile or necromancy
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S, M (recently deceased creature's bone)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
A magical wall of solid bone, made from the skeletons and skulls of fallen warriors, springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall works the same way as a wall of stone with the following exceptions:

The wall doesn't need to be vertical or rest on any firm foundation. It must, however, connect to at least one solid point (though its weight is not an issue and it balances perfectly). Thus, you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.

Every turn that a creature touches the bone wall, it makes a Constitution saving throw or takes 2 d 8 necrotic damage.

The wall is an object made of bone that can be damaged and thus breached, though it has immunity to necrotic and psychic damage. Each panel has AC 12 and 20 hit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected panels to collapse at the GM's discretion, but these panels explode to deal 8d6 necrotic damage to any creature within 10 feet (a Constitution saving throw halves this damage).

## CONJURE DEMON

7th-level vile
Casting Time: 1 action

wound also closes if the target receives magical healing.
A target that takes a critical hit from your spell attack bleeds uncontrollably. The target has disadvantage on Constitution checks and Constitution saving throws until the bleeding wound is healed. In addition, whenever the target takes damage, it is stunned until the end of its next turn.

Components: V, S, M (an item from the corpse of the deceased relative)
Duration: 10 minutes (see text)
As part of the casting of this spell, you touch a creature related to another creature you have seen the corpse of or witnessed die. The target makes a Charisma saving throw or gains the frightened condition for 10 minutes as your despicable magic dredges up the most disturbing and horrifying vision possible of the relative that the corpse belonged to (perhaps depicting its greatest sins, gruesome death, transgressions against the target, or any other suitably disturbing scenario).

Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (a large tome)
Duration: Until dispelled or triggered
Summoning all of your knowledge of the horrid language known as Vilespeech, you replace the text of the tome spellcasting component with blasphemous heresies full of temptation. When a creature comes within 30 feet of the book (if it is in sight) it must make a Wisdom saving throw or be drawn to read the contents within. Whenever the book is opened, each creature in a 60 -foot radius other than the reader must make a Wisdom saving throw. A target takes 8d6 psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Once triggered, the words glow a sickly bluegreen for 10 minutes, after which time the spell ends. A creature other than the reader that enters this area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there is

also affected as above. In addition, the reader (by compulsion or choice) must make a second Wisdom saving throw or their alignment changes to evil (unaligned creatures become neutral evil) and they feel an urge to hide all evidence of their transformation. Creatures that fail the first saving throw have disadvantage on the second saving throw.

You must know Vilespeech in order to cast this spell.

## HERESY INCARNATE

9th-level vile
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S, M (chunk of diseased humanoid flesh)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Fell energies wrap around your body in a 60 -foot radius sphere of darkness and fanged, gaping maws that babble dark secrets in Vilespeech, causing your mere presence to warp and wound all around you. The sphere spreads around corners. A creature that starts its turn in the area or enters it must make a Wisdom saving throw. A creature takes 5 d 8 thunder damage and 5 d 8 psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The first time a creature takes damage from this spell it must roll on the Long-Term Madness table on a failed save (page 142), or on the Short-Term Madness table on a successful save (page 141).

This spell also deals its thunder damage to objects in the area.

## INSCRIBE VILESPEECH

3rd-level vile
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (page of humanoid-skin vellum)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
When you cast this spell, you picture an abhorrent message that etches across the vellum in Vilespeech that plants the seeds of chaos in the souls of all who bear witness to its blasphemy. After casting this spell, any creature that opens the vellum triggers the following effects. You can refine the trigger so the spell is activated only under certain circumstances or according to a creature's physical characteristics (such as height or weight), or type of creature (for example, the Vilespeech could be set to affect humans or shapechangers). You can also specify creatures that don't trigger the Vilespeech, such as those who say a certain password.

Once triggered, every creature in a 20 -foot radius must make a Wisdom saving throw or have their gaze drawn to the blasphemous words. On a failed save, a creature takes 6 d 6 psychic damage and is either insane ( $25 \%$ ) or enraged ( $25 \%$ ) until it takes a short rest. A remove curse spell cast on the creature ends this effect. On a successful save a creature takes half damage but is otherwise unaffected.

While insane, a creature can't take actions, read, speak anything but gibberish, or understand what other creatures say. The GM controls the creature's movement, which is erratic.

While enraged, a creature must attack the nearest other creature that it can see to the best of its ability, can't understand what other creatures say, and speaks only in gibberish. If no other creature is in sight, the creature attacks itself.

You must know Vilespeech in order to cast this spell.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th-level or higher, the damage increases by 1 d 6 for each slot above 3 rd.

## INSIDIOUS INDOCTRINATION

Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (hourglass filled with 125 mL of an intelligent humanoid's cerebrospinal fluid)
Duration: 24 hours (see text)
You shape the psychic space in a radius 30 -feet across, warping it inward to melt the mental defenses of one restrained creature that you can see. So long as the creature remains restrained throughout, you gain the following benefits for the spell's duration:

- The completion times for the implant psychic trigger, induce amnesia, and instill identity chirurgical procedures (pages 86, 87, and 89) are reduced from days to hours.
- You have advantage on Wisdom (Medicine) checks and Intelligence (thieves' tools) checks made to use the above chirurgical procedures.
- Your patient does not gain exhaustion from the implementation of chirurgical procedures.
- Successive chirurgical procedures targeting the same patient are not made with disadvantage.
- While this spell and its direct effects are magical, chirurgical procedures performed during the duration are still mundane.

# LESSER INSCRIBE VILESPEECH 

1st-level vile
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (a piece of humanoid-skin
vellum)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Forming the odious sigils in your mind, you cause letters of Vilespeech to appear on the vellum, maddening the souls of those that see it. After casting this spell, any creature that opens the vellum triggers the following effects. You can refine the trigger so the spell is activated only under certain circumstances or according to a creature's physical characteristics (such as height or weight), or type of creature (for example, the Vilespeech could be set to affect humans or shapechangers). You can also specify creatures that don't trigger the Vilespeech, such as those who say a certain password.

Once triggered, every creature within a 15 -foot cone must make a Wisdom saving throw or find its gaze drifting to the Vilespeech. Creatures takes 2d6 psychic damage on a failed save and gain a short-term madness (page 141). This madness lasts for 1 d 10 minutes, though the Vilespeech only retain their ability to affect new targets for 1 minute after being triggered. A lesser restoration spell cast on the creature removes this madness. On a successful save a creature takes half damage but is otherwise unaffected.

You must know Vilespeech in order to cast this spell.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd-level or higher, the psychic damage increases by 1 d 6 for each spell slot above 1st.

## KNEELING CUR

1st-level vile
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (four grains of rice)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You exploit the cowardice of the soul, forcing a living creature to cower and grovel before you. Pick one creature you can see within range. It must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature falls prone. As long as the creature can see you, it cannot stand. A creature that averts its eyes gains the blinded and frightened conditions but can stand up and move until it is able to see you again, at which point it falls
prone and is no longer blinded or frightened.
At the end of each of its turns and each time it takes damage, the creature can make another Wisdom saving throw. The creature has advantage on the saving throw if it's triggered by damage. On a success, the spell ends.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd-level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

## MARK OF UNSPEAKABLE HORROR

7th-level vile
Casting Time: 1 action

Make a melee spell attack against a creature within your reach. On a hit, the creature takes 10d6 psychic damage as a fiendish mark is seared into its flesh and psyche, forcing it to gain a long-term madness (page 142). Enemies adjacent to the target take half of the psychic damage and gain a short-term madness (page 141).

---

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using an 8th-level spell slot, you can also force the creature to roll twice on the Long-term Madness table and take the result you prefer. When you cast this spell using a 9th-level spell slot, the creature must roll twice on the Long-term Madness table and take both results.

## SANGUINE RAZORSTORM

5th-level vile
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (your recently spilled blood and a blood ruby worth 42 gp )
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute As part of the casting of this spell, you inflict 2 d 6 points of damage to yourself. The blood from your self-inflicted wound explodes and propagates into a 20 -foot-radius whirlwind of razor-sharp droplets centered on a point you choose within range. The blood whirlwind lasts for the duration or until strong wind disperses it, ending the spell.

The area of the spell is heavily obscured. When a creature enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 5 d 10 slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

If a creature other than an undead or a construct rolls a natural 1 on its saving throw, it becomes wounded and loses 2 d 6 hit points at the start of each of its turns. Any creature can stanch the wound as an action with a successful Wisdom (Medicine) check against your spell save DC. The wound also closes if the target receives magical healing.

The blood whirlwind moves 10 feet at the start of each of your turns in a direction of your choosing.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th-level or higher, the damage increases by 1 d 10 for each spell slot level above 5th.

## SAVAGE BREAK

2nd-level vile
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (a tiny vial of cow's milk)
Duration: Instantaneous
You magically yank a bone out of one creature and hurl it at another. Choose one creature you can see
within range that has bones. It must make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails the saving throw, the creature takes 4 d 6 piercing as one of its smaller bones breaks and erupts out of its body. You can immediately make a ranged spell attack to hurl the broken bone at another creature you can see within 30 feet of the first that failed its saving throw. If the attack hits the second creature, it deals 2 d 6 piercing damage.

On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and no bones are ripped from its body.

At Higher Levels. If you cast this spell using a 5th-level spell slot and the target fails its saving throw, you pull two bones out of the spell's initial target, dealing 8 d 6 piercing damage, and can make two spell attacks at one or more other creatures within 30 feet of the target, each dealing 3 d 6 piercing damage on a hit.

If you cast this spell using an 8th-level spell slot and the target fails its saving throw, you pull three bones out of the spell's initial target, dealing 12d6 piercing damage, and can make three spell attacks at one or more other creatures within 30 feet of the target, each dealing 4 d 6 piercing damage on a hit.

A creature can only be damaged by this spell once per casting.

# UNHOLY CONDEMNATION 

8th-level vile
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 150 feet
Components: V, S, M (skull from a member of the clergy)
Duration: Instantaneous
You reach into the depths of your blackened soul and pass judgment on all those who have eschewed your dark path. Vile energies burst forth in a 60 -foot radius centered on a point you choose in range. Only good or neutral (not evil) creatures can be harmed by the spell. Each such creature in this area must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 12 d 8 necrotic damage and is poisoned for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't poisoned. Celestial creatures have disadvantage on this saving throw. Neutral and unaligned creatures take half damage on a failed save or one-quarter damage on a successful save.

## UNHOLY GAZE

Vile cantrip
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: S, M (pinch of sulfur)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You target one creature able to see you and that you can see within range, forcing it to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, once before the spell ends, you can use your reaction to roll 1d4 and subtract the number rolled from an ability check or attack roll made by the target. You can choose to use this feature after the creature makes its roll, but before the GM determines whether the attack roll or ability check succeeds or fails.

The number of times this cantrip can be used while it is concentrated upon but before it is expended increases to twice at 5 th level, three times at 11 th level, and four times at 17 th level.

## SPELLS OF MUTATION

Spells of the polymorph subschool form the core of the magic of changing that causes most of the mutations in a fantasy campaign. However, magic can also be a gateway to more pseudo-scientific processes that power the evolutionary engine, such as toxic chemicals and radiation.

## BLIGHTCORE MELTDOWN

8th-level conjuration (sorcerer, wizard)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 100 feet
Components: V, S, M (100 gp of powdered bloodstone)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You create a coruscating mass of blightburn crystal that pulsates with a bright green radiance, casting deadly emanations throughout the area. Each round a creature begins its turn within the blightcore meltdown, it takes 2 d 6 points of fire damage and must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or contract blightburn sickness.

Disease: Blightburn Sickness. A creature makes an initial Constitution saving throw to contract the disease (above) and any subsequent Constitution saving throws are at DC 20. At the end of its next long rest, a creature with this disease makes its saving throw or lowers its Constitution and Charisma scores by 1. A creature naturally fights off this disease by making 2 consecutive successful saving throws to resist it.

Creatures protected by a force effect (such as mage armor or shield) take only

## MUTATION MAGIC

1st-level: unstable isotope
2nd-level: fleshcurdle
3rd-level: mutagenic reversion
5th-level: mutagenic mist, mutation, summon borde of flesh
6th-level: genetic purification
7th-level: one of us
8th-level: blightcore meltdown, mass mutation
9th-level: mutant plague
only half damage and gain temporary immunity to blightburn sickness for a number of rounds equal to the spell level of the force effect they are using. After this time, the blightburn radiation penetrates the force effect and creatures within are exposed to full damage and blightburn sickness, though they have advantage on their saving throw against contracting the disease. If a creature is using multiple force effects, add the total spell levels of all force effects to determine how long it takes the blightburn radiation to penetrate.

The presence of the blightcore meltdown interferes with teleportation effects of all kinds, including not only actual teleportation but also planar

travel and calling and summoning effects. Any such effect cast within-or cast so as to cause creatures to appear within-the area of a blightburn meltdown requires an ability check ( $1 \mathrm{~d} 20+$ the opposing spellcaster's spellcasting ability modifier) against a DC of $15+$ your spellcasting ability modifier or the effect fails.

Finally, a blightcore meltdown greatly enhances polymorph effects or effects that alter the size of a living target within the area. The targets of such effects have disadvantage on their saving throws but gain double their normal benefit (shrinking twice in size if reduced, doubling in size if enlarged, etc.). Such effects are more tenacious and difficult to remove as well, causing checks made to dispel or remove them to have disadvantage.

## FLESHCURDLE

2nd-level transmutation (sorcerer, warlock, wizard)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (scrap of pickled flesh)
Duration: 1 minute
You warp the flesh of a target creature within range, discoloring it and causing it to become misshapen and impairing its function. When you cast this spell, you must choose one of three types of effects to inflict on the target-movement, attacks, or defense. A target that succeeds on a Constitution saving throw only suffers from this spell for 1 round.

Attacks. One of the creature's natural attacks suffers a -2 penalty on attack and damage rolls.
Defense. The creature's natural armor bonus decreases by 2 (minimum bonus of +0 ).
Movement. One of the creature's movement speeds (chosen by you) is halved.

Most undead are susceptible to fleshcurdle, but amorphous creatures and creatures without flesh are immune (such as elementals, oozes, plants, gaseous or incorporeal creatures, and skeletons).

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a higher level spell slot, you force the target to make one additional saving throw, incurring a second effect on a failure (to a maximum of 3 saving throws).

## GENETIC PURIFICATION

6th-level transmutation (cleric, sorcerer, wizard)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (100 gp of powdered bloodstone)
Duration: Instantaneous
This spell eradicates genetic impurities, purging the target's cellular essence of taint and mutation. Genetic purification eliminates disease from the target; however, supernatural diseases or diseases that are also curses are removed only temporarily (normally 1 week) and may recur if the curse or supernatural effect that caused the disease is not removed. This spell also negates any polymorph effect currently affecting the target (an unwilling target may resist the effect with a successful Constitution saving throw).

The spell can also be used to permanently purge the genetic material of the target, instantaneously transforming a part-human creature such as an aasimar, half-elf, half-orc, ifrit, oread, sylph, tiefling, or undine into a full-blooded human. In terms of game statistics, the target is affected as a dead creature returned to life as a human by a reincarnate spell. A half-elf or half-orc can instead be polymorphed into a full-blooded elf or orc (as appropriate).

Alternatively, genetic purification can

# MUTAGENIC MIST 

5th-level conjuration (sorcerer, warlock, wizard)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a potion of a transmutation spell)
Duration: 1 minute
You create a bank of multihued mist that shifts constantly in color and turgidity, obscuring vision as fog cloud. Creatures have disadvantage on saving throws against polymorph spells or effects.

Any creature beginning its turn within the mutagenic mist makes a Constitution saving throw or is affected as fleshcurdle, acquiring a randomly determined deformity (equal chance of offense, defense, or movement, rolling randomly to determine the specific deformity if a creature possesses more than natural weapon or more than one form of movement). A creature failing multiple saving throws can acquire multiple deformities from the mutagenic mist. These deformities remain for 1d6 rounds after a creature leaves the mutagenic mist.

## MUTAGENIC REVERSION

3rd-level transmutation (cleric, sorcerer, warlock, wizard)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a container that once held a magical potion)
Duration: 1 minute
This spell causes a creature mutated by magical forces to revert to its normal state (or at least partially back to normal for a severely mutated creature) if it fails its Constitution saving throw. This spell suppresses the effects of one polymorph effect or effect which changes the target's size (enlarge/reduce, giant insect, etc.), plus an additional such effect for every 5 levels you possess.

## MUTANT PLAGUE

9th-level transmutation (sorcerer, wizard)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a vial of blood from two mana-wasted mutants of different creature types)
Duration: instantaneous
Choose a number of creatures equal to your level that you can see within range. All targets that fail a Constitution saving throw are instantly infected with mana fever, and
they become highly infectious carriers of a deadly mutagenic plague. As long as a carrier has its Charisma reduced by at least 1 , they remain unaware of their illness. If their Charisma restored without curing their disease, they become aware of their condition. A carrier's disease is difficult to remove, requiring an ability check ( $1 \mathrm{~d} 20+$ spellcasting ability modifier) against your spell save $\mathrm{DC}+3$.

Disease: Mana fever. A creature makes an initial Constitution saving throw (as above) and any subsequent saving throws are at your spell save $\mathrm{DC}+3$. At the end of its next long rest, a creature with this disease makes its saving throw or lowers its Constitution score by 1d3 and its Charisma score by 1d3. A creature naturally fights off this disease by making 2 consecutive successful saving throws to resist it.

As long as a carrier is infected by the disease from this spell, it can spread the mutant plague to any creature it damages with its natural weapons. Each round a target takes damage from a carrier's natural weapons (regardless of how many natural weapons hit), that target must making a Constitution saving throw or become infected with the common version of mana fever, which is less virulent than the original strain imparted by the mutagenic meltdown and can be cured as any other supernatural disease. At the GM's discretion, creatures that share food or drink or have sexual contact with the carrier must also save or contract mana fever.

Mana fever is a supernatural disease and cannot be healed or cured without the aid of magic. Anyone who lives with mana fever for a week straight without dying becomes immune to the disease, but also becomes a mana-wasted mutant (page 146).

## MUTATION

5th-level transmutation (sorcerer, warlock, wizard)
Casting Time: 1 action

[Continued on page 107.]

---

1 Oversized Limb. One of the target's limbs becomes unnaturally large and strong. Any natural weapons the target has with that limb increase in damage as if the target were one size category larger. In addition, the target can wield weapons one size category larger than normal without any penalty and gains a +2 bonus to Strength ability checks made with that limb.
2 Oversized Maw. The target gains a bite natural weapon attack that deals 1d4 piercing damage (1d3 if Small-sized, 1d6 if Large-sized). If the target already has a bite attack, it deals damage as if it were one size category larger.
3 Quick Metabolism. The target gains a +2 racial bonus on Constitution saving throws, advantage on saving throws against poison, and disadvantage on saving throws to avoid the effects of starvation and thirst.
4 Thick Skin. The target's AC increases by 2.
5 Vestigial Limb. The target gains a vestigial third arm. This arm can hold objects but cannot wield them. The target has advantage on checks made to grapple.
6 Vestigial Twin. A malformed twin's head juts out from the target's trunk (usually but not always near the target's existing neck), granting the target advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks (and increasing its passive Perception by 5). If using flanking rules, the target cannot be flanked so long as it can see.
7 Night Sight. After 10 minutes being in darkness, the target gains darkvision but loses all other forms of sight. When exposed to more than dim light for 10 minutes, the target loses its darkvision and regains its regular forms of sight.
8 Gills. The target sprouts gills that allow them to breathe water, with a $50 \%$ chance to gain the amphibious special quality, able to breathe air and water equally well. If the target does not become amphibious however, their gills interfering with their normal breathing apparatus causing them to gain the poisoned condition as long as they remain outside of water.
9 Cave Sight. The target gains darkvision with a range of 60 feet, though they have a $50 \%$ chance to acquire sunlight sensitivity (see below) 1d4 days later. Removing one effect removes both effects.
10 Tail. The target grows a tail. While not prehensile, the tail grants a +2 bonus on Strength (Athletics) and Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks.
11 Deformed Hand. One forelimb becomes crippled, able to hold items but not wield them. The target takes a -2 penalty on Strength (Athletics) checks and attack rolls with two-handed weapons, including ranged weapons such as bows and firearms (not including pistols). A shield can still be strapped to the deformed arm, but its bonus to AC is reduced by 1 (minimum 0 ). Any natural attack involving the affected limb is made with a -2 penalty on attack rolls, and damage is reduced as if the attacker were one size category smaller.
12 Glass Jaw. The target takes a -2 penalty on saving throws related to critical hits, death from massive damage, or becoming stunned.
13 Sunlight Sensitivity. While in sunlight, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
14 Obese. The target takes a -2 penalty to Dexterity (minimum score of 1) and its base walking speed is reduced by 5 feet.
15 Light Blindness. At the start of each turn the target is in sunlight, it makes a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or is blinded until the start of its next turn.
16 Stunted Legs. The target's base land speed is reduced by 10 feet (minimum base speed of 5 feet).
17 Aural Overgrowth. The target's ears become swollen, drooping, and riddled with tumorous growths, causing it to become deafened.
18 Weak Mind. The target's head becomes misshapen and deformed, and its brain swollen in some places and compressed in others. It takes a -2 penalty on Intelligence saving throws and ability checks.
19 Ocular Degeneration. The target's eyes wither and shrivel, causing the target to become blinded.
20 Malformed Organs. The target's organs are grossly out of place and filled with squamous tumors, greatly impairing its ability to recover from illness or injury. Any critical hits or precision-based damage (like Sneak Attack or Martial Advantage) against the target is $25 \%$ likely to be negated. However, the target has disadvantage on saving throws against poison and diseases, and it heals only half the normal amount of hit points when healing naturally in a short or long rest.

---

You may choose to impair the target's offense or movement more than once; however, each time you must choose a different natural weapon or a different form of movement. The effects do not stack.

You may bestow a permanent mutation upon the target, determined randomly from the following table. Regardless of which mutation occurs, it is accompanied by a permanent deformity that wracks body, mind, and soul, reducing the target's Charisma by 2 . A creature cannot gain the same mutation more than once (regardless of whether it is harmful or beneficial) unless the mutation affects a single appendage, in which case it can be gained once for each appendage (affecting each one separately).

At the GM's discretion, the spellcaster may research additional mutations to inflict, or the GM may devise additional harmful mutations which could occur when using this spell. Such additional mutations should be similar in scope and effect to those described above. Mutations cannot be dispelled, but, genetic purification, regeneration, wish, or any effect that specifically removes polymorph effects can reverse its effects.

## MUTATION, MASS

8th-level transmutation (sorcerer, wizard)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a lump of melted wax infused with blood)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute (see text) This spell functions as mutation but affects multiple creatures, no two of which are more than 30 feet apart. Targets need not be of the same type or subrace, nor must they all acquire the same deformities (if using the temporary fleshcurdle-like effect) or mutations (if choosing to cause permanent mutation). However, if all targets are of the same type (and subtype, if applicable) and you choose to make all

108
of the deformities or mutations inflicted by the spell the same for all targets, all targets have disadvantage on their saving throw.

## ONE OF US

7th-level transmutation (sorcerer, wizard)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (the blood of a polymorphed creature)
Duration: Permanent
The target makes a Constitution saving throw or you forcibly impose the mana-wasted template on it, transforming it into a warped and deformed mockery of its true form (page 146). In addition, a creature
transformed by this spell must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or gain the charmed condition. The charmed target can always understand your speech (even if you do not share a language), treating you as a trusted friend and ally. However, a creature transformed by one of us retains a dim memory of your role in its transformation from something else, with a seed of rage against you ready to be ignited if shocked back to its senses.

Whenever the target takes a critical hit or succeeds on a saving throw against an enchantment effect, it can attempt a Wisdom saving throw as a reaction to break free of your charm for 1 d 12 hours, permanently breaking it if it rolls a natural 20 on the die. The charm effect can be dispelled with dispel magic, but it returns after 1 d 12 hours unless the curse is removed with greater restoration or a similarly powerful healing spell. The physical transformation caused by this spell cannot be dispelled but can be removed with genetic purification or wish.

# SUMMON HORDE OF FLESH 

5th-level conjuration (sorcerer, warlock, wizard)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a broken bone)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You summon 1d4-1
(minimum 1) hungry
mounds of flesh (use the statistics for Ochre Jelly
Oozes). The summoned creatures understand your speech and obey your commands. This spell otherwise functions as conjure minor elementals.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a higher level spell slot, you summon 1 additional hungry mound of flesh.

## SUMMON MUTANTS

4th-level conjuration
(sorcerer, warlock, wizard)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a broken bone)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
This spell functions as conjure animals except that the creatures you summon all have the mana-wasted template (page 146).

## UNSTABLE ISOTOPE

1st-level conjuration (sorcerer, warlock, wizard)
Casting Time: 1 bonus action
Range: Personal
Components: V, S, M (powdered iron and powdered crystal worth 10 gp )
Duration: 1 round (see text)
You create a tiny mass of unstable blightburn crystal, allowing you to enhance the effect of a transmutation spell before the end of your next turn through a calibrated emission of blightburn radiation. The companion transmutation spell must be one that affects a living creature, is normally harmless, and uses a spell slot at least 1 level lower than your highest spell level. If you do not cast an appropriate transmutation spell by the end of your next turn,

## DISILPETE CHNOFOGA

3rd-level abjuration (all spell lists)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (the dried husk of a beetle)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You cover the targeted object (a technological device like power armor, a clockwork limb, or a vehicle) or creature (constructs such as a rehabilibot or aesgigas sanctus) in a fine mist. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. Unattended objects automatically fail. On a failed save the target is rendered unusable or paralyzed (if a construct) for the duration of the spell.
the unstable isotope becomes inert and disintegrates without effect.

If you use an appropriate companion spell before the end of your next turn, roll 1d20 and add your spellcasting ability modifier. The spell is enhanced as though your you had cast it using a spell slot 1 higher for a result of 10,2 spell slots higher for a result of 15,3 spell slots higher for a result of 20 , and 4 spell slots higher for a result of 25 or more. If you roll a natural 1 on this check, the target of the companion spell is exposed to an overdose of blightburn radiation and must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or contract blightburn sickness.

Disease: Blightburn Sickness. A creature makes an initial Constitution saving throw to contract the disease (above) and any subsequent Constitution saving throws are at DC 20. At the end of its next long rest, a creature with this disease makes its saving throw or lowers its Constitution and Charisma scores by 1 . A creature naturally fights off this disease by making 2 consecutive successful saving throws to resist it.

Unstable isotope has no effect if the companion spell targets a creature that is protected by a force effect (including mage armor, shield, or bracers of defense).

The interior of Porthos' shop is the highlight of Hyrindrack Lane and the machinist never tires of passerby gawking at his wares, but this particular woman makes his skin crawl and he wants her out of his store as soon as possible. It's not that she isn't comely-far from it-but something in her eyes is cruel instead of kind, as though they were a window to the void instead of her soul. Her not unpleasant voice breaks his reverie, one slender arm pointing to a collection of metal plates magnetized around a small rod, "and this? What does it do?"

Thinking that he might subtly get her outside by blocking her way, Porthos saunters towards her with his arms behind his back, his pride in the device all too obvious. "A magnohydramicus, madame. They aren't used often these days but the first were designed to protect commanders back when the blessed Celestial Heroes were still making war. Observe, if you will." He takes the contraption and presses in the activator stud before placing it on the floor, looking back at her briefly and smiling reassuringly as it powers on. The metal discs fly into the air and create a flowing field of metal around them, navigating perfectly about tables, legs of furniture, and other devices of note. After a moment of taking in the impressive display Porthos decides she's seen enough and he deactivates the machine, placing it back on the table and saying to her, "It's a fine invention and should you wi-"

But she was gone.
Relieved but slightly confused Porthos quickly spins about looking for her and only catches the woman from out of the corner of his eye as she finishes what must be a spell, his closing eyes drawn to her hiding place as the magic pulls him into the darkness of sleep.

Porthos' awakens to the smell of charring wood, black smoke burning his nostrils and choking his lungs, and a member of the Conlatus 17th Fire Brigade bursting from out of the blaze around him. The burly dwarf grabs him by the collar of his shirt, dragging the machinist out of the conflagration and into a group of waiting Justitia. In short order the flames of Porthos' shop are quenched and he is tended to, his wounds minor and easily treated while officers take his statement. There is no suspicion that he may have set the fires himself-he nearly perished and he has long been an upstanding member of the community-but none are certain of who the woman might be or that she is responsible.

The next day Porthos stirs early in the morning, arriving to the burnt out busk of his shop and sifting through the remains. To his disappointment very little survived the fire-even his prized refurbished power armor is no more-and this will be a lean year, even with The Ministry's charity. Weary in both body and spirit, Porthos heads to a neighbor's cafe and takes a seat at a table outside, picking up a discarded newspaper with the hope of finding something profitable to do in the classifieds section.

Porthos doesn't get that far, enraptured instead by the headline on the front page: MANIAC SHE-DEVIL CRIME SPREE WRECKS THE BARRINGER DISTRICT. His hands begin to tingle with numbness as he reads the article, powerless to stop himself; the woman was clad in power armor, using a magnohydramicus, wielding a silver power rifle...all items missing from the inventory of his shop. With every paragraph his anxiety grows until Porthos stands upright and drops the sheets of paper, bolting towards the Tower of Law to tell the Justitia his fears after sifting through the wreckage of his shope one last time.

Rounding the corner back onto Hyrindrack Lane and stepping into the charred skeleton of the shop, Porthos doesn't notice he's not alone. Shuddering nervously as he kicks through piles of ash and debris looking for clues that maybe his devices played no part in the havoc last night, he fails to bear the footsteps of another. Only when the woman reveals herself does the machinist realize she's come back-stolen power rifle in hand, red lightning dancing across the surface of the weapon and onto the piffered suit of power armor she's wearing-but then the weapon surges, spitting out a bolt of energy that strikes Porthos square in the forehead and sends him into a darkness from which he'll never awaken.

# DRUGS 

Unlike curatives, the following drugs are all addictive narcotics normally found only in hospitals, medical offices, or in the hands of torturers.

## INCITAMENTUM

Usually found in aerosol form, possession of this highly illegal and incredibly addictive narcotic carries the most severe penalties. Administering a dose of incitamentum (an action) grants the imbiber a +2 bonus to AC, advantage on Dexterity saving throws, a 20 foot increase to speed, and starting at the beginning of the imbiber's next turn an additional action each round. After 1d4+3 rounds the imbiber becomes slowed (as the slow spell) for 2d4+2 minutes.

Upon taking a short or long rest, the imbiber makes a Constitution saving throw (DC $16+1$ per use of incitamentum in the past week) or is compelled to take more incitamentum. When the imbiber goes without another dose of incitamentum, they cannot take the Dash action and have disadvantage on Dexterity ability checks. After 24 hours (and again every 24 hours) the imbiber can make a new saving throw to resist incitamentum addiction.

## LAXITAS

When inhaled as an action, laxitas provides an overwhelming sense of euphoria and recklessness for 1 d 4 hours - 1 hour per dose taken in the previous day (minimum 10 minutes). The purest laxitas is exhorbitantly expensive but triggers an extreme adrenaline rush, granting the imbiber advantage on all ability checks and immunity to the fear condition for 1 hour.

After taking any amount of laxitas the imbiber gains a level of exhaustion and upon taking a long rest, their Wisdom is reduced by 1 (healed by a remove curse) and they make a Constitution saving throw (DC $15+1$ per use of laxitas in the past day) or are compelled to take more. When the imbiber goes without another dose of laxitas, they cannot take the Dodge action and have disadvantage on Charisma ability checks. After 24 hours (and again every 24 hours) the imbiber can make a new saving throw to resist laxitas addiction.

## MANSIO

Use of this hallucinogenic is highly regulated by The Ministry, the secrets of its creation closely guarded by agents of The Inquisition. By spending an action, the imbiber makes a Constitution saving throw (DC $8+$ 4 per use of mansio in the past week) and becomes incapacitated for 1 hour. On a failed save the imbiber gains the poisoned condition until completing a long rest. While incapacitated by mansio, the imbiber gains advantage on ability checks related to divination magic, remains able to concentrate on divination spells, and doubles the duration of divination spells they are concentrating on.

Upon taking a short or long rest, the imbiber makes a Constitution saving throw (DC $8+3$ per use of mansio in the past week) or is compelled to take more mansio. When the imbiber goes without another dose of mansio, they cannot cast divination spells and have disadvantage on checks made to concentrate on spells. After 24 hours (and again every 24 hours) the imbiber can make a new saving throw to resist mansio addiction.

## NIGRUM POLLINIS

When smoked over the course of a minute (or ingested as an action if made into liquid form) the imbiber feels a sense of euphoria, gaining 10 temporary hit points and advantage on Constitution saving throws for 1 hour.

After its effects cease, the imbiber makes a Constitution saving throw (DC $10+1$ per dose of nigrum pollinis in the last month) or gains a level of exhaustion. This exhaustion remains until the imbiber takes more nigrum pollinis or makes another saving throw 24 hours later. The imbiber gains advantage on saving throws against addiction to nigrum pollinis as long as they do nothing but rest during this period.

## NITRIKALI

By spending an action drinking this fizzing potion, the imbiber restores one 2nd-level or lower spell slot for spontaneous casters. Creatures that cannot benefit from this restored spell slot instead gain a 10 foot increase to speed for 1 hour and advantage on their next saving throw.

Upon taking a short or long rest, the imbiber makes a Constitution saving throw (DC $10+5$ per use of nitrikali in the past week) or is compelled to take more nitrikali. When the imbiber goes without another

---

dose of nitrikali, the next time they regain spell slots they regain 1 fewer spell slot per spell level (though the imbiber retains at least 1 spell slot per spell level they can cast). After 24 hours (and again every 24 hours) the imbiber can make a new saving throw to resist nitrikali addiction.

## PROELIO

This cocktail of stimulants and painkillers makes those who use it a dangerous companion to travel beside-proelio addicts are often violent and will do absolutely anything in order to acquire more of the drug. As an action a creature can expel this drug into their lungs (if an aerosol) or inject it into their bloodstream (if in liquid form), granting advantage on attack rolls, resistance to all types of damage, and a 20 foot increase to speed for a number of rounds equal to the creature's proficiency bonus.

After its effects cease, the imbiber makes a Constitution saving throw (DC $15+1$ per dose of proelio in the last week) or gains a level of exhaustion for each dose of proelio taken in the last day. This exhaustion remains until the imbiber takes more proelio or makes another saving throw 24 hours later.

## WEAPONS

Garrote. If you would have advantage on an attack roll against a target and use this weapon to grapple instead, you can loop the garrote around your foe to have advantage on a Strength (Athletics) check to grapple.
Locking Garrote. A common weapon used by assassins, this garrote's thin, metal wire runs between a pair of steel handles that each contain half of a locking mechanism. A locking garrote works as a garrote with the following changes. When used against a creature with the restrained condition, the wielder can spend an action to lock the the garrote handles together, freeing their hands while leaving the target suffocating. Unlocking a locked garrote requires the target to spend an action making a DC 15 Dexterity (thieves' tools) check, a DC 20 Strength check, or to use a key designed for it. A locked garrote has an AC of 18 and 20 hit points.
Sword Cane. This polished wooden walking stick has a blade hidden within it and may be used as either a club or a rapier. Drawing the blade from within the sword cane or sheathing it is a bonus action. The wielder has advantage on checks made to conceal the dangerous nature of their sword cane.

Grenades. This small, cylindrical explosive can be thrown at a target within 60 feet as an action. Any creature within the grenade's area of effect ( 20 feet) makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or takes the grenade's damage (a successful save halves this damage). Bang, bio, flash, gas, lethal gas, and tear gas grenades do not require Dexterity saving throws.
Bang. Creatures that fail a DC 15 Constitution saving throw gain the stunned condition until the start of the wielder's next turn and gain the deafened condition for 1d4 rounds.
Bio. Creatures that fail a DC 15 Constitution saving throw gain the poisoned condition until they take a short rest or receive healing in excess of 5 hit points.
Concussion. Deals 4d6 bludgeoning damage.
Cryo. Deals 4d6 cold damage.
Flash. Creatures that fail a DC 15 Constitution saving throw gain the blinded condition for 1d4 rounds.
Frag. Deals 4d6 piercing damage.
Gas Grenade. A nonmagical effect identical to fog cloud, except that the fog dissipates after 2d4+4 rounds.
Lethal Gas Grenade. A nonmagical effect identical to cloud kill, except that the fog dissipates after 1d4+2 rounds.
Lightning. Deals 4d6 lightning damage.
Plasma. Deals 6d6 fire and lightning damage.
Scorcher. Deals 4d6 fire damage.
Slasher. Deals 4d6 slashing damage.
Tear Gas Grenade. A nonmagical effect identical to stinking cloud, except that the gas Table: Weapons

# EVIL RELIGS 

Scattered throughout Askis are relics of enormous power and sin. Any person can wield these items be they pious or wicked, but only those with souls beyond redemption can unlock such an object's full potential.

## Drinkable Tentacles

## Potion, rarity varies

The creations left by mad scientists as they scurry in the Taenarius Tunnels are varied and wicked, but none are as infamous as drinkable tentacles. No one is sure which insane inventor in the underground labyrinth created the first batch of liquid that allows a humanoid to grow slender boneless limbs from their back or cause writhing tentacles to erupt from the ground, only that the first concoction to do so came from the passages beneath Gratia. It first appeared in that city and was popular among its criminals for a time, but possession of the stuff is now illegal by penalty of permanent residency in the Samovi Preserve.

The four types of drinkable tentacles potions are identified by their color as shown on Table: Drinkable Tentacles. The color describes both the hue of the potion (which has a tiny mass of wriggling limbs suspended in the liquid) and the tentacles formed by drinking or smashing it.

As an action you can drink the potion, or smash it at a point 60 feet away on the ground.

If you have a Sin score, the duration of the effects from drinkable tentacles increase by a number of rounds equal to your Sin modifier.

Drink. After drinking this potion, you immediately grow tentacles from your back that remain for 1 minute. As an action, you can attack with each tentacle as a weapon with which you are proficient. Each tentacle deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage plus additional damage equal to your Sin modifier (minimum 0), and have both the finesse and reach properties. Instead of dealing damage with a tentacle, you may grapple the target of your attack. Each tentacle can grab 1 creature. In addition, you gain advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks made to climb or grapple with the tentacles.

Red and purple tentacles shoot energy projectiles that deal 1d6 force damage (range 20/60).
Smash. After smashing this potion on the ground, a 20 -foot-square mass of wriggling tentacles (of the same color as the potion) appears on the ground for 1 minute (as if you had cast the black tentacles spell and it required no concentration or components).

The area becomes difficult terrain and when a creature enters the affected area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 3d6 bludgeoning damage and be restrained by the tentacles until the effect ends. A creature that starts its turn in the area and is already restrained by the tentacles takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage. Red and purple tentacles cover a 40 -foot-square area. Blue and purple tentacles deal 4d6 bludgeoning damage plus an additional amount of damage equal to your Sin modifier.

A creature restrained by the tentacles can use its action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (its choice) against the spell save DC, freeing itself on a success.

Table: Drinkable Tentacles

| Color | Rarity | Number of <br> Tentacles | Ranged | Spell Save DC | Spell Modification |
| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :-- |
| Blue | Uncommon | 2 | No | 15 | None |
| Red | Rare | 2 | Yes | 16 | Larger area |
| Green | Very rare | 4 | No | 17 | More damage |
| Purple | Legendary | 4 | Yes | 18 | Large area, more damage |

# Fiendish Crowbar 

Weapon (club), rare (requires attunement)
There are no definitive origins for the fiendish crowbar but most believe they are the weapons of abrikandilu thrown up from out of the Abyss to wreck havoc. Generals of the forces of evil gave these potent weapons as gifts to their lieutenants during the Twilight of Suffering and were widely used in conjunction with assault teams to breach fortresses, break into the bedrooms of sleeping monarchs, and bludgeon their enemies to death. Upon discovery these items are not preserved, the memories of dwarven bastions pried into and elven sanctuaries smashed to ruin still fresh in cultural memorythey are resilient however and even when it seems that one of the weapons has been destroyed, it has instead discorporated and reappeared in a new, random location somewhere else in Askis.

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon (if wielded in two hands this bonus increases to +3 ). When you make a critical hit with this weapon while wielding it with two hands, you deal an additional amount of damage equal to your Strength modifier +3 . You deal double damage to objects and structures when damaging them with this weapon. If you have an evil alignment you may treat this weapon as though it were a mace instead of a club.

Destructive Urge. Whenever you are conscious at the end of a combat and have this weapon on your person, you must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure you are compelled to use it and break something nearby.

Satanic Prying. You can use this weapon in place of a set of thieves' tools when opening locks or disarming traps by making a Strength (thieves' tools) check. You are treated as though you have proficiency with thieves' tools on this check. Once per 24 hours, this weapon can dispel an arcane lock (no check required).

If your Sin score is 15 or higher, when wielding this weapon with two

hands you can
treat it as though
it were a greatclub.

## Pin of Withering Loyalty

Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
Centuries ago when the industrious town of Moene was on the rise the entrepreneurial gnome enchanter Barzen Boggle couldn't get anyone to invest in his business. Though he begged and pitched for decades, all thought his schemes too risky. During this time he created the pin of withering loyalty, an enchanted trinket that gave him direct control over those who snubbed him before. So what if the side effect suffered by his deriders was death? As Barzen's business boomed his secret became known far and wide-rather than face the Justitia or rehabilitation with The Ministry, he took all his pins and fled into the Taenarius Tunnels where it's said that he left many of the relics in an abandoned lab somewhere beneath Moene.

After you attune to the pin of withering loyalty, you can use an action to make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to affix it to a humanoid creature's exposed skin. The DC for this check is the target's Armor Class. If you exceed this check by 5 or more, you stick the relic on the target without it noticing. Once affixed to a target, the pin of withering loyalty stays on the surface of that creature's skin for 1 d 4 rounds. During this time any creature that can reach the target can remove the pin as an action. After this time, if it is still affixed the pin of withering loyalty burrows into the target's body.

While the pin of withering loyalty is inside the target and you are attuned to the pin, the target is charmed by you for as long as the pin remains inside it. While the target is charmed, you have a a telepathic link with it as long as the two of you you are on the same plane of existence. You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as attack that creature, run over there, or fetch that object. If the creature completes the order and doesn't receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.

---

You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn't do anything that you don't allow it to do. During this time you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses. In addition, you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well.

A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check made over 1 minute finds the pin, but to remove it from the target requires surgery (see chirurgical procedures on pages 84-92).

Every 24 hours the target wears the pin of withering loyalty, its hit point maximum is reduced by 1 d 4 . The target cannot regain these hit points in anyway until the relic is removed. Once the pin of withering loyalty is removed, a lesser restoration spell or similar magic restores the target's hit point maximum. If the target's hit point maximum is reduced to 0 as a result of carrying the pin, the target dies.

If the target dies, the pin of withering loyalty emerges from its body and falls to the ground within 5 feet of its corpse.

Special Attunement. A creature cannot attune to the pin of withering loyalty while the relic is inside of its body. In addition, a creature that attunes to the pin of withering loyalty remains attuned even if it is more than 100 feet away from the relic for 24 hours or longer.

If your Sin score is 14 or higher, you can attune to this item, plus three others.

## Purpura Dirk

Weapon (dagger), very rare (requires attunement) Purpura dirks recently appeared in Peribolus after a group of criminals escaped the Samovi Preserve and made it into the city. They were captured after several weeks, though many citizens who crossed paths with the escapees were stabbed or poisoned to death. Each escaped criminal carried a purpura dirk, a long sharp amethyst made from a dark ritual using the petrified organs of a purpura.

What the authorities do not know is that purpura dirks are being created by Dalvora Yalyz, a half-dragon lich that holds considerable influence in the Samovi Preserve. She harvests the purpura to create all manner of weapons with one goal: arming and leading a revolution that allows her to escape the floating island prison.

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls with the purpura dirk. While you are attuned to the dagger, you gain immunity to poison damage and the poisoned condition.

As an action, you can cause the purpura dirk to produce a single dose of any poison you have ever seen used (pages 131-136). If the poison is an injury poison, it appears on the blade. If it is another type of poison, you must have an appropriate receptacle to store the poison or it is wasted. Once the dagger generates a dose of poison, it cannot do so again for another 24 hours.

If your Sin score is 14 or higher, the purpura dirk can create three doses of poison before it cannot do so for another 24 hours.

# Saber of the Succubus 

Weapon (scimitar), legendary (requires attunement) Lexallia the succubus lived for years hidden among the people of Noticia, using her charms to stay one step ahead of authorities and living in disguise as the younger wife of Samson Grandwit, a retired human adventurer and legendary eldritch knight. The agents of The Inquisition are powerful however, and the fiend's ruse could only last for so long-after decades of avoiding them, the church came knocking for her. As soldiers threatened to bang down the old adventurer's door Lexallia begged Samson to hide her somewhere, anywhere. The old man, his mind addled from years of the fiend's magic, took his scimitar and stabbed his bride with it to absorb her essence into the weapon. Shortly thereafter the old adventurer died as The Inquisition burst in and his blade, transformed into shifting vile metals, proved nearly impossible to destroy. Worried that its influence (radiating evil and filled with the soul of a fiend) would spread to any guards defending it, the sword was cast into the Samovi Preserve. Many believe it is still within the borders of the floating prison but others know the true story.

The sword was taken as a prize by Markeel Danforth, an elven ranger who dared to enter the Samovi Preserve as sport. Ultimately he left the malicious island but none know where he went next. Markeel still has the blade and rumors claim that the sword of the succubus has hold of him-he stalks the world, hunting members of The Inquisition to feed the weapon's bloodlust only to slip away to the next city before he can be caught.

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls with the saber of the succubus. In addition, while you are attuned to the sword you can cast the alter self and charm person spells at will (spell save DC 15).

If your Sin score is 10 or higher, the first time you hit a target with the saber of the succubus on your turn, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature gains one level of exhaustion and you gain 10 temporary hit points.

If your Sin score is 13 or higher, the second time you hit a target with the saber of the succubus on your turn, until the start of your next turn you gain the
benefits of the haste spell while your target suffers the effects of the slow spell.

If your Sin score is 16 or higher, you deal an extra 3 d 10 psychic damage on a critical hit with the saber of the succubus.

Dominance. If your Sin score is less than 10 , when you attune to the saber of the succubus you must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or you are charmed by the weapon and feel the need to keep it drawn at all times. As long as you are attuned to the saber of the succubus and your Sin score is less than 10 , you must repeat this saving throw every 24 hours, ending the charmed condition for 24 hours on a success.

Sentience. The sword of the succubus is a sentient neutral evil weapon with an Intelligence of 15 , a Wisdom of 12 , and a Charisma of 20 . It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. The sword can speak, read, and understand Abyssal, Common, and Infernal, and can communicate with its wielder telepathically. Its voice is dark and husky. The weapon constantly asks its wielder to take care of it, promising to care for its wielder in return.

Personality. The saber of the succubus is on a quest for personal vengeance: it wants to kill members of The Inquisition. If a character has a clear opportunity to kill a member of The Inquisition and does not take it, conflict arises. The weapon is paranoid and fears abandonmentwhile it speaks in a seductive tone, it is very worried about being discarded by its wielder, traded away, or otherwise falling into obscurity. If the wielder does not speak to the saber of the succubus for 24 hours, a conflict between the weapon and wielder occurs the next day at sunset.

## Sign of Izbek

Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement) As the Celestial Heroes shaped the world of Askis, beings from other planes of the multiverse watched, wondering if Tucker Quickfoot and his demigods would eventually venture forth to try to shape their worlds. The great balor Izbek feared that the unyielding order and good brought to Askis would soon come to demons and decided to strike first, pouring a piece of his evil soul's essence and malice into an emerald-studded cross he hurled into the settlement of Eludere. There it was picked up off

---

the streets by Karmara the Maimed, a half-orc beggar. Karmara used the stone to rob and became wealthy, though it also pushed her to commit acts of chaos in the streets. The half-orc was captured before too long but the sign of Izbek was nowhere to be found. A decade later another beggar named Readil Halfhand found the cross and used its power to murder Eludere's wealthiest citizens, only to be killed while attempting to take another life, and yet again the item disappeared. The same happened with Blind Halgus, Vile Tomi, and Bergan Dirtbeard-every few years the cross somehow finds its way into the hands of Hill Town's poor, stirs up violence, and then disappears.

While the sign of Izbek is attuned to you, you gain the following benefits.

Consult with Izbek. As an action, you can ask the balor (a being with knowledge of magic and the planes) a 25 -word question spoken aloud. You get an immediate, telepathic response from Izbek that can be any length and is determined by the GM. Once you use the sign of Izbek to communicate with the fiend, it cannot be used to speak to him again until midnight.

Inflict Madness. As an action, you can force one creature you can see to make a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or gain a random short-term madness (page 141). If the creature is already afflicted with short-term madness, it instead gains a random long-term madness (page 142). If the creature is afflicted with both short-term and longterm madness, it gains a random indefinite madness (page 143). Once the sign of Izbek has been used in this way three times, it cannot be used this way again until midnight.

Spells. You can cast the following spells from the sign of Izbek, requiring no material components (spell save DC 19): cone of cold, fire storm, fireball, lightning bolt, wall of fire, and wall of ice. Once you cast a spell with the sign of Izbek, it cannot be cast again from the relic until midnight.

Summon Izbek. If you have a Sin score of 14 or higher, as an action you can summon Izbek (a Balor) into an unoccupied space you can see within 120 feet. You have no control over Izbek, but he is friendly to you and your allies when first summoned. Izbek delights in creating violence and chaos-and chooses when to return home. Once the sign of Izbek is used to summon Izbek, it cannot be used to do so again for 1 month.

## Staff of Death's Commander

Staff, legendary (requires attunement)
Centuries ago the tiefling necromancer
Xalzaia Cardime conjured an undead army to conquer Prensatio once and for all, seeking to add the multitude of dwarves dwelling there to her forces-alive or otherwise. Though her assault failed the fiendkin murdered scores before axe and lead shot saw her dragged down in the street. Following their master's direction her apprentices stole her head, affixed it atop the necromancer's oak staff with the tongue of a ghoul, and threw the item into a mass grave outside the city that contained Xalzaia's minions. The necrotic energy in the pit seeped into the staff and skull, grafting them together with terrible magic to create the staff of death's commander.

Empower Undead. As an action, you can emit a burst of dark energy from the staff of death's commander that empowers undead creatures you choose and can see within 30 feet of you. Those creatures immediately gain 3 d 10 temporary hit points and whenever they make an attack roll or saving throw, they can roll 1d4 and add the number rolled to the attack roll or saving throw. These benefits last for 1 minute. Once you have used this feature, you cannot do so again until midnight.

Gboul Tongue. You can attack with the tongue on the staff of death's commander as if it were +1 vobip. When you hit a creature other than an elf or undead with the tongue, it must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Soul Trap. If you have a Sin score of 14 or higher and are holding the staff of death's commander, you can spend an action to target one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must make a DC 17 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target's soul is magically trapped inside the relic. While the soul is trapped, the target's body and all the equipment it is carrying cease to exist. On a successful save, the target takes 7 d 6 necrotic damage,

---

and if this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, its soul is trapped as if it failed the saving throw. The staff of death's commander can hold one trapped soul at a time. While you carry the relic and a soul is trapped within it, you gain resistance to necrotic and poison damage.

If you have a Sin score of 16 or higher and are holding the staff of death's commander, you can release or destroy a soul held within the relic as an action. If you release the soul, the creature and its equipment appear in an unoccupied space of your choosing that you can see within 30 feet. If you destroy the soul, you unleash a 30 -foot cone of negative energy. Creatures that are not undead in the area must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 8 d 10 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. If the staff of death's commander is destroyed while a creature's soul is inside it, the creature and its equipment appear in an unoccupied space nearest to where the relic was broken.

Once the staff of death's commander has been used to attempt to trap a soul, it cannot be used to do so again until midnight.

Spells. You can cast the animate dead and create undead spells from the staff of death's commander once each without expending any material components. The relic regains the ability to cast these spells each day at midnight.

Sentience. The staff of death's commander is a sentient chaotic evil staff with an Intelligence of 19, a Wisdom of 14, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.

The staff of death's commander can speak, read, and understand Abyssal, Common, Deep Speech, Infernal, Undercommon, and Vilespeech, and can communicate with its wielder telepathically. The relic's voice is raspy and it laughs at the misfortune of others, including the wielder.

Personality. The staff of death's commander is most concerned with gaining necromantic knowledge and keeping those secrets between itself and its wielder. It also seeks to kill former wielders who share its knowledge of dark magic. Conflict
arises if the wielder passes up a chance to gain a new tidbit of necromancy or fails to murder one of the relic's former wielders.

The staff of death's commander enjoys cruel jokes, the pain of others, and gazing upon the beauty of undead creatures. It constantly demands its wielder use it to make more soldiers. If the wielder goes more than 10 days without making any undead, a conflict between the staff of death's commander and wielder occurs the next day at sunset.

## Staff of Vile Conjuring

Weapon (staff), legendary (requires attunement by an evil bard, diabolist, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)
The conjurer Stephni Hibernica did not go down without a fight or a plan to exact revenge, though she did not expect her weapon to embody her vengeance. Society spurned her genius and the bookish girl took to forbidden tomes, learning that her talent for persuasion included fiends as well as the fools around her. For over a decade she terrorized the settlements of Samovi with attacks by unholy creatures she commanded by will alone-until the Justitia finally had her in their proverbial crosshairs. It was as Stephni finished work on her greatest creation that they finally struck and in the chaos, she carved the last rune incorrectly and was dragged into the Staff of Vile Conjuring both body and soul. It has been over a century since her corporeal body died in a rehabilitation facility but the true power of the diabolist lurks still, laying in wait within her staff in Adversus' Museum of Artifacts and Antiquities.

This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While you hold it, you gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls. This staff has 10 charges and regains 1d6+4 expended charges daily at midnight. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff summons 1 d 4 demons and devils (of a total CR no greater than 10) and Stephni Hibernica (NE human diabolist 17) with direct control over them, the staff crumbling into black and jade ash.

---

# 11 

Spells. While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it: conjure demon ( 7 charges) or conjure devil ( 7 charges). If you are a diabolist, you may treat charges in the staff as conjuring points. If you have a Sin score of 17 or higher, you can cast these spells using only 5 charges each.

Unholy Potency. While holding the staff, you can expend 1 charge to ignore the effects of one of the Bands of Kyttarmoak for 1 round.

File Cloud. While holding the staff, you can use an action and expend 3 charges to cause a miasma of evil to spread out in a 30 -foot radius from you. The vile cloud remains for 1 d 4 rounds, making the area heavily obscured for non-evil creatures. Any spells or features used to restore the hit points of a good creature in the vile cloud only restore half as many hit points (minimum 1 hit point), the other half targeting the nearest evil creature in the vile cloud instead (minimum 0 hit points). The vile cloud moves with you, remaining centered on you. A wind of at least 10 miles per hour disperses the vile cloud and ends the effect.

## Sun-Blotting Sapphire

Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement) More than a millennium ago the dwarven cleric Malador Exiel fell to worship darkness, stealing a clutch of eggs from the gold dragon Verganzax to blaspheme for potent power in return. Using an evil ritual the stout priest shrunk the eggs and turned them into sapphires with the power to absorb light, create darkness, and unleash terrible destruction upon the world. He used these gems to clear the area for his personal fortress, Exiel Keep, but the great serpent tracked him down and destroyed the castle in her rage along with the crags around it. Some say the lower levels of Exiel Keep remain intact, hidden beneath the rubble that makes up Banheidd's Pass in the western ranges of the Rostratus Mountains where the sun-blotting sapphires wait, but the prevailing rumors suggest that the relics were taken long ago and scattered across Askis.

Absorb Light. As an action, you can hold the sun-blotting sapphire aloft and it absorbs the light of any bright or dim light source you can see within 60 feet. If the light source is created by a spell, the magic that creates the light is dispelled. If the light
source is a fire, the fire is snuffed out. For each light source it absorbs, the relic gains 1 charge (to a maximum of 10 charges). If you have a Sin score of 14 or higher, the sun-blotting sphere can gain a maximum of 15 charges. When the relic absorbs its maximum number of charges, it cannot absorb any more light. While the sun-blotting sapphire can absorb light, it does not nullify any other effects of a magic item, spell, or effect that sheds light (such as a paladin's holy nimbus feature).

Armor of Shadows. If you have a Sin score of 14 or higher, as an action you command the sun-blotting sapphire to cover you in shadowformed armor that lasts 1 minute. While you wear this armor, you are invisible in dim light, you gain 20 temporary hit points, and any creature that hits you with an attack must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of its next turn. Once you use sun-blotting sapphire to conjure armor, you can't do so again until midnight.

Create Darkness. As an action, you can use the sun-blotting sapphire to create an area of impenetrable darkness, as if you had cast the darkness spell. You are able to see through this darkness. Once the relic has been used to create darkness three times, it cannot to do so again until midnight.

Unleash Energy. As an action, you can release all of the sun-blotting sapphire's charges in a 30 -foot-radius sphere centered on you. Each creature in the sphere except for you must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. Creatures who fail take 1 d 8 radiant damage per charge released and are blinded for 1 minute. Creatures who succeed take only half damage. Once you release the relic's charges in this way, it cannot gain more charges by absorbing light until midnight.

Twisted Worldview Eye
Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)
The high elven philosophy professor of the Sancti Afflatu College in Suppetia, Dean Mantocles Ustinar, created the twisted worldview eye to win debates with his fellow lecturers. The relic was crafted from the petrified brain of an elder aboleth stolen from the university's museum; Mantocles did not realize that the full power of the aboleth still lived within the gem, and in his ignorance it took hold of his darkest desires. He used the twisted worldview eye to manipulate and charm others in order to rise through the ranks of the school. Once he was named dean the elf turned to taking over the government but in Mantocles's lust for power, caution was thrown to the wind-after being exposed but before he could be captured, he fled to the Taenarius Tunnels, leaving the relic behind. It has since been returned and is back on display in the college's museum, this time under heavy guard.

Random Properties. The twisted worldview eye has the following random properties:

- 2 minor beneficial properties
- 1 major beneficial property
- 2 minor detrimental properties
- 1 major detrimental property

Argument Winner. When a creature verbally disagrees with something you have said, you can use your reaction to force it to make a DC 17 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save the creature is charmed by you for 1 hour. At the end of that hour, it does not know you charmed it with the relic. The charmed condition ends early if you or an ally attacks the creature.

Natural Charmer. While you are attuned to the twisted worldview eye, you have advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks.

Spells. The twisted worldview eye has 20 charges. While holding the relic, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it (spell save DC 17):
charm person (1 charge), detect thoughts (2 charges), dominate person ( 5 charges), bold monster (5 charges), or suggestion (2 charges).

The twisted worldview eye regains $1 \mathrm{~d} 8+4$ expended charges each day at midnight. If your Sin score is 14 or higher, the relic regains all of its charges each day at midnight.

Twist Worldview. As an action, you choose one creature you can see within 120 feet of you. That creature must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or for the next 1 minute, it sees its enemies as allies and its allies as enemies. Each time the creature takes damage it can repeat this saving throwing, ending the effect on a success. A creature that saves against this effect is immune to it for the next 24 hours.

Destroying the Relic. The only way to destroy the twisted worldview eye is through an 8 hour ritual that requires the sacrifice of 100 purpura. The University of Sanctus Menaechmus (formerly the Sancti Afflatu College) is aware of this ritual but does not have the funds for a delve into the Samovi Preserve to obtain so many of the purple celestials, nor do they have the amoral compass that would allow them to kill five score of the innocent creatures.

# Vengeance's Release 

Weapon (greataxe), legendary (requires attunement)
As a soldier of The Inquisition and devoted paladin, Calladon Rebeaux wielded a legendary axe that laid hundreds of evildoers to rest in the violence before the Utopian Dawn. Despite having performed his duty perfectly, fate dealt the holy warrior a cruel hand as he approached retirement in Adversus-his beloved wife Mira was mistaken for a wanted sorceress by his comrade Aledore Kendall. Unable to defend herself she quickly fell to Aledore's blade and though his tragic mistake was deeply regrettable, the Justitia and The Ministry did not punish him. Instead of rendering pennance its local leaders told the enraged Calladon that this was simply a casualty of war, a tragedy to be forgiven and forgotten.

Calladon could not let his wife's murder go unanswered. Through an unholy ritual he poured his lust for vengeance and his hate for The Ministry into his notched greataxe, then slayed Aledore and as many members of The Ministry as he could before being killed himself. In the end the death toll was fifty-four, the same number of notches within the double blades of Calladon's weapon-which is still on display in Adversus' Museum of Artifacts and Antiquities.

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls with vengeance's release. In addition, when a creature deals damage to you, you have advantage on attack rolls against it until the end of your next turn.

If you die while attuned to vengeance's release, you return as a revenant to seek vengeance on the creature that killed you. The GM may decide to control the revenant as an NPC.

Healing Vengeance. If you have a Sin score of 14 or higher, each time you kill a creature that dealt damage to you in the last 24 hours with vengeance's release, you regain 10 hit points.

Sentience. Vengeance's release is a sentient neutral evil weapon with an Intelligence of 10, a Wisdom of 14, and a Charisma of 17. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.

The greataxe can speak, read, and understand Common and can communicate with its wielder telepathically. Its voice is dark and commanding, and it speaks of vengeance as a righteous cause.

Personality. Vengeance's release hungers to slay those who hurt the wielder in anyway. From the merchant who charged a bit too much for those rations to the trolls that kill the wielder's mother, anyone who caused the person holding the greataxe to experience pain must die. Conflict arises if the wielder does not kill a creature that wrongs it in some way.

Vengeance's release takes itself seriously and does not enjoy frivolity or tasks that distract it from its mission of meting out vengeance. If the wielder goes more than 10 days without killing any creature with the greataxe, a conflict between the weapon and wielder occurs the next day at sunset.

Regarding the Clockwork of Capillaries - Collected 6 Annotated Notes on Engines of Sinew, Bone, and Nerve Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)
This odd medical treatise explores the raw, rude mechanics of the humanoid body from a purely hypothetical, inhumanly emotionless perspective and includes a multitude of truly shocking diagrams, illustrations and charts. Individual chapters are accumulated from a variety of banned and heretical works on vivisection, extreme pain-tolerance and amputation studies, the limitations of physical recovery from shock-trauma and exploratory, invasive experiments on extended families for purposes of "codifying the pure template of man." Several variations of the book exist with each editor revising it and adding their own awful annotations, sometimes redacting the more restrained experiments of their predecessors in favor of their own more ambitious (and more horrific) chirurgical blasphemies.

Appearance. Bound in worn yet pliable and moisture-resistant hide, these rare tomes are typically blood-spattered as their owners often consult with the grimoires at close proximity to the subjects and objects of their experiments. The pages are bound with gut and glue, interspersed with numerous tabs and colored marking ribbons. In addition to bound parchment the book is stuffed with unnumbered, ring-mounted loose-leaf pages, scrawled marginal notes, and step-by-step instructional diagrams with tiny preserved tissue samples mounted on packets or slides. The whole volume is copiously spattered with blood, unidentifiable visceral fluids, and alchemical reagents.

Reading. The reader of this tome develops an all-consuming obsession with blood, vital organs, and observing anatomical bodies flayed open. Whenever a living creature adjacent to the reader suffers a critical hit from a weapon that deals piercing or slashing damage, the reader becomes stunned for 1 round (DC 16 Wisdom saving throw negates) as they observe the flow of blood. Consuming too much knowledge from this grimoire causes a reader to become deranged; each week a creature reads from the pages of this book, they must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw (DC $5+5$ for every 1 d 4 pages read) or risk developing a multiple personality disorder. On a failure, a cold, calculating, and cruelly clinical Lawful Evil version of the character takes root in the reader's psyche and each time they finish a long rest, there is a cumulative chance the alternate
![img-40.jpeg](assets/Book%20of%20true%20Evil_img-40.jpeg)
personality is in control until the next long rest (roll 1 d 20 after the first day and on a 1 the alternate personality takes control, on the second day of uninterrupted control roll 1 d 20 and on a 1 or 2 the alternate personality takes control, and so on).

Benefits. Once a reader has read 10 or more pages of any edition of this work, they gain a +2 bonus on all ability checks made to use the Medicine skill to treat deadly wounds. If the reader has the book open and available when making a Wisdom (Medicine) check, they gain advantage on the check. The reader also gains a +2 bonus on checks made to produce medicinal alchemical items. If the reader has a Sin score of 13 or higher, they gain a +2 bonus on checks made to perform a chirurgical procedure.

The tome contains the methods for all of the chirurgical procedures described on pages 84-92. In addition, the grimoire contains the formulae for creating a number of constructs (including dissectrinators, flesh golems, and as many other mechanical horrors as the GM deems fit).

Omnia Mutandis
Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)
This text, penned over the course of five generations of the Morrodox family, reflects a simple ethos: All things must change. The book is the compiled record of a family tradition of study and experimentation into the manipulation of bloodlines. Rooted originally in the simple hybridization of plants and husbandry of animals, the early research-driven genetic principles of Nathaniel Morrodox were taken by his son Arnim and especially his grandson Essex into their application to higher life-forms, including humans and their kin. Essex became obsessed with the idea of manipulating the breeding lines to perfect the humanoid races, culling impurities and reinforcing the strongest bloodlines with the greatest potential for advancement and power.

Not content to simply breed the best, he experimented with the use of magical and alchemical reagents to forcibly jumpstart evolutionary (and sometimes Revolutionary) responses latent in the genome. Essex's daughter, Zola, became his rapt disciple, even volunteering her own womb as the creche for Essex's experiments. They carefully selected the most refined male specimens they could find, taking their seed and tainting Zola's developing brood with alchemical solutions, rare metallic suspensions and tinctures from the deep places of the earth, and the star-flung residuum fallen from deep space. Her two eldest offspring, Edgar and Herbert, were both born hideously deformed and survived only a few years each, but in her third child, a girl she named Wyndam, she saw perfection. Beautiful, strong, and brilliant at an early age, Wyndam seemed an early validation of the evolutionary theories of her mother and grandfather.

However, the rigors of experimentation took a terrible toll upon Zola's body and mind, and it was not long before little Wyndam became Essex Morrodox's new favored pupil. Zola became their new Patient Zero, living out a tormented existence as her father and daughter studied their erstwhile kin bit by excruciating bit, leaving Zola partially vivisected yet clinging to a tormented half-life for years on end as they explored the aftereffects their many experiments had worked upon Zola's genetic structure. Essex and Wyndam used these insights to forge an entirely new race of bestial mutates, crafting horrific hybrids to serve them as laborers and soldiers. Wyndam cultivated and cloned her mother's
corrupted and diseased tissues, forever searching for new branching germ lines to weave together her twisted experiments, guided by her grandfather's ever-closer guidance. Together they mastered the science of achieving stable, controllable, and even heritable mutations.

In time, the two of them shared their own genetic material, further perverting the grotesque mockery of family they had already become. However, though Essex thought himself the guiding partner in their affairs both scientific and salacious, Wyndam's foresight and cruelty were more precocious than he had guessed. After taking what she wanted from her grandsire, the clever coquette arranged an "accident" that left him crippled and helpless. Wyndam then smugly saw to it that her grandfather suffered the same fate as her own mother, leaving herself the sole repository of the family's line and wisdom. Aided by her mutate servants she began growing her own replacements, mutated and (to her deviant mind) perfected clone versions of herself, infused with her grandfather's essence. Little did she realize however that her grandfather had not taught her all his secrets; having mastered the arts of cloning before Wyndam was born, Essex had prepared multiple clones of himself, and he had subtly tampered with the formulae in Wyndam's notes, causing her clones to devolve horribly and run amok, while the risen clone of Essex absconded with his captive granddaughter. Wyndam has never been seen since and her final fate is unknown and unrecorded in the book.

What is known is that rampaging mutates and mutants destroyed the family homestead, putting the despicable laboratories that warped them to the torch before scattering to the four winds. Essex Morodox had long since planned to abandon the place for a more secret and secure hidden refuge, having assembled a duplicate laboratory and library there. He did not find Omnia Mutandis amidst the wreckage of the family manse, but having already transcribed the data and theories contained therein he considered the book itself little more than a family heirloom, a workbook and history rather than an essential text. Considering himself to have evolved beyond base sentimentality, he cared little whether it was destroyed or simply lost. In spite of his disinterest, the fact that numerous owners of Omnia Mutandis

---

have gone mad or simply disappeared gives rise to unfounded rumors that the sinister patriarch of the Morodox may yet hunt for his family's legacy. Sooner or later however, the book always appears again in the hands of an academic with more ambition than restraint, and the horrors contained within spill out once more into the world. The following paragraph should be deleted in the compilation, but not in the independent product.

Appearance. Omnia Mutandis is a hefty tome with covers of acid-washed non-reactive alloy, with a spine crafted-as a grotesque joke-from the spine of a mutated humanoid of short stature. Several discs of burnished metal and polished crystal are embossed onto the book's cover, core sections of rare elements whose now spent emanations fueled the mutagenic experiments of the book's creators. Strange tendinous membranes stretch from the spine of the book across its covers and into its pages. When stimulated with heat, electricity, or sonic vibration these tissues can be incited to expand or contract with some precision, allowing it to be held open or propped in a variety of positions, or even suspended from the black tendons as they are deformed into hooks and hoops. The text within is a madcap amalgam of different branches of research, and the script within is no different. The Morrolox handwriting ranges from decorative to simple, with impatient scrawls alongside elegant and refined penwork, clearly the product of multiple authors and with annotations throughout forward and backwards. On nearly every page is a stain of some sort; the most benign might simply be blood, the others too terrible to contemplate.

Reading. Reading Omnia Mutandis is sometimes a bewildering exercise in synergizing the higher functions of alchemical metacalculus interwoven with the connecting strands of magic. In order to learn or copy any of the spells contained within this tome, the reader must succeed on an Intelligence check (DC $8+$ spell level). In addition, each week a creature reads from the pages of this book, they must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw (DC $5+1$ for every previous reading) or develop a form of insanity chosen by the GM.

In addition to the mind-rending effects of studying this tome, the residual alchemical creations developed by the Morodox clan infuse the pages of the Omnia Mutandis. Though present only in trace quantities, continued exposure to the book can lead to mutational complications for the reader. Each day spent studying the book forces the reader to make a Constitution saving throw (DC $5+1$ for every previous reading). On a failure, the reader reduces one randomly determined ability score by 1d4-1 (minimum 1) and the saving throw DC resets to 5 . If the reader ever rolls a natural 1 on this saving throw, they contract a permanent mutation from the mutation spell (page 107). As long as the reader has any form of insanity, they are unwilling to admit that handling the Omnia Mutandis is dangerous, unless they have reduced their ability scores by a total of 4 or more.

Benefits. If the reader spends at least 24 hours studying the book, they gain advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks related to polymorph magic and spells, checks to notice that a creature is a shapechanger (whether it is transformed or not), and checks made using alchemists' supplies.

If the reader has a Sin score of 13 or higher and is able to cast spells, the spell save DC for transmutation spells that they cast increases by 1 .

Feats. Studying the Omnia Mutandis for 24 hours allows the reader to select the Mutagenic Summons, Xenophilia, or Xenophobia feats in the future.

Fleshcraft. Like Regarding the Clockwork of Capillaries - Collected $\mathcal{E}$ Annotated Notes on Engines of Sinew, Bone, and Nerve, the Omnia Mutandis contains the methods for chirurgical procedures, though only those directly related to the working of flesh.

Spells. The Omnia Mutandis contains the following spells: alter self, blightcore meltdown ${ }^{\mathrm{V}}$, enlarge/ reduce, fleshcurdle ${ }^{\mathrm{V}}$, genetic purification ${ }^{\mathrm{V}}$, mass mutation ${ }^{\mathrm{V}}$, mutagenic mist ${ }^{\mathrm{V}}$, mutagenic reversion ${ }^{\mathrm{V}}$, mutant plague ${ }^{\mathrm{V}}$, mutation ${ }^{\mathrm{V}}$, one of us ${ }^{\mathrm{V}}$, polymorph, summon borde of flesh ${ }^{\mathrm{V}}$, summon mutants ${ }^{\mathrm{V}}$, unstable isotope ${ }^{\mathrm{V}}$.

As she steps forward the Sica Rimora shakes her head, her void-edged brauazian blade bleeding an utterly black mist into the darkness of the passage. "Rogar, this entire thing reeks of an ambush. We've been walking for two hours and the further on we get the worse my armor readings are."

The pirate king only chuckles at her caution. "Got your tin can in a fuss, eh? Spectrometiculator is out of tune, returnin'fast vectors?" Rogar idly plays with one of the decrepit fingers banging from his beard, his wide eyes standing out from the darkness and peering ahead of her. "Tell me my guess is right!"

His lieutenant sighs, nodding and sheathing one of her swords-but not both—as the other Sica Rimor behind Rogar responds on her behalf. "As usual your guess is right Captain, but that does not make her incorrect. We've both noticed several sensors on our approach to this supposed meeting place."
"Obbb, is that so?" In the blink of an eye the dwarf's chambered shotgun is in his hands and firing, a spray of lead destroying a crenellated stalactite just above their heads. What falls onto the ground is not made of stone-it crumples and dents as it hits, clockwork pieces spilling out along with sparks and smoke. "Aye I seen 'em too, no fancy helmet required. By my count that's the fourth or so, meanin' we must be close."

Not a moment later they reach a split in the Taenarius Tunnels and the lead Sica Rimora silently motions for her companions to stop; before any of them can call out a robed tiefling steps into view, his hands templed together. "My master," he says, "would prefer it if you refrained from damaging any more of her works." He gracefully turns on heel and begins walking away, the trio of visitors following behind. With every step his posture straightens and with each syllable his voice becomes more metallic, tinged with a hollow echo. "You may proceed without fear, Pirate-King Rogar Fulgrym -time is a commodity that I have in far greater abundance than you. Were there any intention to cause you injury it would have been a simple thing long before your ship sailed near the cove you arrogantly believe has given you a safe, secret harbor."

His lieutenants exchange a knowing look but Rogar merely guffaws, increasing his stride. "Best we get on with it then!" In a few minutes they come upon a flickering green light from around the corner of the passage after the worked stone turns into brick and the pirate king's laughter finally fades, his ears straining to pick up details from the conversation inside of the jade-lit chamber. Within is a dining room from antiquity, two very particular individuals standing at one end of a long banquet table with plans and schematics spread out before them.

The first is taller and thinner than Rogar, her body covered in midnight black armor with engraved spikes and lit in spots by the same unholy green flames illuminating the room-Caskette, the bust of this meeting of minds. Beside her is a man half her size, festooned with clocks and watches but otherwise attired in a finely-tailored suit and top hat. Though not nearly as infamous or well-known as she is, the pirate king deduces that he can be no other than Aevus Fatalibus. Rogar notices the lack of lackeys and beckons for his Sica Rimora to stay back then waltzes forward himself, quickly taking in the designs and nodding absentmindedly to the halfling gentleman.

Aevus winks and tips his hat but Caskette makes no effort whatsoever to address the new arrival, continuing as if he'd been there all along. "Gespadrieux insists that he has a solution for Lellwyn Fethyrwal and though he is treacherous, there is little reason for him to lie at this juncture." She gestures at a bureau against the wall and a wide scroll floats towards her as she continues, her raspy metallic voice echoing from both herself and her retreating servant. "While this is dealt with I suggest we focus on Tapper Underknoll and breaking the Samovi Preserve. Liberating it without destruction will be too costly in resources, and anything or anyone worth recruiting from within will survive the devastation. There will be losses to be certain, but my estimates have determined it is the least costly tactic."

Mumbling affirmations and nodding enthusiastically the halfling grabs the scroll, unfurling it to reveal a large, sparse diagram of the floating island prison. "I agree wholeheartedly—what a sight that'll be! Imagine the chaos! We will accomplish much in the havoc that'll ensue, but we'll need more information than this..."

Caskette finally turns to Rogar, the lenses of her armored eyes seething with unholy jade light. "That brings us to you, pirate king. We understand that you have special knowledge of this place." She points to a fountain pen and it floats in the air in front of the dwarf as she asks him, "what say you?"

Rogar cracks his knuckles and grins, striding forward and grabbing it from the air with a meaty fist.

# EVIL GAMEMASTERING 

Running a successful campaign can be arduous as it is but when the players are the villains there's more for the GM to be mindful of to make sure the game's a success. The fundamental thing to remember is to keep everyone at the table entertained and thrilled to be there-a gruesome and depraved time perhaps, but a worthwhile one all the same.

## Consent

This is a book for groups that are interested in roleplaying evil characters and is not ideal for all tables. The content herein is intended for mature readers and contains material which may cause discomfort. GMs should not surprise players with the nature of what they are going to experienceeveryone at the table should participate in a discussion of consent before play begins, confirming that they are on board to explore the adult-oriented themes in the Book of True Evil. In addition to making sure that no players are ostracized, this also helps set the tone for the game to encourage a more serious approach than what some groups might be accustomed to.

Ambiance is important whenever evil plays a palpable central role that goes beyond simplistic motivations for NPCs and for this reason alone a GM should seek the consent of everyone in a gaming group. Jokes and quips are a frequent part of most games but if the content of a campaign is about candle-lit rituals and gruesome acts, the tone of a session will fall apart quickly due to inappropriate commentary (even if it might be quite humorous).

Consent should also be a concern for GMs as not every player is necessarily prepared for a long, graphic description of someone having their legs slowly torn off by a monstrous demon. What if a player has actually witnessed an industrial accident where someone lost their legs? While that certainly has the capacity to be an extremely memorable and horrifying experience for that player, they (very understandably) may not want to be reminded of the memory. Here are a few bullet points you can list off when seeking the consent of a gaming group before engaging in macabre horror roleplay:

- Decapitation or Disembowelment
- Dismemberment
- Extremely Graphic Violence
- Religious Violence
- Sexual Violence
- Torture

With a baseline for what is or is not acceptable territory for the game to traverse, the GM can craft narratives and plot arcs that explore the darker sides of roleplaying games. These should create ample opportunities for players to be despicable and vile, pushing the boundaries of morality and encouraging them to walk ever darker paths. In situations like this a common problem tends to arise very quickly: teamwork. After all, why should the cutthroat mercenary suffer the prattling of a mage that takes coin that could be hers, and why should a powerhungry dark priest tolerate anyone other than themselves benefiting from his sacrifice? In short, avarice and greed can be just as damning to an evil game as comedy.

## Maim, Mutilation, Murder-It's All Evil To Me

One adventurer's evil may not be another's and after determining the boundaries of the campaign with a discussion of consent the GM should lock down just how villainous the party wants to be. This process should be worked into character creation, ideally during a Session Zero so everyone has ingrained connections to one another prior to bringing the downfall of goodness. To that end there are some suggestions below to give guidelines on how dark the content of the game might get-it's ultimately the GM's job to figure out just the right vile temperature.

Mustache Twirling. This level of evil is the realm of saturday morning cartoons and political satire. If anything in this book is appropriate for the teenager crowd, this is likely where that line gets drawn-and it means that some content (like vile rituals) is probably a little too visceral for the table. GMs should keep to tame descriptions of gore and villainous acts, relying on a more nebulous attitude that lets players populate the environment around them via questions about what they see peppered by the occasional lead to keep things above board. For example, when discovering a room used in a ritual that

---

involved living sacrifices still on site, the players might be asked "do you check the bodies for marks similar to those you found on the note?" and use tattoos rather than something more nefarious and invasive (like body injections, inscriptions on bones that need skinned of their meat to be found, and the like). In general the inherent heresies of the adventurers should only come up when there's a major purpose for them in the game's plot.

Realistic. The world we live in can be an awfully dark place already and the evils of Earth's history might be as dark as the game gets. In that case there shouldn't be too much material to omit from the Book of True Evil aside from the exceptionally diabolical elements (like fleshcloths made of babies or the patron of meat warlock archetype), descriptions of gore can be uncomfortable but on the brief side, and the party's inherent heresies should make infrequent appearances regardless of the campaign's bigger scope.

Grimdark. Tame folks trying out an evil campaign are best suited to start here-the GM should be swimming in the well of wickedness, but the PCs are just taking a few drinks. Everything in this tome can be a part of the campaign without unduly upsetting anyone, there's no bottom for how visceral some descriptions might be, and inherent heresies should play a considerable role in the campaign. Remember however that the GM is probably going to come off as more despicable than the party, and there should be an expectation that this level might slide backwards to be more realistic or to be a catalyst that draws the adventurers into true villainy.

Truly File. This is the reason for the Book of True Evil. There are no fences or leashes in this level of evil roleplaying (unless that's part of your thing? We aren't here to judge you) and the material in this tome should be used liberally. When describing gore the GM should go at length and into nauseating detail whenever possible, and inherent heresies should be inherent to every game session with temptations galore. While this is arguably the most enjoyable option it's also the most delicate to successfully maintain-use the guidelines below to keep a group of horrendously vile reprobates together as the party explores the darkest shadows of the table.

## Circumstances and Pacts

Evil PCs are naturally disposed to being, well, evil, and that doesn't exactly encourage equality and teamwork. While this can be great in the context of a narrative toolset it makes for a difficult experience in a tabletop gaming environment and to address this issue, GMs have a few different tacks that can keep a group of diabolical adventurers from tearing one another's throats out.

Plot. The first and foremost route that a GM should use to unify evil PCs is the narrative one. Intertwined by fate, the adventurers need one another in order to enact a ritual that will empower them all, keep a common foe at bay, or otherwise serve everyone in a manner that attempting alone would be tacitly impossible. There is strength in numbers as well-if the world around the PCs is predicated to unveil their dark deeds, a united front will last much longer than isolated individuals that go against the grain.

Mechanical Benefits. While there can be many reasons for evil PCs to act against one another, the motivation is usually greed. A simple answer is to provide something in exchange for acting like a team player. This might be bonus experience points each session, extra gold, or inspiration rewards, but by providing an incentive to encourage friendlier play the GM can bring party unification back into balance despite the absence of morality.

Tertiary Benefits. No one person can be all things to all people at all times. The powerful necromancer might have a capacity to intimidate but turning the ear of someone in the king's court will be beyond his reach-though a malevolent and deceptive bard will have a much easier time reaching so high profile a target. Both can benefit greatly from a dark warrior able to fend off the champions of justice that seek to stop the influence of evil, and the stealthy arts of an assassin to quell witnesses will aid them all. The strong pull of greed might spur audacious characters to attempt subterfuge against their allies if they think they can get away with it, but GMs should encourage diverse and complementary character roles for PCs and include obstacles in adventures that require a variety of strengths to reinforce the benefits of working together.

Contacts. Another good way to curb group subterfuge is with contacts. These individuals can be used both to encourage the PCs they are connected with to avoid injuring their companions in any way,

---

but also as tokens that can be targeted with hostility in revenge for slights between party members. In addition to that contacts can provide ease of play for other aspects of the game-one PC might know a good fence, another an esoteric collector that sells magic reagents of all kinds, and another could have a positive relationship with the local head of law enforcement.

## Squabbles and NIAS

Even with an entire world predicated against them and numerous reasons to be trustworthy allies, inevitably villains among the adventuring party will take actions against their companions. For these eventualities remember to NIAS-Notice the problem, Isolate the players involved, Ameliorate the issue, and Squash the disagreement. This is a solid ethos to keep handy for any game but particularly so when the group are playing wicked characters predicated to duplicity and double crosses.

For the purposes of NIAS we're identifying players that are involved with an above-table problem as "troublemakers", but this shouldn't be a post to lean on-it's only a term and the GM should remember that these folks aren't necessarily out to do mischief beyond the table just for the hell of it.

Notice the Problem. Most of the time a player that's disgruntled isn't going to be overwhelmingly subtle about their dissatisfaction. The GM has a
![img-42.jpeg](assets/Book%20of%20true%20Evil_img-42.jpeg)
plethora of things keeping them busy during a gaming session so the first thing to do is ask other players if the troublemaker has said or seriously implied that treachery might be incoming. That said, here's a few things to try and pick up on while the group is rolling dice.

- Is the troublemaker unusually detached and bored?
- Are there any players the troublemaker is trying not to engage with regardless of in-game motivations?
- Has the troublemaker's character been hardpressed to get involved in the game recently?
- Is the troublemaker trying to get ahold of items that pose a particular threat to their companions, like an arrow of elf slaying?
- Does the troublemaker often get overshadowed by another player?
- Is the troublemaker always late or leaving the game abruptly?

Isolate the Players Involved. Once a possible troublemaker has been identified the first thing for the GM to do is directly address them while away from the rest of the group. It's especially important at this juncture to be direct, transparent, and understanding; before starting this discussion the GM should do their level best to imagine themselves being in the troublemaker's shoes. Remember that while the characters might be malicious villains, the players are friends (or close enough) and should receive respectful treatment when they feel wronged. Should another member of the group be involved with the troublemaker's dissatisfaction, the GM approaches them next in just the same way-frank, open, and empathetic-to get some perspective on all sides of the underlying issue.

Ameliorate the Issue. After the GM has figured out the root of what might motivate a troublemaker to injure the party, steps should be taken to bring an end to the direct conflict (and the greater threat to group cohesion). When this means being harsh on a member of the party (for instance, taking away that arrow of elf slaying) there should be overcompensation in return (maybe they get two arrows of celestial slaying in return). The most important thing to remember for this step is to take the immediate danger of betrayal out of the mix so that the campaign and game sessions can continue without skipping a beat.

---

Squash the Disagreement. All of the previous steps should easily be doable between sessions or if the danger of traitorous players arises in the middle of a game, inside of a 30 minute quick break (far shorter than introducing one or two more characters and handling the fallout therein). Now the GM has to handle the back end of things and try to permanently mend the rift between the party. In situations like these it's best to have more latitude than normal and not be too shy of placating-better to let the errant adventurers have their way a bit in lieu of the group suffering (and background action on things elsewhere can be quietly ramped up to compensate). Here are a few suggestions on how to bring troublemakers back into the fold together so the party comes out stronger from the experience.

- The troublemakers acquire magic items that are sentient and linked togetherif one is kept away from the other or either destroyed, each loses its powers.
- Introduce a subplot that only the troublemakers initially know about and utilize their talents as it gets incorporated into the campaign, illustrating to them and the party that each has a vital role in their group.
- Run a mini-sidequest for the troublemakers in-between game sessions. This could be as simple as a brief romp into a dungeon or an assault on a small outpost of enemies. The important thing is that it gives them a close shared experience to reference later and that they've been given a little extra attention from the GM (and hopefully won't need more because of it).
- Take a chill and hang out! Share a meal with the troublemakers and just talk shop about gaming generally. Don't even broach the subject that's spurred on this impromptu get-together-try to find common ground between them instead, something that might bridge the gap and get them to be more cooperative with one another in the future.

Felt Reheplaying
It is expected for the PCs to do horrible, despicable things in the name of evil or when giving in to their inherent heresy. We recommend that players share the highlights of how they maim, rape, mutilate, torture, and mistreat other creatures. While fun the first ten times, with repetition, these interactions can drag on display, be thinker of, or in mind themselves, the other.

# VILE AFFLICTIONS 

Weaponizing disease and making use of poisons are villainy's purvey. Specific class archetypes and feats offer more intriguing ways to incorporate these rules into the game, and in addition to those found in the regular Fifth Edition mechanics we've included new diseases and poisons here. Note that many of these poisons are extraordinary in their effects and may require saving throws other than Constitution, though the GM may always rule that the normal ability score be used instead.

## Vile Poisons

Any poison listed on the Poisons Table with a ${ }^{\vee}$ is located in this list but otherwise can be found in the core rules. Applying poison to a weapon is an action.

Aethervenom (Injury). Taken from the veins of gargantuan creatures that dwell between worlds, this poison can only be gathered by mages though even then only the courageous dare try. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 14 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is poisoned. The poisoned creature gains the cursed condition (page 143) and must repeat this saving throw every 24 hours. On a successful save, the creature isn't poisoned, and 24 hours later its curse ends.

Arsenic (Ingested). Numerous industrial and medical products utilize this substance in trace amounts but when concentrated it can be quite toxic. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 14 (4d6) poison damage and is poisoned for 24 hours. The poisoned creature is incapacitated. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and isn't poisoned.

Auqeani Grit (Inhaled). Most of the energy in a perverted inaequa device dissipates into the air but some scorches and hardens-when etched away and gathered it can have stranged effects. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is poisoned for 4 d 6 hours. The poisoned creature's alignment registers as evil when interacting with inaequa devices.

Black Lotus Extract (Contact). Only found in remote mountain peaks on Zakuthombo, the rare flower from which this is synthesized is historically highly prized by nobles for its striking beauty. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 28 (8d6) poison damage, is poisoned for 8 hours, its Constitution score is permanently lowered by 4 , and its total hit points are reduced by 2 per hit die. The poisoned creature has disadvantage on Constitution ability checks and saving throws. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, isn't poisoned, its Constitution score is permanently lowered by 2 , and its total hit points are reduced by 1 per hit die. Only a wish or similarly powerful spell can restore the creature's Constitution score.

Blasphemed Saint's Blood (Injury). Taken from a creature made holy by the touch of the Celestial Heroes or a powerful entity from the Upper Planes, this blood has since been thoroughly corrupted by evil. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 21 (6d6) necrotic damage and is poisoned for 1 d 4 minutes. The poisoned creature cannot be healed by divine sources (such as a cure wounds spell cast by a cleric or a paladin's lay on hands feature). On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and isn't poisoned.

Celestial Blood (Contact). The gory remains of a slaughtered celestial can be boiled down and reduced into this lethal concoction, though the smells that emanate from the mixture offend one's very soul. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 16 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is poisoned for 1 minute.

# Vile Diseases 

In addition to the sicknesses in the core rules, the defeated despots of Askis' history and the mad scientists lurking in the Taenarius Tunnels have developed numerous lethal diseases. Most have been eradicated but some still persist in The Ministry's medical laboratories or in parasites clinging to the bodies of monsters stalking the subterranean passages-waiting for new, fresh creatures to plague.

## AETHERVIRUS

Creatures afflicted with aethervirus sometimes choose to leave it untreated, only realizing too late that no mortal can harness the otherworldly symbiote's power. When a creature is damaged by an infected creature's natural attack or a weapon covered by aethervirus, the creature must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become infected. Symptoms manifest after 24 hours after infection, covering one of the infected creature's fore or upper limbs with a roiling black and red pulsating mass.

The infected creature's unarmed strikes gain a +2 magical bonus to attack and damage. Whenever the infected creature wields a melee weapon blood
![img-45.jpeg](assets/Book%20of%20true%20Evil_img-45.jpeg)
gours out to cover the blade with more aethervirus, bonding it to the creature's limb. The bonded weapon deals an
additional 1d4 magical damage and it cannot be disarmed. While a weapon is bonded to the infected creature, it only heals half as much as normal from magical healing. The infected creature can remove a weapon's aethervirus bond by spending a bonus action. When the infected creature completes a long rest, it makes a Constitution saving throw (DC 11 + 1 per previous successful save). On a failed save, the infected creature's Constitution is reduced by 1 . Only a wish or similarly powerful spell can restore the creature's Constitution score. An infected creature with a Constitution score of 0 permanently dies and cannot be brought back to life by any means. On a successful save, the infected creature only restores half as many Hit Dice as they normally would from taking a long rest.

After 3 successful saving throws, the creature recovers from the disease.

## BUBONIC PLAGUE

Whole cities have been evacuated in the wake of this virulence, overrun with vermin carrying it virtually everywhere and quarantined until cleansed of the sickness. When a beast or humanoid creature is bitten by a creature that carries this disease, or when it comes into contact with effluent contaminated by the disease, the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become infected. It takes $1 \mathrm{~d} 4+3$ days for bubonic plague's symptoms to manifest in an infected creature. Symptoms include chills, cramps, fever, malaise, painful swelling, seizures, swollen lymph nodes, and gangrene of the extremities such as toes, fingers, lips and tip of the nose.

The infected creature has disadvantage on Strength and Constitution saving throws, and it regains only half the normal number of hit points from spending Hit Dice and no hit points from finishing a long rest.

At the end of each long rest, an infected creature must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 15 - 1 per successful save). On a failed save, the infected creature's Constitution and Charisma scores are reduced by 2 , and

---

it reduces its hit points by 1 per Hit Dice. On a successful save, the creature does not have disadvantage on Strength saving throws for 24 hours.

After 3 successful saving throws, the creature recovers from the disease. Once recovered, a creature's Constitution and Charisma scores increase by 1 point at the end of each long rest until they are restored to their original values.

## CELERO-LEPROSY

Rumors abound of what causes this sickness but when the afflicted are diagnosed, The Ministry provides a mandatory home for victims to live out the rest of their lives. When a beast or humanoid creature inhales air contaminated by the diseasecarrying bacteria, the creature must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become infected. It takes 1 week for celero-leprosy's symptoms to manifest in an infected creature. Symptoms include patches of light and dark lesions on the skin and minor trouble breathing.

The infected creature gains resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage but vulnerability to poison and disadvantage on saving throws against poison. When the infected creature takes 10 or more damage from a weapon attack (before applying resistance), it loses an appendage such as an ear, finger, or toe. When the infected creature takes 30 or more damage from a weapon attack (before applying resistance), it loses a limb. Body parts can only be restored with the regenerate spell.

Celero-leprosy can be cured using carefully synthesized medicine produced in the most advanced labs of Askis. Given a week, a character with sufficient knowledge and access to a laboratory can turn these reagents into one dose of medicine by making a DC 18 Intelligence (Science) check. Injected into the bloodstream before a long rest, one dose of it prevents the infected creature from suffering the symptoms of celero-leprosy for 24 hours. After 5 doses, the medicine cures the disease entirely.

## COAGULOPATHY

Unlike hemophilia this is not a sickness derived from birth, spread instead by exposure to tainted blood freely flowing from the afflicted. When a living creature is bitten by a creature that carries this disease, or when it comes into contact with blood contaminated by the disease, the creature must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution
saving throw or become infected. It takes 6d4 hours for coagulopathy's symptoms to manifest in an infected creature. Symptoms include heavy external bleeding, blood in urine and stool, severe head or neck pain, repeated vomiting, difficulty walking, convulsions, and seizures.

The infected creature's speed is reduced by 10 feet and whenever it takes 5 or more damage, it immediately starts excessively bleeding, losing 1 hit point at the end of each of its turns during combat or 1 hit point at the end of each minute. This excessive bleeding continues until the infected creature receives magical healing or completes a short rest.

Coagulopathy can be cured using rare reagents taken from 7 plants located in all the corners of Samovi. Given an hour, a character who has proficiency with an herbalism kit can turn these reagents into one dose of medicine. Injected into the bloodstream before a long rest, one dose of it prevents the infected creature from excessive bleeding for 24 hours. After 3 doses, the medicine cures the disease entirely.

## DEMENTIA

One of the greater problems among Askis' swelling centenarian population is the loss of memory, a sickness that even the touch of true divinity cannot totally cure-it does occur among younger citizens, but almost never without some foul catalyst engineered by depraved minds. A creature that has lived $90 \%$ of its race's normal lifespan or has been exposed to a dementia-causing effect makes an Intelligence saving throw (DC $10+1$ per previous save) each $1 \%$ of remaining years or becomes infected.

One week after infection, the creature's memory starts to become unreliable as their mind fragments. The infected creature takes a -1 penalty to ability checks and saving throws that rely on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. At the end of each week after the symptoms appear, the penalty worsens by 1 . When it reaches -12 , the victim is stunned every other round as it constantly reassesses its surroundings. The longer an infected creature has dementia, the more often it must make Intelligence checks to recall information.

Dementia can be cured with a wish spell, though this does not restore memories and only allows the infected creature to keep new ones (removing the disease as well as its penalties to ability checks and saving throws).

---

## KEDRIMEDULLAM

Doctors in The Ministry's research facilities remain unsure of where this sickness spreads from, only that it is commonly found afflicting the malnourished monsters lurking in the Taenarius Tunnels so that it likely began in the depths. When a humanoid creature breathes in air contaminated by kedrimedullam, the creature must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become infected. It takes 24 hours for kedrimedullam's symptoms to manifest in an infected creature. Symptoms include cramps, fever, and excessive swelling of welts and bruises.

The infected creature gains one level of exhaustion, its carrying capacity is halved, it regains only half the normal number of Hit Dice and hit points from finishing a long rest, and it gains vulnerability to bludgeoning damage. At the end of each long rest, an infected creature must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the character gains one level of exhaustion. On a successful save, the character's exhaustion level decreases by one level.

If a successful saving throw reduces the infected creature's level of exhaustion below 1, the creature recovers from the disease.

## MALIGNANT PUSTULES

Found only in the lairs of mad scientists and pools deep in the tunnels nearest the planet's core, even the Justitia dare not meddle with the ooze that latches onto and grows the evil in one's heart. When a creature comes into contact with emanolimus ooze, the creature must succeed on a DC 16 Charisma saving throw or become infected. It takes 1 d 4 hours for malignant pustules' symptoms to manifest in an infected creature. Symptoms include redness around the eyes, bad breath, and pus-filled blisters mottling the skin.

The infected creature's alignment changes to chaotic evil, neutral evil, or lawful evil (whichever is closest). At the end of each long rest, an infected creature must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 16 +1 per previous save). On a failed save it is compelled to commit 1d4 evil acts (worthy of increasing a Sin score; page 6 and pages 127-128). On a successful save, the creature is not compelled.

After 2 successful saving throws, the creature recovers from the disease. Only a wish spell can magically cure an infected creature of malignant pustules.

## MANAWASTING

Certain areas of the Taenarius Tunnels are off-limits to all but the Ministerium Inmorte, the warping magical residue of dubious experiments gone astray transforming those who wander through the forbidden regions into deformed freaks. When a living creature travels through a mana-wasted area, the creature must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or become infected. It takes 1 d 4 days for mana-wasting's symptoms to manifest in an infected creature. Symptoms include unnatural swelling of the skin and strange fleshy growths.

One week after infection, the creature begins to suffer impossible to hide mutations. The infected creature takes a -1 penalty to Charisma ability checks.

At the end of each week after the symptoms appear, the infected creature makes a Strength saving throw (DC $14+1$ per previous failed save) or the penalty worsens by 1 . When it reaches -6 , the infected creature gains the mana-wasted template (page 146). On a successful save, the infected creature's penalty improves by 1 (for example, from -4 to -3 ).

If a successful saving throw improves the infected creature's penalty to 0 , the creature recovers from the disease.

## PHANTASMIA

Anyone diagnosed with this sickness is immediately remanded to The Inquisition-the only known way to be afflicted by it is through the consumption of celestial flesh. When a creature consumes a number of purpura concoctions (page 12) equal to its Hit Dice within a period of 24 hours, the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become infected. Phantasmia's symptoms manifest in an infected creature the next time it takes a long rest.

Whenever the infected creature sleeps, 2 d 4 cobalus materialize within 30 feet. Cobalus resemble the nightmares of the infected creature and use the statistics of Homunculus with the incorporeal movement feature. They are cruel, stealing items and trapping a resting area if left to wreak havoc unopposed-when only one creature is on watch they try to lure the defender away to prepare their devious mischief, forcing companions of the infected creature to take greater security measures. The infected creature is forced awake if all of the cobalus are

---

killed but otherwise they disappear when the infected creature finishes its long rest.

Phantasmia can be cured using the blood of fiendish creatures like daemons, demons, devils, and tieflings. A character who has proficiency with an herbalism kit can turn an ounce fiendish blood into a single dose of medicine after 1 hour of effort. Injected into the bloodstream before a long rest, a dose of it prevents the infected creature from the suffering effects of the disease for the duration of the long rest. After 5 doses, the medicine cures the disease entirely.

## SINOMNIA

The Ministry's rehabilitation centers process scholars stricken by this sickness after improperly reading forbidden tomes that forever change them through the subtle evils of Vilespeech. When a creature reads a particular phrase of Vilespeech or spends more than 8 hours within the presence of at least a dozen books containing Vilespeech within 100 feet of each other, the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become infected. There are no visible symptoms to sinomnia but its effects manifest the next time the infected creature completes a long rest.

When the infected creature finishes a long rest it makes a Wisdom saving throw (DC $15+1$ per previous failed save) or increases its Sin score by 1. After 3 days, every 8 hours that an infected creature does not rest it makes a Constitution saving throw (DC $10+1$ per 8 hours not sleeping) or falls asleep. On a successful save, the infected creature can remain awake for 8 more hours and makes a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or gains a long-term madness. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature gains an indefinite madness instead.

Only a wish can cure a creature of this disease.

## SORDES DIVINA

Wounds from potent evil spells and beasts steeped in vile power can tarnish a soul's connection to the Upper Planes, making it difficult to heal by spell or blessing. When a creature takes more than half of its hit points in necrotic damage from a single source (such as an attack, effect, trap, or spell), the creature must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or become infected. It takes 2 d 4 hours for sordes-divina's symptoms to manifest in an infected creature. Symptoms include lightheadedness and disorientation.

The infected creature only restores half as many hit points as normal from magical healing. At the end of each long rest, an infected creature must make a DC 13 Charisma saving throw.

After 2 successful saving throws, the creature recovers from the disease.

## STOMACH PARASITE

Invisible to the naked eye, travelers know better than to drink from waters deep in the wildernesses of Samovi for fear of ingesting these microscopic organisms. When a creature drinks or otherwise consumes water contaminated by stomach parasites, the creature must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become infected. It takes 1 d 4 days for symptoms of a stomach parasite to manifest in an infected creature. Symptoms include stomach cramps, taut skin, and extreme muscle definition.

Every week, the infected creature doubles the amount of food and water it needs to survive. An infected creature that does not receive enough sustenance regains no healing from short or long rests.

A greater restoration, attack or spell that deals 10 points of force damage per week of infection, or surgery (page 90) can cure the creature of this disease.

## TINEA CRURIS

Wearing one's armor too long and going without washing has its consequences. When a creature has gone a week without bathing or more than 3 days without cleaning a suit of armor they wear each day, the creature must succeed on a DC 8 Constitution saving throw or become infected. It takes 2 d 6 days for tinea cruris' symptoms to manifest in an infected creature. Symptoms include itching and odor in the groin.

The infected creature emits a stench that gives it disadvantage on Charisma ability checks made against creatures within 10 feet. Every week, the infected makes a Constitution saving throw (DC $8+1$ per previous save) or the range of its stench increases by 5 feet (to a maximum of 20 feet).

After 5 successful saving throws the creature recovers from the disease.

# EXPANDED MADNESS 

Exploring dark themes and engaging with horror in the ways presented in this tome means going beyond the scope of the usual rules for madness in Fifth Edition. Below are rules similar to or expanding the existing mechanics, followed by more content for insanity and other themes of terror to make your game as disturbing as it can be.

## Going Mad

Certain spells (such as heresy incarnate and lesser inscribe Vilespeech) can cause insanity as can diseases, poisons, and planar effects. Some artifacts can also break the psyche of a character who uses or becomes attuned to them. Resisting a madness-inducing effect usually requires a Wisdom or Charisma saving throw. Creatures with a Sin score may temporarily suppress madness, though the costs of doing so can be steep (see Dark Madness below).

## DARK MADNESS \& THE CURSED CONDITION

When adventurers are faced with harrowing danger or exposed to true evil even glorious heroes and depraved mages can falter-the following rules are for making the game a genuinely scary experience well beyond the frightened condition!

## Dark Madness

In depravity and the depths of the soul one can sometimes find what seems like clarity or understanding -these are false respites however, often forming into dark underlying truths that return at the most inopportune times.

A creature suffering from a form of madness or the cursed condition (see below) can spend 1 vilis point and increase its Sin ability score by 1 to gain temporary immunity. For forms of madness the immunity lasts for a number of hours equal to the creature's new Sin ability score (if this outlasts the madness the creature is considered cured), and for the cursed condition the immunity lasts for a number of minutes equal to the creature's new Sin ability score.

## Cursed Condition \& Causation Points

This mechanic is a meta tool for the GM to raise the stakes and get the party really feeling the fear intended for the game. What better way to do so than utilize the most hated and feared element of the RPG since its inception: the natural 1.

Creatures gain the cursed condition when in situations of particularly high stress. Here are a few examples of situations that can trigger the cursed condition:

- In combat with less than $1 / 4$ th their total hit points.
- During acts of subterfuge where death or imprisonment may directly result.
- Dangling off a cliff with only a rope and certain death below.

---

- Stranded on a rock in a flow of lava.
- Reaching half of their lung capacity while swimming.

Whenever a creature with the cursed condition rolls with advantage or disadvantage and rolls a natural 1 on either die, the GM gains 1 causation point. The GM can have no more causation points than double the number of adventurers in the party.

Caustion points are used to give NPCs an edge in combat and other situations when it can make the game more exciting. Causation points may be spent in the following ways (usually to benefit NPCs):

- Trigger a flashback for a creature that has used Dark Madness before, causing it to be frightened for anumber of rounds equal to its Sin ability modifier as the ramifications of their deeds shock their psyche (this ignores immunity.)
- Restore a number of hit points to a creature equal to $1 / 2$ its total Hit Dice (as if the creature had taken a short rest).
- Grant a creature the use of Cunning Action (able to Dash, Disengage, or Hide as a bonus action) for 1 round.
- Trigger a conflict between a sentient magic item and its owner.
- Cause a spell to fail (cantrip-2nd-level) or be half as effective (3rd-level-7th-level); for an additional 1 causation point per spell level the GM may select a different target for a spell (cantrips
count as 1st-level spells for this purpose) but causation points can never be used against a spell of the highest spell level a creature can cast.
- Negate a critical hit.
- Grant a creature advantage on an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check.


## A Note On Expanded Fear

The author sof this book think it is potentially cruel and spiteful to suggest this, but we are writing this tome to help you be evil. If you are a truly wicked GM really trying to incite terror, do away with the situational parts of the cursed condition and have it be active at all times (removing the cap to causation points as well). Be warned-this can become a very powerful mechanic and when playing a game using Expanded Fear, the GM should not use its healing or frightened options on a creature more than once per combat encounter.

Inquisitor Octavius tugs on Cassia's robe, taking the Magi Primaria's attentions away from the splendor of Pertinax beneath the tallest of the Dragon Spires and back to the matter at hand. They step back into the tower, the scent of ritual reagents heavy in the air in preparation for her divinations. Rumors of a vile dragon unearthed by a restored passageway in the Operans Mountains overlooking the settlement have raised concerns within The Inquisition, enough of a consternation to merit bringing her in for her expertise with seeing magics. Sitting in the center of complex geometric designs meticulously inscribed onto the floor, Cassia chants the powerful words and sends her consciousness back through the ages, piercing the veil of time to bear witness to the ancient past.

Her mind's eye travels across a maelstrom of shape and color before emerging high above the city, though what she sees below is a sick and twisted parody of the resplendence she just gazed upon. Worse yet it is a bloodbath-she realizes she's been drawn to the final siege of Pertinax and it is just as horrendous as the legends claim. The cries of dying men and monsters fill the air as squads of mercenaries and spellwwords work their way up the settlement, reinforced by legions of soldiers marching in the distance.

Pertinax's foul defenders have slowed the assault to a crawl, fiends and horrid creations pouring out of the mountains. There, a walking sculpture made out of nothing but blood flings pieces of itself into a group of knights and the sanguine chunks furiously explode, dropping two of the warriors. Not far off a mummified form covered in script bursts with green energy that slows soldiers attacking it, and nearby the gaze of an entropy-eyed skeletal lord paralyzes a mage helpless to stop it from ripping out his neck. Demons and devils within her sight are beyond count, small seas of red and orange that cackle and bellow with glee as blood seeps into the streets. Elementals rove the settlement scouring flesh with acid or fire, slamming into warriors and crumpling shields with force or wind, spraying rays of deathly energy that sap sword arms of their strength or soldiers of their lives. Creatures made from furious storms throw lightning that dances from their limbs, forms of golden light heal monsters until their targets explode with radiances of cascading power. It is war at its most savage.

The chaos of the melee throughout Pertinax's streets is unlike anything she has ever seen before but it pales in comparison to the spectacle above the city. Dragons of all kinds wing through the air to breathe lethal elements onto the soldiers below, but other things as well-clouds of otherworldly darkness drive warriors insane or wither muscles with necrotic power while bands of celestial power heal wounds with golden light. The latter shake Cassia from her enrapture of the display of holy and vile dragons in their full majestic might.

Below her the battle is breaking in favor of the invaders, Pertinax's defenders clearly faltering and ready to break as their casualties mount. She is not the only one to observe the flow of combat turn against the forces of evil; one of the corrupted flame-winged serpents wheels away from the fight and into the mountains. Cassia wills the magic to follow the vile dragon inside, weaving through passages in pursuit of the monster as it batters the walls in a clumsy, hasty retreat. The Magi Primaria's sensor accidentally rushes past it and before she can wheel back the vile dragon collapses the wide tunnel with savage strikes of its claws, winging back into the air through a large chamber before buckling the roof of the only other exit in sight.

With a loud groan the creature lands in the center of the cavern, its form shifting into that of a man with a high widow's peak, his black hair tied into a ponytail falling down his back. He is clad in black robes but Cassia quickly deduces that he is bleeding, his left hand red and holding his side as he grabs a potion from off of a table against the wall. After uncorking and drinking several of the vials he stretches, yawning his jaw wide and rolling his neck to a punctuation of cracks far too loud for a person of his size. Without warning his gaze quickly turns upward-be looks directly at Cassia and she suddenly feels his will encroaching into hers, the thing's madness creeping along her magic and across the sea of time, whispering promises of knowledge forbidden, sights unseeable, sounds beyond ears...

Cassia realizes the danger she is in and breaks the spell, shooting up to her feet and backing away from the magic circle. She coughs and sputters as Inquisitor Octavius rushes towards her, crouching low to take her weight on his shoulder. "Did you find anything out? Did the magic take hold?" The Magi Primaria stares back at him and nods, a new bollowness in her gaze.

# MANA-WASTED MUTANT TEMPLATE 

Magic-warping effects sometimes affect the very life force of creatures who wander the regions of the Taenarius Tunnels or come into contact with anomalies arcana. The dangerous effects of magic gone afoul infuse the bodies and essences of these wanderers. Those who spend too much time in these areas occasionally fall prey to the deadly energies that persist in the subterranean passages, and their bodies gradually decay until they are so far removed from their original forms that they can be described only as mutants. Mutants often collaborate in small tribal groups with others similarly affected.

Any living, corporeal creature can become a mana-wasted mutant and keeps its statistics, except as follows.
Alignment. If the mana-wasted mutant had a lawful alignment, its new alignment is non-lawful.
Type. The mana-wasted mutant's type changes to aberration.
Armor Class. The mana-wasted mutant gains a natural armor of 1 (if it already has natural armor, its natural armor increases by 1 instead).
Speed. The mana-wasted mutant loses any magical flight (if the creature uses wings to fly, its fly speed is unaffected).
Ability Scores. The mana-wasted mutant increases its Strength and Constitution scores by 2, and reduces its Charisma score by 2.
Skills. The mana-wasted mutant gains proficiency in Athletics, Intimidation, Stealth, and Survival.
Resistances. The mana-wasted mutant gains resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from
nonmagical weapons not made with cold iron weapons.
Immunities. The mana-wasted mutant gains immunity to poison, diseases, and the poisoned condition.
Deformities. The mana-wasted mutant gains one of the following deformities from its transformation (roll a 1d4 to randomly determine the deformity). Innate Spellcasting. The mana-wasted mutant loses any innate spellcasting it may have had. Any spellcasting features gained from class levels remain unchanged. Mana-Wasted Mutation. The mana-wasted mutant gains a feature related to a mutation on their body.

Mutated Mind. The mana-wasted mutant has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects as well as any saving throws made to resist being charmed or frightened.
Attacks. The mana-wasted mutant's natural weapon attacks are magical. It also gains a natural weapon slam attack that deals damage based on the creature's size (1d4 Small, 1d6 Medium, 1d8 Large, 1d10 Huge).
Challenge Rating. The mana-wasted mutant increases its CR by 1. Recalculate the mana-wasted mutant's proficiency bonus if necessary.
Mana-Wasted Mutations. The mana-wasted mutant gains one of the following features.

- Acid Resistance. The mana-wasted mutant gains resistance to acid damage. If CR 10 or higher, it gains immunity to acid instead.
- Acidic Pustules. Mana-wasted mutants are often covered in necrotic pustules that burst at the slightest touch. Whenever a creature deals piercing or slashing damage to the mana-wasted mutant, all creatures adjacent to the mana-wasted mutant must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC $8+$ the mana-wasted mutant's proficiency bonus + the mana-wasted mutant's Constitution modifier) or take acid damage as its boils and blisters pop and spray (Small 1d3, Medium 1d4, Large 1d6).
- Breath Weapon (Recharge 5-6). The mana-wasted mutant can spray a 30 -foot cone of acidic bile from its mouth as an action. The acid damage caused by this attack is equal to 1 d 4 times the mana-wasted mutant's challenge rating (or level). A successful Dexterity saving throw (DC $8+$ the mana-wasted mutant's proficiency bonus + the mana-wasted mutant's Constitution modifier) halves any damage taken from this attack.

| 1d4 | Deformity | Effect |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| 1 | Deformed Arm | One hand can't wield weapons, but the manawasted mutant's slam attack deals damage as if it were two size categories larger. |
| 2 | Deformed Leg | The mana-wasted mutant's base speed is reduced by 10 feet (minimum base speed of 5 feet), but it gains advantage on checks made to grapple. |
| 3 | Shattered Mind | The mana-wasted mutant has advantage on Wisdom saving throws but reduces its Intelligence score by 2. |
| 4 | Warped Hide | The mana-wasted mutant increases its natural armor by 3 (instead of 1) but does not gain any increase to its Constitution score. |

---

- Diseased. Even though mana-wasted mutants are immune to disease, they can carry a deadly magical contagion that they spread with their slam attacks.

Disease: Mana fever. A creature makes an initial Constitution saving throw (DC $8+$ the mana-wasted mutant's proficiency bonus + the mana-wasted mutant's Constitution modifier) when hit by the manawasted mutant's slam attack and any subsequent saving throws are at that $\mathrm{DC}+3$. At the end of its next long rest, a creature with this disease makes its saving throw or lowers its Constitution score by 1d3 and its Charisma score by 1d3. A creature naturally fights off this disease by making 2 consecutive successful saving throws to resist it.

Any creature that lives with mana fever for a week straight without dying becomes immune to the disease but is transformed into a mana-wasted mutant.

- Increased Speed. The mana-wasted mutants's base speed increases by 10 feet.


# VILESPAWN TEMPLATE 

Eventually the fallen souls that can't struggle back to redemption accrue too much evil, the despicable essence of what they have become rapidly overtaking even their natural biological functions. These cursed creatures become vilespawn, hideously mutated freaks that have changed to appear as they truly are within their blackened hearts.

When any living creature's Sin ability score reaches 23, after taking a long rest it awakens as a vilespawn.
GM Note: Vilespawn are specifically built to remain playable for PCs that have gone off the deep end-just because your evil mage has turned into a (more) freakish monster does not mean things can't get worse! While they may not be able to go about high society with great ease, any adventurer that gains this template should remain a character in the group and the changes to their statistics should alter roleplay (not end it).
Alignment. If the vilespawn somehow had a neutral alignment or was unaligned, its alignment changes to neutral evil.
Type. The vilespawn's type changes to monstrosity.
Intelligence. The vilespawn loses most of its memories and sense of self. Its Intelligence score changes to 7 and it gains proficiency in Intelligence saving throws. If it used Intelligence as a spellcasting attribute, its new spellcasting attribute becomes either Wisdom or Charisma (whichever is higher). If the vilespawn has levels in a class, it loses the feature gained in its most recent level (the next level it takes in this class it regains that feature but not the feature listed for their current level until gaining another level and so on, making it impossible to acquire a 20th level feature).
Resistances. The vilespawn gains resistance to fire and poison damage. If the creature already has resistance to fire and poison damage, it gains immunity instead (as well as immunity to the poisoned condition).
Vulnerabilities. The vilespawn gains vulnerability to radiant damage.
Senses. The vilespawn can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a distance of 120 feet.
Languages. The vilespawn can speak and understand Vilespeech.
Deformed. The vilespawn gains two randomly chosen Deformity feats and has disadvantage on all non-
Intimidation Charisma ability checks. Depending on the circumstances of the vilespawn's transformation, at the GM's discretion other types of feats may result (like Sinful feats or Wicked Grafts).
Challenge Rating. The vilespawn increases its CR by 1 (do not recalculate proficiency bonus).

The statuesque and sublime features of this borned humanoid would be pleasing to look upon but their red-orange skin is cracked and misshapen in places, the scent of brimstone marking them out as something fiendish.

When an incubus (or in more grisly occurrences, a succubus) mates with a creature while in the Abyss their doomed paramour (whether female or male) gives birth to a half-breed: the cambion. These outcasts are hated by both of their kinfolk and live as exiles, whatever semblance of good that might have once been in them snuffed out by the cruelties they suffer for the circumstances of their cursed existence.

## CAMBION (HALF-FIEND) TEMPLATE

A beast, humanoid, giant, or monstrosity can be born a cambion (half-fiend). It keeps its statistics, except as follows.
Challenge. Recalculate the cambion's challenge rating after you apply the template.*
Armor Class. The cambion gains natural armor that increases its AC by 2.
Ability Scores. The cambion increases its Strength and Dexterity scores by 2, and increases its Charisma score increases by 4.
Senses. The cambion gains darkvision with a radius of 60 feet.
Damage Resistances. The cambion gains resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, and poison.
Languages. The cambion speaks Abyssal in addition to any other languages it knows and gains telepathy with a radius of 30 feet.
Innate Spellcasting. The cambion can innately cast charm person (3rd-level), command, and false life each twice per day. The cambion uses Charisma as their spellcasting ability and requires no material components to cast these spells.
Sadistic Strike. The cambion scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 when making a weapon attack.
Claw. The cambion gains a claw natural melee weapon attack that deals 1 d 6 slashing damage.

When playing in a game where the party is of at least 4th level or higher, the GM may allow a new PC to play as a cambion of the same level as the lowest level member of the party -1 .

For example, in a game with PCs of 7th level a new adventurer might be a 6th level cambion. This adventurer is only a half-fiend and has heritage in another race (such as dwarf or even dragonborn) but does not gain ability score increases or features from their other race

This mechanical horror bristles with wires, compartments, and blinking lights up and down its thick stalk-like metallic body, balanced atop six spidery legs and bristling with branching armatures, some with cables and clamps and others tipped with gleaming trocars and pneumatic needlers.

# Dissectrinator

Challenge 5 (1,800 XP)
Medical Installation. Despite its lack of hands, a dissectrinator can use the following equipment: alchemist's supplies, healer's kit, and thieves' tools. It can store up to 50 pounds of such gear in racks and compartments within its body, replacing them when they are exhausted.
Pain Threshold. Any attacks or spells that deal 6 points of damage or less do not deal any damage to the dissectrinator. Restraints. The dissectinator has two sets of restraints which it can use to bind a patient. Once it has grappled a creature, it can make grapple checks (whether to maintain the grapple, pin the creature, or perform other special grapple actions) against that creature as a bonus action.

---

Surgical Assistant. A dissectrinator can use the Help action to assist Wisdom (Medicine) checks as well as ability and tool kit checks as part of a chirurgical procedure.
ACTIONS
Multiattack. The dissectrinator makes two melee attacks or three ranged attacks.
Clamp. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft ., one target. Hit: $7(1 \mathrm{~d} 8+3)$ bludgeoning damage. Instead of dealing damage, the dissectrinator can grapple the target (escape DC 14).
Trocar. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft ., one target. Hit: $16(2 \mathrm{~d} 12+3)$ piercing or slashing damage. Instead of dealing full damage, the dissectrinator can use a syringe dart instead.
Syringe Dart (10). Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, range 40/100 ft., one target. Hit: $10(3 \mathrm{~d} 4+3)$ piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, falling asleep (as the sleep spell) on a failed save, or taking $4(1 \mathrm{~d} 8)$ poison damage on a successful one.
Cortical Puncture. A dissectrinator can use its trocars to drill into the skull of a restrained or unconscious creature and selectively extract portions of the target's brain. It must pierce the target's skull with both trocars (a normal attack) but thereafter can maintain the puncture without needing to attack again as long as the target remains restrained or unconscious. A cortical puncture does not deliver poison but instead reduces the target's Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma by 1 at the end of the dissectrinator's turn each round. A restrained creature makes a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, negating this ability score reduction on a success. The dissectrinator cannot use its darts while performing a cortical puncture. A greater restoration or more powerful healing magic returns a creature's reduced ability scores to their normal values.

A dissectrinator is an example of the light and dark sides of chirurgical practice. In principle it is a semisentient mechanical assistant, programmed and equipped to aid a surgeon in medical matters both simple and complex, whether it be treating poisons or injuries, dealing with disease, or dissection. Of course in the hands of a demented chirurgeon, the cranial dissectrinator becomes a terrifying instrument of torment capable of reducing the bravest of souls to drooling impotence with soulless and heartless clinical precision.

A dissectrinator is 7 feet tall in total, its core body 3 feet tall, atop a set of legs 2 feet long and with a branching set of limbs and sensors making the upper 2 feet. A dissectrinator weighs 500 pounds.

Mad scientists and chirurgeons are nothing if not busy-the demands of their professions leave little time for leisure or distraction, often leading them to leave their diabolical devices unused for long periods of time while important research is conducted or other experiments concluded. There's no reason to leave a useful tool to be useless however and when a dissectrinator critically malfunctions or decays beyond reliability, it is often repurposed into a trap to doom foolish trespassers.

# Clamping Drills 

## Mechanical Trap

When a creature or object comes within 10 feet of sensors hidden in the wall, floor, or ceiling, pairs of mechanical arms ending in clamps shoot out from small, concealed trap-doors. An area might include multiple sensors, each rigged to its own set of mechanical clamping arms. The trap-doors hiding them are seamlessly constructed and cleverly hidden with natural stonework, into works of art, and even seemingly random splotches of gore. The DC to spot them is 18 . With a successful DC 18 Intelligence (Investigation) check, a character can deduce the presence of the sensors or trap doors from variations in the mortar and stone used to create it, compared to the surrounding area. A creature able to carefully cover the sensors from 10 feet away with a flat object, cloth, or wax and a DC 18 Dexterity (thieves' tools) check to move slowly prevents them from detecting creatures.

When the trap activates, each pair of mechanical clamping arms connected to the sensor makes a melee attack with advantage ( +6 bonus to hit) against a random creature within 10 feet of their trap doors (if there are no targets in the area, the mechanical clamping arms don't hit anything.) A target that is hit becomes grappled (escape DC 14, AC 15, 18 hit points). Once one mechanical clamping arm has grappled a creature, the other transforms into a vicious, crude drill clearly meant to do nothing but harm, dealing $22(3 \mathrm{~d} 12+3)$ piercing damage on a successful hit. The mechanical arms continue to attack creatures until 1d4 rounds after the creature ceases to move or they are destroyed.

These are a few of the most common daemons, demons, and devils conjured onto the Material Plane by diabolists (page 18). Daemons exist along the River Styx, serving both chaotic and lawful forces in their pursuit to bring souls to the Abyss where demons dwell or the home of fiends in Hell.

Pale yellow-white hair bats against this fiend's deep red skin, its wings carrying it aloft and its body protected by armor made from the bones of the dead.

On a failed saving throw the target falls unconscious for 1 d 4 rounds, or until they either take damage or someone uses an action to shake or slap the sleeper awake.

## Daemonic Tadpole

## Manual Gun

These foul daemons are farfied in the dogs of the otherworldly standard, first formed when a creature's ethereal manner falls beneath the waves. The bones and mud under the water conged with the wounded soul and knit together over time, immeasurable until a fiendish tadpole emerges wriaghing and struggling to the surface where it consciously seeks out any shred of mortality.

This trap is activated when a trespasser steps within 10 feet of a daemonic tadpole, coming within its limited range of senses and snapped at by the fiendish newborn. The DC 16 spot a daemonic tadpole on the shores of the River Styx is 18. With a successful DC 16 Intelligence (Investigations) attack, a character can see the minute movements of the limited perfectly camouflaged daemonic tadpole against the other ground of the whole world. Who gets on the same leg the attack is on the DC's hit those cheeks are polluted by 3. A daemonic tadpole can be attacked by destroying the creature (AC-13, 3 hp ) or remaining outside of its course.

When the trap activates, the daemonic tadpole makes a make, attack with a sill bonus to hit a creature it has sensed, dealing 1 point of aemon damage. A creature that takes damage from the daemonic tadpole makes a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed saving throw the creature falls unconscious for 1 d 4 rounds, or until it either takes damage or someone uses an action to shake or slap the sleeper awake.

These frog-like fiends swim the River Styx eating up the souls of those that dare to dip their hands into the supernatural waters before their drop into the Abyss or arriving in Hell. Though able to kill by tooth and claw hydrodaemons prefer to render victims unconscious, dragging their sleeping bodies into the icy waters to suffer a truly final death by drowning.

Faces of races long dead swim in the regal red cloak of this black-and-blue skeleton, its armor as fiendish as the diabolically twisting energy vortex in its right eye socket.

Hit: $6(1 \mathrm{~d} 8+2)$ bludgeoning damage plus $5(1 \mathrm{~d} 10)$ necrotic damage.
Paralyzing Gaze. The thanadaemon fixes its gaze on one creature it can see within 10 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or become paralyzed for 1 minute. The paralyzed target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to the thanadaemon's gaze for the next 24 hours.

These potent fiends run ferries across the dark waters of the River Styx, transporting the newly dead to the Abyss or Hell on vessels made from bones stripped clean of flesh by cacodaemons or carved out of the aged wood from the first trees in all of creation. When a conflicted sinner fails to redeem themselves before they die but do not merit an eternity of torment by demons or devils, they are instead made to serve eternal as thanadaemons, the vestiges of their flesh gradually sloughing from their skeletons until only their bones remain. Of all the underworld's natives only thanadaemons are willing to speak to the recently deceased though any that try to best be wary. Attempts to negotiate with these fiends are a dangerous venture-those that have tried and failed are locked away within a thanadaemon's garments, their souls empowering fiendish abilities until utterly expended.

This enormous fiend reeks of sulfur and brimstone, its furry lower body, arms, and torso rank with the iron smell of damp blood. An impressive flare of blue fur makes a mane around the monster's grotesque horned, crimson head and furious avian glare.

Hatred of Mirrors. When adjacent to a mirror or creature wielding a polished metal shield, the abrikandilu makes a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw at the start of its turn or focuses on destroying the object casting its reflection.
Innate Spellcasting. The abrikandilu's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 12, +4 to hit with spell attacks). The abrikandilu can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

3/day each: fear, shatter
Siege Monster. The abrikandilu deals double damage to objects and structures.

Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft ., one target. Hit: $6(1 \mathrm{~d} 6+3)$ magical slashing damage.

## Abrikandilu Eye

Wondrous item, every rare (requires attunement)
After you have attuned to this fiendish monocle it is subsumed into your face, replacing one of your eyes. Once attuned, you gain the following benefits:

- You have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, the eye increases its range by 60 feet.
- The abrikandilu eye has 5 charges. You can expend 1 charge as an action to cast the shatter spell (save DC 12) or 2 charges to cast the fear spell (save DC 12). The eye regains all expended charges at midnight.

These powerful gifts do not come without a price, however-you cannot stand the sight of your reflection. When adjacent to a mirror or creature wielding a polished metal shield, you must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw at the start of your turn or be compelled to destroy the object casting your reflection.

In addition, the eye becomes a permanent part of your body after you have attuned to it. Removing the magic item requires removing your actual eye, lowering your Constitution by 1 and causing you to make vision-based Wisdom (Perception) checks and Intelligence (Investigation) checks with disadvantage until your normal eye is restored through regeneration or a similar powerful healing spell.
Wrecker demons that fill out the infantry of Abyssal armies, abrikandilu were destroyers of beauty in life that continue their envious vandalism for eternity. These fiends are driven to madness by the sight of their own mutated reflections and they do whatever is necessary to destroy an object showing it to them, enraged by the reminder of what they've become.

Fiendish Brilliance. The coloxus has advantage on Intelligence ability checks.
Fiendish Tongue. The coloxus is under the constant effects of a tongues spell.
Spellcasting. The coloxus is a 6th level spellcaster that uses Intelligence as its spellcasting ability (spell save DC 14; +6 to hit with spell attacks). The coloxus has the following spells prepared from the wizard's spell list:

Cantrips: acid splash, fire bolt, mage band, minor
illusion, poison spray, prestidigitation, true strike

illusory script, silent image
2nd-level (6 slots): blur, detect thoughts, invisibility,
locate object, see invisibility, mirror image
3rd-level (5 slots): clairvoyance, fear, baste (self
only), hypnotic pattern, major image
ACTIONS
Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft ., one target. Hit: $9(1 \mathrm{~d} 8+5)$ slashing damage.
Droning Wings. As an action, the coloxus can flutter its wings to conjure a kaleidoscope of color and a drone that dampens other sounds. The coloxus gains immunity to thunder damage and creatures within a 30 -foot radius have disadvantage on Constitution saving throws made to maintain concentration on spells that have verbal components.

Many a mage have looked too deeply into forbidden lore, forever staining their souls with failed attempts to grasp at powers beyond mortal ken. When the cursed finally perishes they may be drawn down into the Abyss, the finality of their demise reinterpreted by demon handlers to be seen as an ascension instead. Thus coloxus are incredibly confident in their power, overwhelmingly certain that they are truly masters of the arcane without

156
peer. The illusion that they reside within is so whole and encompassing that nothing in existence can convince them otherwise-and they keep any mortal foolish enough to believe the charade in bondage as servants, the fear the coloxus' "terrible power" bearing down on them at all times.

Malevolent eyes leer out from the grotesque flesh of this monster's face, its macabre skin stretched tight between its locomotive body and the engine at its head. A terrible wailing comes from the damned railcars trailing behind it, the faces of the passengers trapped within paralyzed in rictuses of agony.

Damned Railcars. A line of ghostly carriages bump and trundle behind the equos demon, carrying captured souls. While inside of a damned railcar, a creature has the incapacitated condition and cannot be healed in any way. The creature can look out from the windows and be seen doing so, but is otherwise unable to communicate or be affected by anything outside of the damned railcar. A creature inside a damned railcar cannot be regurgitated and when the equos demon dies it is no longer incapacitated, requiring 300 feet of movement to exit the back of corpse.
Lined Movement. The equos demon can only travel in straight lines once it has begun its movement. At the beginning of its turn, an equos demon can change direction by reducing its speed that round by 10 feet per 45 degrees turned.
Magic Resistance. The equos demon has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects. Siege Monster. The equos demon deals double damage to objects and structures.
Steel equos have been targeted by crime since their inception, sabotaged rails and hijacked locomotives terrifying early travelers until the Justitia stepped in and began policing them. The greatest of railway terrors come from the doings of mad scientists however, the weaknesses of the infrastructure exploited to cause crashes that accomplished nothing but damning thousands to death-and at the hands of Caskette, far worse. These victims ride long after their demise, trapped in the demonic corpse-flesh of the vessel that carried them to their ends. Evil spellcasters will do anything to capture a demon equos, the power offered by sacrificing one (and all its passengers) untold of in the modern age.

## ACTIONS

Multiattack. The equos demon makes one charging slam attack and one bite attack or swallow attack. Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft ., one target. Hit: $24(4 \mathrm{~d} 8+6)$ magical piercing damage and the target is grappled (escape DC 18).
Charging Slam. Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft ., one target. Hit: $28(4 \mathrm{~d} 10+6)$ magical bludgeoning damage. A target that takes 30 or more damage is knocked prone.
Swallow. The equos demon makes one bite attack against a Large or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target takes the bite damage and is swallowed, ending the grappled condition. While swallowed the creature is blinded and restrained, has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the equos demon, and it takes $17(5 \mathrm{~d} 6)$ force damage at the start of each of the equos demon's turns. If the equos demon takes 25 damage or more (before damage resistances) on a single turn from a creature inside it, the equos demon must succeed on a DC 23 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the equos demon. If the equos demon dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 30 feet of movement, exiting prone. Once a creature reaches 0 hit points or has been swallowed by the equos demon for 3 rounds, it ceases taking damage and is moved into one of the equos demon's damned railcars at the end of its turn.

Gray hairs make a savage beard around the fanged mouth of this aged imp, its borns long since broken off near their base and its decayed wings bearing it aloft by the power of magic-wbile it is undoubtedly a detestable and wicked creature, it is bard not to find its tiny glasses a touch endearing.

Devil's Spectacles. Magical darkness doesn't impede the imp-erosis darkvision while it is wearing its spectacles. Without its spectacles, the imp-erosis darkvision reduces to 30 feet.
Invisibility (Recharge 5-6). As a
bonus action, the imp-erosil magically turns invisible until it attacks or until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment the imp wears or carries is invisible with it. The imp-erosil can recharge this feature by spending its action. Magic Resistance. The imp-erosil has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects. In addition, it is under the constant effects of a mage armor spell.
Scroll Reader. The imp-erosil is able to use any magic scroll for spells of 4 th-level or lower.

## ACTIONS

Sting (Bite in Beast Form). Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft ., one target. Hit: $5(1 \mathrm{~d} 4+3)$ piercing damage, and the target must make on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
Shapechanger. The imp-erosil can use its action to polymorph into a Small beast or back into its true form. Its statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.

It isn't safe to attempt to escape Hell but what can be done in the realm of devils that does not result in harsh and severe punishment? Some imps take the risk of and cross over into the Abyss, becoming thralls to demons. Once removed from their home, age takes its toll and withers their bodies, but not without expanding the fiend's mind. Gradually it transforms into an imp-erosil demon, mastering its innate magics and always seeking to steal power (be it arcane or divine) from others.

Accuser devils are the souls of children that have been cast down to Hell, warped into stealthy sentries that can garner valuable secrets and share them with their masters without deception or guile.

Weaving through the air on sickly spotted wings is a beaked fiend, barbs sprouting from beneath its beastly arms to cover a kaleidoscope of iridescent insectile scales that end in a wicked two-pronged stinger.

When powerful mages beseech dark powers, contract devils use their acumen with words and understanding of fell agreements to entrap all but the cleverest bargainers. These fiends frequently goad fools into making deals without realizing their error-a mistake that proves severe indeed. When forced to enact rites through the accursed Bands of Kyttarmoak or to entreat a weak mind within a holy place, contract devils use their magic to act through intermediaries or strike deals which they are positive can be collected upon after a mortal has passed on or traveled beyond the bounds of Askis.

Hit: $8(1 \mathrm{~d} 6+5)$ bludgeoning damage.
Infernal Net. Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, range 5/15 ft., one target. A
Huge or smaller creature hit by the infernal net is restrained until it is freed.
A creature can use its action to make a DC 16 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 10 slashing damage to the infernal net (AC 13) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the infernal net.

Most of Hell's legions are compelled to battle when called upon but not every soldier does as ordered and warmonger devils are responsible for enforcing morale in the weak of arm. Even without a phalanx of troops around them however the fiends are terrors in combat, capturing foes before mercilessly stabbing them to death. They are sometimes mistaken for erinyes-one of their many tactics to better implement command through fear-though they never claim as such, fearful of reprisal from their deadlier counterparts. When summoned by a mortal a warmonger devil is exacting and efficient, doing as they are bid to the very letter (which can be vexing indeed in the midst of battle).
