FOREWORD

VE ALWAYS BEEN A BIT OF A CITY BOY. MY
upbringing in London and Tokyo taught me to appreciate urban life for its diversity and unpredictable edge. It's no surprise that my first Dungeons and Dragons campaigns took place in imaginary cities.
Waterdeep represents everything I love about city life: boundless opportunity, rich history, communal pride, and the constant sense of danger just around the corner. Chapter 9 of Waterdeep: Dragon Heist paints a vivid picture of this legendary metropolis, providing all the background you need to begin your own adventures in the city. With Waterdeep: City Encounters, I hoped to bring the city to life on your gaming table with over a hundred short encounters you can pull at any time as your group explores.
For this endeavor, I recruited my own gang from the ranks of the Guild Adepts and let them loose on the wards of Waterdeep. I think you'll like what they found.

## OVERVIEW

Waterdeep: City Encounters presents over a hundred short encounters to bring the City of Splendors to life at your gaming table. The supplement comprises the following sections:

- Random City Encounters. Dozens of random encounters for every ward in the city.
- Location Encounters. An encounter for almost every location mentioned in the city guide of Waterdeep: Dragon Heist.
- Appendix 1. Waterdeep Weather. Tables for determining the weather in Waterdeep for all four seasons.
- Appendix 2. Monster $\boldsymbol{\&}$ NPC Statistics. Statistics for creatures listed in Volo's Guide to Monsters or Waterdeep: Dragon Heist.
Waterdeep: City Encounters requires use of the D\&D fifth edition core rulebooks (Player's Handbook, Dungeon Master's Guide, and Monster Manual). When a creature's name appears in bold type, that's a reference to its stat block in the Monster Manual. If the creature is listed in Volo's Guide to Monsters or Waterdeep: Dragon Heist, its stat block is reproduced with permission in appendix 2.

# Part One: Random City EngOounters 

![img-3.jpeg](assets/Waterdeep%20City%20Encounters_img-3.jpeg)

ANDOM ENCOUNTERS CAN OCCUR AT ANY TIME while exploring the city. Such encounters add mystery, intrigue, and danger to exploration, reinforcing the impression that the characters are never truly alone, and that urban life continues around them.
Roll for random encounters as often as you like. Good times to roll are when the characters move between locations, or each time they enter a new ward. The encounters here are balanced for characters of levels 1-4, but dangerous outliers do feature. Players be warned!

Most encounters occur during business hours, which run late in most wards. No tables are provided for the dead of night, as the city sleeps during these hours and the streets are empty save for lamplighters and City Watch patrols. All encounters are reusable if rolled more than once.
This section also includes four randomized tables: Random Factions, Random Guilds, Random Goods, and Waterdeep Rumors. Use these as directed by the text, or as needed to add color and flavor to your own adventures.

## Angry Mob

1d4 rabble-rousing thugs lead an angry mob of 2 d 12 commoners through the streets, chanting political slogans, vandalizing storefronts, or otherwise causing upset. Roll a d4 to determine who they are:

1. Hooligans from the Guild of Butchers drag a halfling pie-maker through the streets. As punishment for selling unlicensed scotched eggs, the vigilantes have dipped the halfling in butter and rolled him in mince and breadcrumbs.
2. Frustrated drivers from the Fellowship of Carters \& Coachmen barricade the street to protest the growing popularity of double-decked dray carriages. The drivers are upturning a passing dray carriage when the characters arrive, much to the consternation of its passengers.
3. Storekeepers rally against the proposed "Door Levy", which taxes business owners for every door in their premises. The protestors rip the doors from every storefront that refuses to donate to their cause.
4. Youthful agitators protest the anonymity afforded to the Lords of Waterdeep. They surround anyone wearing a mask and try to tear it from their face. Ironically, the agitators wear masks to hide their identities from the authorities.

## ASSASSINATION

A passing figure drives a dagger into another person's back and then flees the scene. Roll a d4 to determine who they are:

1. Two sisters embroiled in a long-running legal dispute over the modest estate left by their father.
2. The victim was a lawyer involved in the prosecution of a powerful gangster. Her assailant is an assassin who was sent to silence her.
3. The assailant was forced to commit the murder because of a geas cast by a wicked enchanter, who harbored a grudge against the victim after she rejected his romantic advances.
4. The assailant is a cambion who has recently come to the city and takes sadistic delight in attacking random strangers.

## Awakened Tree

The characters come across a tree laden with ripe apples, regardless of season. The tree bears a sign that reads "Please pick an apple." Numerous items are piled around its roots, from colorful scarves to a coin pouch containing 17 cp . Any creature taking an apple from the tree must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or be compelled to leave a random possession at the tree's base and forget they ever owned it. Anyone who tries to take one of the items is walloped by the awakened tree.

## Beer Tide

A fermenter full of beer in a nearby brewery bursts and hundreds of gallons of golden elixir churn into the streets! The flash flood jeopardizes one or more of the locals! Roll a d4 to find out who is affected or choose up to four results.

1. The flood has washed a young child away from his mother and is carrying him toward an open manhole 60 -feet away from the group. Any character who wades over to the drain and succeeds on a DC 9 Strength (Athletics) check can yank the child from the flood before it washes him into the sewers.
2. A trio of City Watch guards were arresting a criminal when the flood occurred. In the confusion, the bandit escaped and is now running towards the characters. If the characters capture the ne'er-do-well, they earn the thanks of the City Watch. To the contrary, if they help her escape, she may repay them when they least expect it.
3. An old woman's flower cart has toppled over in the flood. While the cart is mostly intact, all her flowers have been lost: as has her livelihood. 5 gp is enough for her to restock, and she's extremely thankful if the characters help in such a way. Alternatively, the characters can seek out the miserly owner of the brewery and attempt a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check to solicit compensation.
4. The flood rushes towards the characters! Characters who succeed on a DC 9 Dexterity (Acrobatics) or Strength (Athletics) check are able to jump out of the way or clamber up a nearby street lamp. Characters who fail are washed down the street, taking 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage and ending up covered in sticky, half-fermented beer.

## Beggar

A middle-aged lightfoot halfling wererat named Larca Shineforth approaches the characters in her humanoid form, begging for coin. If the group contains halflings, any character who succeeds on a Wisdom (Perception) check opposed by Larca's Dexterity (Stealth) check notices she's been following them at a distance. Larca is sizing up them up for recruitment to the "Shard Shunners", a gang of halfling wererats of which she is a member.
Larca singles out any halfling character who displays competency in Dexterity-based ability checks or Charisma-based ability checks. She waits until she can speak with that halfling alone, and then promises them great power in return for loyalty to her gang. Whether or not the character accepts, Larca transforms into her hybrid form and attempts to bite the character to infect them with wererat lycanthropy.
If you roll this encounter again, a different beggar approaches the group for alms.

---

## Book Keeper

Linden Tallowick. a half-elf apprentice wizard (see appendix 2), walks out in front of a horse while carrying a teetering pile of books. Linden is knocked prone with his books scattered around him, where he lies stunned but unharmed. A callous soul could steal his history books and sell them as a lot for 20 gp .
If helped, Linden introduces the characters to his mistress Vajra Safahr, the Blackstaff, who is always looking to hire adventurers (for more details on these the Blackstaff, see appendix B of Waterdeep: Dragon Heist). If you repeat this encounter, the characters meet Tallowick again, this time without his pile of books.

## Book Thief

The Font of Knowledge in the Castle Ward is Waterdeep's largest public library. The faithful of Oghma keep a watchful eye over the shelves, but thefts still occur. While the characters are passing through the ward, they encounter one of these thieves fresh from the job. Roll a d4 to determine who they meet:

1. A penniless acolyte of Chauntea has stolen a series of self-help romance books to woo a noble's daughter. When the tomes tumble from under his robes, the poor wretch breaks down and confesses his sins to the characters.
2. An unschooled kenku offers to pay the characters 5 gp if they read aloud from her stolen book on powered flight. If they do so, she becomes obsessed with piloting a hang-glider and beseeches the characters to help her build it.
3. An apprentice wizard (see appendix 2) tears off and devours the pages of a library book as five acolytes of Oghma chase him down the street. The mad apprentice believes that he must consume knowledge to truly understand it.
4. A halfling bandit tries to hawk the "Spellbook of Halaster Blackcloak" for 50 gp . The book is nothing of the sort but is clearly marked property of the Font of Knowledge and contains a heretical theory about the origins of wild magic.

## BROADSHEET REPORTER

Kelia Wintersbane, a sun elf spy and reporter for The Targe broadsheet, begins shadowing the characters. The Targe is prone to vitriolic pieces on all manner of local topics, and Kelia's looking to do a hit piece on the "scourge of adventurers" in the city. If the characters confront Kelia, she frames her article as a human-interest story and asks if she can interview and observe the characters for a few days. In her notes, she spins events to make the characters appear in the worst light possible. If you roll this encounter again, a reporter from a rival newspaper tries the same deal, perhaps with honest intentions this time.

## Celebrating Hero

The champion of a ward competition is carried on the shoulders of a crowd to the House of Heroes in the Sea Ward. Characters who show interest learn the date of the next ward competition and are told how to register for the event. See the "Festival Parade" and "Street Race" encounters for details on example competitions.

## CHAMBER Pot

A homeowner empties a chamber pot of "night soil" from a second story window. Each character must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or be spattered by the sloppy contents. Roll a d4 to determine who emptied the pot:

1. A maid in the service of a wealthy lawyer. Her master is abusive, and "bombing" pedestrians is one of her few little pleasures.
2. A spy belonging to the Xanathar Guild. If the adventurers protest his behavior, he smirks and says, "You have no idea who you're dealing with."
3. An absent-minded toymaker who is oblivious to what she has done. She apologizes if the characters confront her and offers them a clever clockwork toy as compensation.
4. A kenku member of the Red Sashes. If the adventurers complain, he offers to have the "bird droppings" cleaned from their clothes and attempts to recruit them to the Red Sashes.

## City Watch

A City Watch patrol marches down the street. The patrol comprises five City Watch guards and one veteran officer. If the characters have committed a crime, they must succeed on an opposed group Charisma (Deception) check versus the veteran's passive Insight of 10 to avoid attracting attention. Even if the characters have abided by the law, there's a 1-in-4 chance that the officers stop them for questioning.

## Grashed Garriage

A carriage has crashed on the street ahead. Roll a d3 to determine what's happened:

1. A pair of local guides overloaded their carriage by cramming in a trio of visiting authors. The axle broke, and now the guides must stay with the carriage while it undergoes repairs. They offer the group 25gp to escort the authors at speed to a local breakfast bar and show them a good time before their seminar.
2. Gangsters from the Xanathar Guild rammed the carriage to rob the two nobles held within. Two guards defend the noble's carriage against 1d6 hobgoblins and a hobgoblin sergeant loyal to the Xanathar Guild.
3. After crashing her carriage, the goblin driver fled the scene on foot. If caught, she reveals that she's a getaway driver for the Xanathar Guild. She's too scared to tell her boss about the crash but provides directions to his hideout if the characters offer to negotiate on her behalf (for more details on the Xanatahar, see chapter 5, "Spring Madness," of Waterdeep: Dragon Heist).

## CULTISTS

Passing through the City of the Dead, the characters hear chanting nearby. On closer inspection, they discover a group of six cultists in the throes of a religious rite. The remains of a cat lay spread out before them on an overturned headstone.
If confronted, the cultists flee in different directions. Any captured cultists shriek in pain as they bite out their own tongues to avoid betraying their faith. If you roll this encounter a second time, more cultists have returned with their cult fanatic leader to finish the ceremony.

---

To determine who the cultists worship, roll a d4.

1. Loviatar, Goddess of Pain
2. Bhaal, God of Murder.
3. Malar, God of the Hunt.
4. Talona, Goddess of Disease and Poison

## DEMON WORSHIPERS

The characters hear a scream from a nearby alley. Arronal, a warlock of the fiend (see appendix 2) and a cloaked babau (see appendix 2) have abducted a young man named Bol off the street with the intent of offering him in sacrifice to Baphomet. They've set up a demonic altar in a nearby building using five golden candle sticks worth 10 gp each. If the sacrifice goes ahead, 2 d 6 maw demons (see appendix 2) spew forth from a rift to the Abyss and rampage through the Ward.
If this encounter is rerolled, the characters encounter Bol again, but now he's gone insane and become a cult fanatic of Baphomet himself. Bol is abducting someone else to complete the demonic ritual.

## Drunken Troublemakers

The characters cross paths with two thoroughly inebriated members of the Black Boar Tribe (two berserkers). One of them bumps into randomlydetermined character and naturally takes offense. The offending character must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) check or be sucker-punched by the berserker. If the character offers to make it up with a drink, the check is made with advantage. If you roll this encounter again, use the "Random Factions" table to determine the troublemakers' allegiances.

## Ensorcelled Child

A child of roughly ten years dashes into the midst of the characters, twitching and gibbering strangely. His parents follow close behind, shouting for help.

Young Benji Tormson is a vessel for a primal spirit, which possesses him whenever he panics. If Benji succumbs to the spirit, he begins to radiate magic randomly (use the evoker stats from appendix 2). A DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check calms the child, dampening the spirit's influence. If the characters assault or kill Benji, they must answer to the parents and the authorities.
A remove curse spell can drive out the spirit, but Benji's parents can't afford to pay for the ceremony. Character who cast the spell themselves or pay 300 gp to have it cast at a temple earn the family's eternal thanks. If you roll this encounter more than once, the characters cross paths with Benji and his parents yet again.

## Fallen Money Pough

A character spots a money pouch lying in the gutter. Roll 1 d 6 to find out what's inside:

1. 1d6 gp and a note that reads "Now we're even."
2. A very angry poisonous snake.
3. Fresh horse dung.
4. A cloud of foul-smelling smoke billows from within and everyone within 5 feet of the bag reeks of rotten eggs until they next wash their clothes. Gnome mage Igglewen Cogsworthy watches from a nearby doorway and rolls over with uproarious laughter if her prank succeeds. If the characters take the joke well, she clips a clothespin to her nose and offers to buy them a round of drinks.
5. The pouch is filled with small pebbles. When a character reaches for it, a human assassin named Black Pidden attempts to stab them in the back as he walks by. He doesn't fight to the death, and if questioned reveals that he was hired by one of the group's enemies.
6. The pouch contains a fake map to the legendary Vault of Dragons. Characters who follow the trail are lured into a nearby tavern as a publicity stunt.

## Festival Parade

The characters encounter a raucous festival parade that slows progress through the streets to a crawl. Roll a d3 to determine what's happening:

1. Two wards compete to hurl a solid silver ball into a goal in their rival's ward. This violent game has just one rule: you can't move while carrying the ball. If the players join in, the first character in the group to succeed on four consecutive DC 15 Strength (Athletics) checks makes the winning throw. Failure on any of these checks results in the character taking 2 (1d4) bludgeoning damage from the flailing limbs of stampeding competitors.
2. A street food stall goes up in flames, catching the painted sails of a passing festival float. The flames roar up the float, threatening to devour the performers dancing on its roof.
3. Elaborately-costumed dancers try to cajole the group into joining their performance. If a character joins in and succeeds on a DC 15 Charisma (Performance) check, they catch the attention of a passing talent scout and are invited to visit the Sea Maiden's Faire for an audition with Zardoz Zord (see chapter 7, "Maestro's Fall," of Waterdeep: Dragon Heist).

---

## Fleeing Gutpurse

A fleeing cutpurse (a spy) slips a stolen gem worth 50 gp into a character's pocket. Any character in the group with a passive Perception score of 11 or higher sees the thief plant the gem.
A few moments after the gem is planted, a patrol of four City Watch guards arrives on the scene. If the character has the gem in hand, the guards spot it and approach with cudgels bared! Convincing the guards of the character's innocence requires surrendering the gem and a successful DC 13 Charisma (Deception or Persuasion) check. Otherwise, the character must surrender the gem and pay a fine of 50 gp to avoid hard punishment.
If you roll this encounter again, the characters spot a different cutpurse dashing through the crowds, and no gem is planted.

## Funeral

A funeral is taking place here. Roll a d3 to determine what's happening:

1. The funeral is for a City Watch officer who was killed while trying to arrest a drunken adventurer. 3d6 commoners, 3d6 guards, 1d6 veterans and one priest are in attendance. Anyone who looks like an adventurer is met with scorn and disgust.
2. A group of gangsters pose as a funeral party to exhume the grave of former comrade for the treasure map and 100gp ring she was buried with. A master thief watches while 1 d 6 thugs dig.
3. An adventuring company called the Sons of the North commemorate their fallen comrade with a few bottles of wine. The remaining members of the group comprise: Sir Humphren Boldblade (human knight),

Silandra (sun elf mage), Tala Furryfoot (lightfoot halfling priest of Cyrrollalee), and Ruc Brokentusk (half-orc berserker). Ruc is particularly grief-stricken and is looking for a fight. His friends try to stop him from coming to blows with the characters but come to his aid if combat ensues.

## Gang War

Violence is imminent. Two rival factions face off against each other in the street, or one group prepares to ambush the other. Either way, things are about to get bloody!
Roll twice on the Random Factions table to determine who's involved (reroll if the pairing seems unlikely). Most groups consist of 2 d 4 members: either acolytes, apprentice wizards (see appendix 2), bandits, bandit captains, cultists, cult fanatics, druids, goblins, guards, kobolds, nobles, priests, scouts, spies, thugs, or wererats as appropriate.

## Ghost

Rumors abound of the spirit of a young child wandering the City of the Dead. As the characters move through the cemetery, they encounter this spirit manifesting as a ghost. Speaking an archaic form of Chondathan, the child is oblivious of being dead and the circumstances surrounding their death. The child cries for their mother "Shafkii." The spirit is unable to leave the graveyard and disappears an hour after appearing. No amount of searching official records finds the name anywhere.
If you reroll this encounter, the characters encounter the same spirit again. If the spirit has been destroyed or laid to rest, the characters encounter a different ghost of your own choosing.

## Gridlock

A wagon has thrown a wheel and upturned in the middle of the street, causing a long tailback of traffic. Until the wagon is repaired, the crowded streets in this ward count as difficult terrain to move through.
The characters can be fix the wagon with a successful DC 11 Wisdom (Land Vehicle) check. In exchange for their help, the driver gives them a small portion of their cargo. Roll on the Random Goods table to determine what this gift could be.
Roll a d4 to find out why the wagon threw its wheel (see below).

1. The wagon was sabotaged by the villain of the adventure to lure the characters into a trap. If the group has no such enemy, it's a case of mistaken identity! Two thugs, a spy, and an apprentice wizard (see appendix 2) leap from a nearby alley to attack!
2. The Dungsweepers Guild has gotten tired of a nearby shop shirking its monthly payments and has decided to teach them a lesson by sabotaging a fish wagon just outside the premises. Four guild thugs are now hurling shovel-fulls of smelly fish at the shop's windows. They fight anyone who tries to stop them but flee if the characters reduce two or more of them to 0 hit points.
3. Four thugs from a small-time gang suspect that the wagon is hauling illicit goods belonging to a rival organization. They've ambushed the wagon and are likely to beat its driver to a pulp if the characters don't intervene.
4. It's just broke. Help the driver fix it, already.

## Griffon Cavalry

A griffon cavalry rider (see appendix 2) glides overhead on a griffon. Roll a d3 to determine what they're doing:

1. The rider circles overhead, scanning the nearby streets for a fugitive on-the-run. If the characters linger, run the "Fleeing Cutpurse" or "Wanted Criminal" encounter.
2. The rider is studying the flow of traffic prior to an upcoming festival. He offers the group 5 gp to move at speed to a landmark in a neighboring ward. If they accept, roll another random Waterdeep encounter while they're on route, but remember the rider is watching from overhead.
3. The griffon lands nearby, as the rider is desperate to use the lavatory. He asks the characters to mind his steed while he's gone. If the characters accept, they must succeed on a DC 13 group Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to prevent the griffon from devouring a passing horse.

## Groundskeeper

Melvyn Wake, an elderly human groundskeeper, approaches the characters with a strange tale about a seldom-visited section of the graveyard. He says that the grass there has become peculiarly muddy and smells distinctly of rot. Melvyn is too scared to investigate further and begs the characters to do so on his behalf.
Casting a detect magic spell over the area reveals powerful necromantic magic at work. If the characters excavate the ground, they find something peculiar. Roll a d4 to find out what it is.

Every time you reroll this encounter, Melvyn informs the group about a new area affected by the rot.

1. A shallow mass grave containing the bodies of twenty children. The cause of death is indiscernible, but each child has a strange symbol branded on their back: three inverted triangles arranged to resemble a larger triangle. A successful DC 17 Intelligence (Religion) check identifies this as the infernal symbol of Asmodeus.
2. A black stone sarcophagus that contains skeletal remains swilling in a pool of stinking red fluid. A tin tiara rests on the skeleton's brow, inscribed with a rune that a successful DC 13 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals to mean "patience." If the tiara is removed, a wraith coalesces from the sludge and attacks whomever holds the tiara.
3. A heavy stone slab covers the entrance to a hitherto unknown crypt. Inside the crypt, a glass coffin contains the perfectly preserved body of a beautiful Chultan woman in her late-40s. There are no indications or clues as to the body's identity, and the crypt isn't identified on any official records.
4. The characters unearth a featureless black stone orb from the oozing muck. Divination magic yields no clues about it, but any creature that carries the orb in their possession for more than a tenday is haunted by dreams of drowning in stinking, black slime. Each morning thereafter, roll a die. If the result is odd, the character must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or be afflicted by a shortterm madness (see "Madness" in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Masters Guide).

## Guide

A guide approaches the characters, offering to lead them to one of the following locations for just 1 sp . Each of these destinations has its own encounter in the "Location Encounters" section. Roll a d6 to determine the destination:

1. Tower of Luck (Sea Ward)
2. New Olamn's Academy of Music (Castle Ward)
3. House of Heroes (Sea Ward)
4. Shrines to Nature (Sea Ward)
5. Jade Dancer (Southern Ward)
6. Court of the White Bull (Trades Ward)

## Guild War

Waterdeep's guilds furiously protect their trades for the good of their members. This often puts them at odds with each other, or with other factions in the City of Splendors. The characters witness a brawl between two rival guilds, with 2 d 8 commoners involved on each side. Roll twice on the Random Guilds table to determine which guilds are involved.

## Halfling Thief

Wents, a halfling master thief (see appendix 2), just stole a candle of the invocation (neutral good) from a nearby house and is looking to move it fast. He claims it belongs to his sick mother, and its sale will pay for her medical bills. Wents offers the item to the characters for 500 gp but is secretly willing to be bargained down to 75 gp for a quick sale.

Shortly after Wents leaves, five guards from the City Watch stop the characters and search them for the candle. If they find it, they charge the characters with burglary unless the characters can prove that Wents is the real culprit. If you reroll this encounter, the characters spot Wents again in the crowd.

## Haywire Experiment

An unforeseen accident causes the release of a dreadful creation from the House of Inspired Hands. The haywire experiment rages through the streets, chased by 1 d 4 acolytes! Roll a d4 to determine what it is

1. A helmed horror is intent on causing as much damage as possible. Its armor is white hot, having just emerged from the forges. Any creature that strikes the helmed horror with a melee attack takes 3 (1d6) fire damage.
2. A shield guardian is marching in a straight line towards a random location in the Trades Ward, regardless of what stands in its way; people, carts, houses, walls. One of the acolytes clutches its broken control amulet in its hands.
3. Four gargoyles swoop around the neighborhood, grabbing passersby and dropping them from height, cackling all the while.
4. A rug of smothering slithers between the storefronts, attempting to scoop up and carry as many objects as possible. The rug mercilessly smothers any creature that gets in the way of its work, from horses through pedestrians.

## High Stakes Gamblers

Two berserkers and a gladiator are playing a dangerous dice game. If a character shows interest, the gamblers offer them a chair but warn that the stakes are high. Whomever scores lowest in each game must chop off their own left hand, while the highest-scoring player gets to keep the pot. The gladiator carries a potion of greater healing to prevent the loser from bleeding to death.
If a character joins the game but later decides not to play or refuses the punishment, the three gamblers angrily decide to teach them a lesson. If you reroll this encounter, the characters encounter the same group, but this time they're all missing their hands and are playing for their feet instead.

## Hue and Gry

The nearby citizens erupt into a "hue and cry": a communal effort to hunt down a criminal by shouting, banging drums, and searching together until the City Watch arrives. If the characters join the mob, they can attempt a DC 12 group Intelligence (Investigation) check to locate the criminal. Use the "Wanted Criminal" encounter to determine who their quarry is. If they locate the crook, 2 d 10 angry commoners accompany them into any confrontation.

## Illegal Duel

Two nobles prepare to fight an illegal duel in the street. Roll a d4 to determine the circumstances of their feud:

1. The nobles duel for the heart of a maiden they both desire, who watches in horror from a nearby doorway.

---

2. The nobles have gotten into a long and tedious argument over the updated rules of a dice-based parlour game they both play. With neither side willing to compromise, they've decided that only blood can settle their dispute.
3. A noble has challenged his wayward son (a bandit) to a duel for his son's inheritance. If the son defeats his father, he wins his estate.
4. The nobles are feigning their dispute to goad passersby into intervening. If the characters get involved, three veteran bodyguards step from the shadows to attack them while the nobles bet on who'll win.

## Lost Pet

The characters find a small household pet that appears well cared-for but is alone and frightened. If the characters succeed on a DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check, they can track down the pet's rightful owner. Roll a d4 to see who lost the pet:

1. Homeless teenager Nix has lost her puppy Nibbles. She devotes what little coin she earns to caring for Nibbles, so while grateful for his return, she has no cash to offer as reward. Instead, she'll gladly do odd jobs for the group, such as delivering messages, fetching water, or caring for their mounts: something she shows real talent for.
2. Lug Toothbreaker is an enormous half-orc thug who angrily assumes that the characters have stolen his puppy Facechewer as soon as he sees them. He gathers up three of his thug buddies to rough up the characters and recover his puppy.
3. Alixian the half-elf bard is looking for his cat Sonata, and joyfully composes a song about the great heroes who rescued her. His tale grows in the telling and in short order the characters are known throughout the ward as having faced down the vile Xanathar to rescue Sonata. How the Xanathar feels about these upstarts remains to be seen, but the crime boss is not well known for allowing challenges to his reputation...
4. Noblewoman Amanthea Silverstar has lost her beloved ermine Elysia and rewards the group with a potion of healing for returning her pet.

## Luck SeEker

A hapless adventurer stops the characters for directions to the Tower of Luck. If you need to introduce a new character or supporting NPC, this fateful meeting could be the perfect opportunity. If not, the adventurer imparts a story from the Waterdeep Rumors table before heading on their way.

## Magister

A black-cloaked judge marches down the street, escorted by four veteran City Watch officers and an apprentice wizard (see appendix 2) from the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors. If the characters carry magic items, there is a $10 \%$ chance per item that the apprentice wizard detects a disruption in the Weave, causing the magister to order a stop-and-search on the group.

## Masked Lord

An ornate carriage thunders past, with a masked noble visible behind its silken drapes. The Masked Lord watches the group with some interest as the carriage pulls away. If
![img-4.jpeg](assets/Waterdeep%20City%20Encounters_img-4.jpeg)
you roll this encounter again, the Masked Lord suspects the characters of following them, and dispatches three thugs to rough them up and question them.

## Mistaken Identity

One of the characters is mistaken for someone else. Roll a d6 to determine the cause of the confusion:

1. An angry mother mistakes the character for the rapscallion who seduced her son or daughter. She begins following the character through the ward demanding to know the whereabouts of her grown child. If she can determine where the characters are staying, she may even hire others to follow and investigate the group.
2. The character is mistaken by a veteran member of the City Watch for a cutpurse he's been searching for.
3. A delivery boy inaccurately identifies the character as the recipient for the wedding cake he's delivering.
4. An assassin mistakes one of the characters for his target.
5. An imp believes that the character has been marked by Asmodeus for great evil and thus tries to buy their soul.
6. An intoxicated noble believes the character is one of her retainers and begins dishing out orders.

---

## Muggers

2d4 thugs accost the group, threatening a severe beating if the characters don't hand over their belongings. The thugs donate any money they steal to the old cleric who runs the temple orphanage in which they were raised (see location 27, "The Hospice of St. Laupsenn," in "Location Encounters"). If the characters defeat the thugs, the next group of muggers they encounter aren't so benevolent.

## Murder Victim

The characters unearth the corpse of a murdered citizen. Roll a d3 to determine who they find:

1. The stench of rotting meat wafts from a discarded barrel. Inside is the corpse of a young male dwarf who shows signs of being strangled. In his boot is a scrap of leather with the following message scratched into it: "Ixia, 517 Waterdeep Way, come alone."
2. An uncannily lifelike statue of an elf lies shattered in a nearby alley. If reassembled, the statue depicts a woman scrambling backward in horror, wearing only one shoe. A matching shoe lies in the mud nearby but is not made from stone!
3. The exsanguinated corpse of a halfling sprawls in a doorway. A search of her body reveals two small puncture wounds on her neck. The halfling was holding a fresh bunch of grapes when she died.

## Newsprint Seller

A newsprint seller sings out the latest events to befall the City of Splendors. Choose a notable event from your own campaign story, adapt something from the Waterdeep Rumors table, or roll a d4 to determine today's news:

1. Strangers across the Castle Ward have reported mysterious lapses of memory: a few hours here, a day there. Suspecting a curse, the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors has announced an investigation into the matter.
2. One of the characters is named as a murderer! The character is accused of murdering a noble during a gambling game, with an accurate description of their appearance published in the newsprint.
3. The Sea Maidens Faire has a special discount deal tonight: three-for-two entry on the gangplank with one free drink provided per person! For further details on the faire, see chapter 7, "Maestro's Fall," of Waterdeep: Dragon Heist.
4. The seller presses a free copy of the newsprint into a character's hands. Moving off, the character notices that the publication date is a tenday into the future! Glancing back to the seller, the characters see that he has mysteriously vanished.

## NimblewRight

A nimblewright (see appendix 2) darts through the crowd on an urgent errand. Characters hunting for such a creature during chapter 3 of Waterdeep: Dragon Heist are alerted to its approach via their nimblewright detector. The nimblewright refuses to stop. Use the chase rules in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master's Guide if the characters give pursuit.
The nimblewright could be Nim, the creature from chapter 3 of Waterdeep: Dragon Heist, or another nimblewright serving a powerful master in the city. In either case, the nimblewright carries a casket containing a private letter that accidentally reveals the identity of a

Masked Lord of Waterdeep. Such a find can be sold on the black market for 100 gp .

## Noble and Retinue

Four servants carry a noble through the crowds on an ornate palanquin, escorted by two veteran bodyguards. Roll a d3 to determine what happens:

1. To settle a bet, the noble demands to know a "commoner's thoughts" on his own appearance. After the noble poses the question, his bodyguards silently signal that the characters had better be generous with their praise. If they criticize the noble, he angrily orders his bodyguards to "teach them some wespect!".
2. The noble suspects his husband is having an affair. He offers the characters 100 gp to spy on his husband and return with evidence to prove or disprove his claim.
3. One of the bearers passes out. If the characters help him out, he's reveals he was tipped one too many drinks during a night out with his mistress and Mirt the Moneylender. Assuming the characters are polite, the noble grants them a letter of introduction to present at Mirt's Mansion in the Castle Ward.

## Orc (With Pie)

A thin and disheveled urchin is bawling her eyes out on the sidewalk. When questioned, she says that a nasty orc stole her pork pie. Roll a d3 to determine the real situation:

1. The orc is around the corner, in a narrow, dirty alley. He's homeless and hungry and is just about to consume the pie. If threatened, 1d4 homeless orcs come to his aid, armed with improvised clubs.
2. The orc is dressed respectably and speaks impeccable Common. He claims to be a journalist, and says the child threatened to "get him" when he refused to share his pie with her.
3. There is no orc nor pie. The child is a disguised enchanter who lures adventurers down quiet alleyways, casts sleep spells on them, and then transforms her sleeping victims into orcs! If she dupes the characters, they find that the transformative effect lasts for 24 hours, after which time they return to their proper forms.

## Otyugh

The characters notice a crowd gathered around rock gnome inventor Dandyforth Zalesbottom (an apprentice wizard, see appendix 2). The gnome pushes a huge iron box with four wheels over the dung-covered ground of the Field Ward. The dung is sucked up through holes in the underside of the box, which shakes, rumbles, and belches as Dandyforth pushes it about and boasts to the crowd about his new magical invention: the poopsweeper!
Just before the gnome can reveal the price of his creation, the box bursts open and the true "magic" of the poopsweeper is revealed. A hungry otyugh Dandyforth caught in the sewers breaks free of its prison and begins attacking the crowd! If the characters intervene, the otyugh fights to the death. As reward for dealing with the problem - and keeping quiet about it - Dandyforth offers the characters two spell scrolls of disguise self.
If you reroll this encounter, the characters are attacked by a different otyugh living in the ward's dung heaps.

---

## Peddler

Nervous gnome peddler Gloriphur Amblewise offers to sell the characters a magic bag for 50 gp . Roll a d4 to determine what's on offer (see below). A detect magic spell reveals that either the bag or its contents are indeed magical.

After making the deal, Gloriphur walks away quickly. If you roll this encounter again, he approaches the characters to hawk another mysterious bag.

1. The bag is an empty bag of holding that Gloriphur stole from a barbarian associated with Force Grey. If a character wears the bag in plain sight, the angry berserker may notice it elsewhere in the city.
2. The bag is not magical but contains 4 potions of greater healing stolen from a Bregan D'aerthe safehouse.
3. The bag holds a common magic item of your choice.
4. The bag holds a captured shadow demon. When the bag is opened, the demon is released to seek vengeance on its captors.

## Pickpocket

A bandit "accidentally" bumps into one of the characters and tries to lift their purse. Roll a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check for the bandit opposed by the character's passive Perception. On a success, the bandit steals some money or a small item of importance from the character. When the character later learns of their loss, they can attempt a DC 12 Intelligence (Insight) check to recall the thief's face.

## PilgRIMS

Pilgrims wearing traveling clothes march through the city, singing the praises of their god. They encourage passersby to join them in visiting one of the following temples, each of which has its own encounter in the "Location Encounters" section.
Roll a d6 to determine their destination:

1. Temple of the Seldarine (Location 9, Castle Ward)
2. House of Inspired Hands (Location 22, Sea Ward)
3. Spires of the Morning (Location 8, Castle Ward)
4. House of Wonder (Location 18, Sea Ward)
5. Temple of Beauty (Location 23, Sea Ward)
6. Font of Knowledge (Location 3, Castle Ward)

## Plague Carrier

A barely-conscious commoner rides slowly through the streets on a draft horse, swaying back and forth in the saddle. Anyone approaching the rider sees that they have the symptoms of a terrible and contagious disease (see "Diseases" in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Masters Guide). Roll a d3 to determine which disease the commoner has:

1. Cackle Fever
2. Sewer Plague
3. Sight Rot

## Rat Swarm

A young rider is having trouble controlling their steed: the horse is rearing up on its hind legs, nearly causing them to fall off. The horse is frightened by a swarm of rats pouring from the gutters. If you roll this encounter a second time, the characters encounter the rat swarm but not the rider.

---

## Refugees

A bedraggled group of refugees stumbles past, looking for a safe place to rest. They could be runaways from Luskan, mutinied galley slaves, villagers whose home was raided, or anyone else in need of shelter. New to the city and short on coin, they warily ask the characters for directions to the nearest temple.
If the characters go above and beyond to help the refugees, they offer their services when the characters next need assistance. Once fed and rested, they can supply 1d3 guards to support the characters in times of need.
If you roll this encounter a second time, the refugees belong to a faction that may prove dangerous if crossed. Roll on the Random Faction table to determine where their allegiances lie.

## Religious Procession

A religious procession moves down the street toward the characters. Roll a d4 to determine who they are.

1. Eight worshippers of Ilmater chant for alms to feed the wretched. Any character who makes a generous donation gains inspiration.
2. Four devotees of Mystra march through the street casting spells to celebrate their goddess's bounty. The acolytes use thaumaturgy and other harmless spells to entertain those watching. From hiding, a Thayan apprentice wizard (see appendix 2) targets an onlooker with a fire bolt spell to make it look like the devotees attacked the crowd. Unless the characters identify the culprit, the crowd turns on the devotees.
3. A funeral procession led by a priest of Kelemvor and two acolytes shuffles through the streets.

The departed was a beloved entertainer in the city, so throngs of adoring fans follow. Members of Manshoon's Zhentarim hope to rob the wealthier members of the procession, so they animate the body as a wight. When the wight springs from the coffin, 3d6 Zhent bandits charge in to turn over the crowd.
4. Eight actors dressed in motley move down street performing tricks, juggling, and acrobatics. They wear holy symbols of Tymora but are secretly cultists of Elemental Evil planning to sow chaos in the city. When the time is right, they carry out a deadly attack before removing their disguises and blending in with the confused and panicked crowd.

## Robbery in Progress

The characters pass a shop where a robbery is in progress. Four thugs are threatening the owner with weapons and demanding the money in the till. The criminals grab the money and attempt to escape if the characters intervene.

## Runaway Cart

Merchants, farmers, and all manner of market traders bring goods to Waterdeep. On occasion a cart is pushed aside or rolls down a hill uncontrolled. In this instance, the cart careens towards the characters, who must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity Saving throw or take 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage as the cart crashes into them. Roll on the Random Goods table to find out what the cart carries. If you roll this encounter again, the characters witness an unmanned cart trundling toward a crowd of pedestrians.

## Sea Spawn

The party witnesses 2d4 sea spawn (see appendix 2) climbing out of the water and breaking into a dockside building. Hiding inside is Silett Blueshell, a human kraken priest (see appendix 2) who betrayed the sea hag Agges Siltsip and stole a magical pearl from her. Agges has sent her spawn to retrieve her pearl and punish Silett.
If rescued, Silett tries to persuade the characters to hunt down Agges by spinning whatever lies seem most likely to motivate them. Silett carries 200 gp in carved coral pieces and the hag's pearl of power.
If this entry is rolled again, the character cross paths with Agges the sea hag as she hunts for her pearl with 1d4 sea spawn.

## SEER

A seer accosts the characters. She claims to have seen a glimpse of their future, which she offers to reveal if they pay her 5 gp . Roll a d 4 to determine her prophecy:

1. The seer provides a cryptic warning about the next foe they'll face in battle. The characters gain advantage on their initiative checks for that battle.
2. The seer predicts a terrible demise for the group! She's correct with her prediction but has the wrong party of adventurers. The next day, the characters hear about a different adventuring group that died in the same way the seer predicted.
3. The seer is a con artist whose predictions are orchestrated by her allies in the Xanathar Guild. After gaining the characters' trust, she lures them into a gang ambush.
4. The seer warns the characters that death is coming NOW from the skies! All characters in the group must make a DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check: on a success they realize that the seer is tricking them. If they fail, they look up and are surprised when two assassins from House Cassalanter step from the shadows to attack.

## SeIZed Ship

A sailing ship has defied the Guild of Watermen by attempting to unload its cargo without their assistance. The vessel has been seized under guild law, and 2d4 guild thugs are busy hurling its cargo into the water. Roll on the Random Goods table to determine what cargo the ship is carrying.

## Sewer Backup

Waterdeep's vast sewer network not only transports bodily waste, it also provides a secret highway under the city. Often the sewers get clogged and spill out onto the streets from ruptured pipes or manholes.
Roll a d4 to determine what - or who - emerges from the dark. Any creature taking damage during this encounter risks being infected by Darkrot, a disease native to the Waterdeep sewers (see the "Darkrot" sidebar).

1. A tidal wave of sewage surges from the sewers! All creatures in its path must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone and risk contracting Darkrot.
2. A group of 1 d 6 bandits flee from a giant crocodile. Use the Random Faction table to determine the bandits' allegiance.
3. Junk litters the street following a recent upsurge from the sewers. Roll on the Random Goods table to see if
it's salvageable, but anyone handling it is exposed to Darkrot infection.
4. A horde of 2 d 10 zombies shambles from a breach in the sewer tunnels.

## Darkrot

Darkrot is a disease that incubates in the sewers of Waterdeep and the refuse heaps of Rat Hill. Its effects are transmitted by exposure to sewer waste or to the creatures that dwell within, such as rats and otyughs.
When a humanoid creature is bitten by a creature infected with Darkrot or spends a minute in contact with filth or offal contaminated by the disease, the creature must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become infected.
If contaminated waste is disturbed by digging, explosive spellcasting, fire, or combat, each creature within 30 feet must make an immediate saving throw to avoid infection.
It takes 1d3 days for Darkrot's symptoms to manifest in an infected creature. Symptoms include labored breathing with a hissing rasp and large black blotches on the skin. An infected creature suffers one level of exhaustion and regains only half the normal number of hit points from spending Hit Dice. Infected creatures don't regain any hit points from finishing a long rest.
At the end of each long rest, an infected creature must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature gains one level of exhaustion. On a successful save, its exhaustion level decreases by one level. If a successful saving throw reduces the infected creature's level of exhaustion to zero, the creature recovers from the disease.

## Ship CriMP

Under Waterdeep's tough maritime laws, it's a crime for a sailor to abscond from service if they've already signed a ship's contract. A "crimp" is a hired criminal who uses coercion and violence to force sailors into signing up for understaffed merchants.
Roll a d3 to determine how the characters meet their crimp:

1. A friendly veteran offers to buy the characters a drink if they join him a local tavern. He laces their drinks with torpor (see "Poisons" in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master's Guide,) and forces any character who succumbs to the effect to sign a ship's contract.
2. The characters witness a pair of thugs bullying a drunken sailor into signing their contract.
3. A spy for a local merchant pushes a blackmail note into a character's hand, which promises to "unleash violence on your family like the untamed hounds of hell" unless the character signs a ship's contract. It's most likely a case of mistaken identity, but the characters needn't know that!

## Sink Hole

A poorly-maintained section of the street crumbles underneath a randomly-determined character. The victim must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or fall into the sewers below. Roll a d4 to determine what happens next:

---

1. The character falls into a river of stinking sludge and is swept downstream. Any character exposed to the sewage risks infection from Darkrot (see the "Darkrot" sidebar).
2. The character falls onto a brick walkway, taking 7 (3d6) bludgeoning damage.
3. The character falls into an underground chamber being used as a hideout by a trio of thugs led by a spy. Awkward.
4. The character falls into a basement hiding a cache of stolen goods stamped with the mark of a local wholesaler. Roll on the Random Goods table to determine what they are. If the characters return the goods to their owner, she awards them 25 gp and a potion of healing. Characters who handle the goods earn the enmity of a small, local gang of thieves who may seek revenge later.

## Smugglers

A gang of $1 \mathrm{~d} 4+4$ bandit smugglers unload a wagon of contraband into a nearby warehouse. Seeing the characters, they warn them to keep moving and keep what they've seen to themselves. If the characters move on, one bandit tails them to check they don't report to the crime to the City Watch. Roll a d3 to determine what the wagon contains:

1. Five crates of vintage Tethyrian whiskey worth 100 gp each.
2. Fifteen halfling children intended to be sold as kitchen assistants.
3. Salacious newsprints that threaten to blow the lid off the aristocracy's scandalous dealings with known villains.

## Snake Oil Salesman

A salesman stands on a fruit crate, touting a colorful tonic as a cure for all ailments. The salesman offers to sell the tonic for 20 gp but can be bargained down to 5 gp . There's a $10 \%$ chance that the tonic works as a potion of vitality, but otherwise it is useless.

## SOLICITOR

Waterdeep's laws are extensive and complex, meaning that most folk who tangle with them are soon lost at sea. Solicitors act as pilots through the troubled waters, providing legal advice and court representation for relatively little cost.
As the characters move through the ward, a solicitor approaches them and offers their services for the paltry sum of 2 gp per day. If the group hires the solicitor, they gain advantage on ability checks made to deal with the authorities or guilds within Waterdeep.

## Strange Feelings

The characters get a strange feeling they're being followed. Roll a d4 to determine who's on their tail.

1. Four thugs see the group as an easy mark, waiting for the right opportunity to attack. They spread out and try to ambush the group from in front and behind.
2. Two veteran City Watch officers have been tailing the group to ensure that they're not troublemakers. They approach to question the characters about their business in the city.
3. A young boy named Nihl is shadowing the group, hoping to see them do something heroic. His stealth is poor, and he comes clean about his intent if the characters confront him.

# Waterdeep Rumors 

d20 Rumor
1 My sister's cousin on the City Watch says there've been several vampire sightings of late. Waterdeep ain't had trouble with bloodsuckers for centuries!
2 You know there are treasure maps everywhere nowadays? Can't say what it's all about, but if you ask me, someone's trying to distract folks from noticing something.
3 Volo is back in town! Working on a new book about taverns I hear. Last I saw him, he was drinking his way through the Dock Ward sampling the local brews.
4 Word on the streets says that someone's been stockpiling smokepowder. There's no good reason for that.
5 Justyn from the Guild of Butchers grew up in Field Ward and has dreams of a fancy home. If you want to make a friend of him, pass him a few extra coins.
6 They say that Trollskull Manor, that old tavern off Trollskull Alley, is haunted by the ghost of the half-elf bartender Lif, who literally worked himself to death. I'd stay away if I were you.
7 There's been a lot more drow in the city of late. It's good to see the dark elves overcoming their evil history and becoming contributing citizens. Anyone can make a new life in the City of Splendors!
8 Last night I heard a strange clanking inside the House of the Inspired Hands in the Sea Ward. It was like someone wearing plate armor dancing a jig.
9 Are you in great need? Local thugs threatening your family? If you need help, and if you can find him, you might be able to convince the monk Hlam to aid you. They say he's the Grandmaster of the Order of the Even-Handed, a group devoted to the returned god Tyr. He's been known to aid those in great peril.
10 Lots of the Black Network in town. I hear there's a split between the Zhents who follow Pereghost and some new upstart claiming to be Manshoon. Not possible of course, since Manshoon is dead. Again.
11 The ghost of the Black Viper is back from the dead! A century ago that burglar and assassin plagued this city, and now they've returned with flair!
12 I hear that one of the Masked Lords is a vampire! Do you think it could be true? If it were, who knows what tax they might demand.
13 Looking for potions, poultices, or philters? Try Fala Lefaliir who operates an herbalist's shop on Trollskull Alley called Corellon's Crown.
14 Most of the City Watch is corrupt. They don't care about the people, only lining their pockets. They'll hassle you for no good reason, but at least you can bribe your way out of most problems with a few Dragons.
15 There's a sea monster haunting Deepwater Harbor! Fishermen coming in late have spotted a huge shiny creature with massive claws and evil glowing eyes swimming through the harbor and out to sea. I'd steer clear of the water if I were you.
16 Something's not right with that halfling hostel on Spices Street. Its well-kept, but the place is overrun by rats. They've got to be getting in through a tunnel from the sewers.
17 One of the Guilds has been infiltrated by dopplegangers, but no one knows which one. I'm betting on the Fellowship of Innkeepers. It just makes sense: lots of gossip and spying opportunities, and if someone goes missing, no one will notice.
18 The Blackstaff has gone wonky and you can't trust her. Rumors say she's started hunting down members of her own Force Grey. Think twice if she offers you a job.
19 You noticed the odd weather of late? I bet it's a sign. I was talking to my greengrocer yesterday and he told me that he heard from the fishmonger that the Sea Ward is rife with devil worshippers!
20 A light has been seen in Ahghairon's Tower the last three nights. It's been magically sealed for centuries, and not even the Blackstaff has ever gained entry. No one could have gotten inside, could they?
4. A nervous servant is scoping out adventurers to aid his master. He says that strange occurrences are happening in the family's crypt in the City of the Dead. If the characters investigate, they discover that the crypt is haunted by a specter.

## Street Performer

The characters encounter a street performer. If the characters join the crowd of onlookers, they have a $50 \%$ chance of triggering the "Pickpocket" encounter.
Roll a d 4 to determine the nature of the act:

1. A man dressed in brightly colored clothing spins plates on a series of poles. His balance and skill impress the small crowd gathered around him.
2. A female halfling in leather armor juggles knives, daggers, and shortswords. A volunteer from the audience tosses vegetables into the spinning mass, which the juggler slices in half with her weapons.
3. An elf recites an epic poem about the construction of Waterdeep. His audience consists mostly of older aged men and woman, who occasionally shout corrections to the poor orator.
4. A trio of minstrels play to a crowd that is clapping along and dancing.

![img-6.jpeg](assets/Waterdeep%20City%20Encounters_img-6.jpeg)

## Street Race

A grand race moves through the city's wards, with competitors eager to win glory for their ward by crossing the finish line first. The route is marked with pennants, burning torches, or string bunting. While the race is held, the crowded, noisy streets count as difficult terrain and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight or sound are made with disadvantage.
Characters who wish to compete in the race must sign up to one of the ward teams and then purchase a racing uniform in their colors for 3 gp . To determine a winner, use the chase rules and Urban Chases Complications in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master's Guide.
Roll a d6 to determine the format of this race:

1. Runners on foot.
2. Horse-drawn chariots.
3. Piggy-back teams.
4. Griffon riders (must stay below rooftop height).
5. Horse riders.
6. Boxcarts.

## Street Food Vendor

A tinkling bell announces a man pushing a cart of grilled fish kebabs which he claims were caught this morning. Gerdon, the vendor, hears and sees a lot as he wanders the streets and can share a wealth of stories so long as the characters purchase a kebab from him for 2 cp . If you have a specific rumor to plant, Gerdon is a perfect source. Alternatively, roll on the Waterdeep Rumors table to find out what he has to say.

## StUMbling Figure

A pedestrian stumbles into the one of the characters. Roll a d6 to determine why they fell.

1. The elderly woman tripped on a stone and has dropped a bundle of rags. Inside is a freshly severed human hand wearing a ruby ring worth 50 gp .
2. The young woman is a spy for the Masked Lords and is being followed by two doppelgangers. Not sure whom to trust, she slips vital information about a plot against the city into the character's hand.
3. The halfling street performer is trialing a physical comedy routine where he keeps bumping into people.
4. The young woman distracts the group while her husband tries to pick the pocket of one of the characters. Both are bandits.
5. The young man is running from a giant spider that has crawled up from the sewers.
6. The woman is a female flumph disguised in an overly large coat and a wig, so she can blend in while sightseeing.

## Supernatural Mists

Clammy and impenetrable mists envelope the characters. Though the sounds of the city can still be heard, they are muffled, muted, and seem to be far, far away. The characters get the impression that they're being followed: the snap of a twig here, the scuff of a boot on stone there, but investigating the noises reveals nothing. For the better part of an hour, the group can wander in whichever direction they choose, but encounter nothing but the mist. After this time, the mists fade and the characters find themselves exactly where they were when they first appeared.

## Tax Collectors

Four veteran City Guards on horseback escort an armored carriage through the ward. Inside the carriage, a noble tax collector clutches a steel strongbox containing the ward's taxes. The strongbox contains $2 \mathrm{~d} 6 \times 100 \mathrm{gp}$, and anyone caught pilfering is sentenced to a year's hard labor under section II of the Code Legal.

## Traffic Warden

A uniformed member of the City Watch uses hand flags to direct traffic at this busy intersection. Characters who pass by must succeed on a DC 10 group Wisdom (Perception) check to read the traffic warden's signals correctly and avoid accident. If they fail, roll a d4 to determine what happens:

1. A double-decker dray carriage thunders into the group. Each character must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or take 11 (2d10) bludgeoning damage.
2. The traffic warden yells at the characters for stepping in front of traffic and levies a spot fine of 1 gp per person.
3. A carriage driver snaps his horse whip at a randomlydetermined character as he clatters past: +3 to hit, 1 (1d3) slashing damage.
4. Swerving to avoid the characters, a carriage crashes into goods wagon and scatters its cargo over the street. Roll on the Random Goods table to determine the cargo.

---

## Undercover City Watch

An undercover spy for the City Watch tails the group through the ward. For each hour that passes, roll the spy's Stealth versus the passive Perception of the most observant character in the group. If the check fails, the characters notice the tail. The spy is checking to see if the group is up to no good. If they leave the ward without causing trouble, the spy gives up following them.

## Unearthed Evil

A priest of Jergal has unearthed an evil artifact from the City of the Dead, and it's causing strange things to happen across the ward (for further details, see location 12, "House of Headstones," in the "Location Encounters" section).
Roll a d4 to find out how the weirdness manifests:

1. 1 d 6 skeletons and 1 d 3 zombies burrow out of their graves and wander aimlessly around the graveyard.
2. The characters get an odd feeling, as though someone walked over their graves. That night they are haunted by dreams of a strange, green stone.
3. Thousands of crows and carrion birds circle the City of the Dead, covering everything below in their droppings.
4. An unusual rain storm unleashes inches of oily water over the City of Dead in just a few minutes. For the next 24 hours, characters caught in the downpour find themselves glimpsing ghostly figures that no one else can see.

## Unholy Invitation

A messenger approaches the characters with an invitation from Willifort Crowelle to take a tour of the Cassalanter Villa (see chapter 6, "Hell of a Summer," in Waterdeep: Dragon Heist). If they accept, Willifort - a doppelganger in the guise of an aging tiefling - gives them a tour, reading their thoughts to see if they'd make good agents for the Cassalanters. If he finds that the characters know about the Stone of Golorr, he keeps the tour going for as long as possible, so he can learn everything they know. If you reroll this encounter at a later date, the characters are invited to the villa again, this time to dine with Victoro and Ammalia Cassalanter.

## WANTED GrIMINAL

The characters pass a wanted criminal on the street. Anyone with a passive Perception of 14 or higher recognizes the criminal from a wanted poster. Roll a d4 to determine the criminal:

1. An assassin wanted dead or alive for multiple murders, with a reward of 100 gp paid on delivery to the City Watch.
2. A Zhent enchanter (see appendix 2) in service to Manshoon who uses mind control to force innocent people into committing crimes for the Black Network. She's wanted alive for questioning, earning 50 gp for anyone bringing her in.
3. A swashbuckler (see appendix 2) whose dalliances with the spouse of a wealthy merchant led to a bounty. The merchant pays 300 gp for the adulterer to be brought alive to a warehouse for "questioning."
4. An innocent werebear framed for murder by the Xanathar Guild. He's wanted alive for questioning by the City Watch with a reward of 200 gp .

## Wild Animal

The characters encounter an animal that's escaped from captivity. A successful DC 12 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check calms the beast so it doesn't cause any harm. However, the DC increases by 1 each round as more people gather to witness the disturbance, risking the animal becoming spooked.
Roll a d6 to determine which animal has escaped:

1. Ape
2. Black Bear
3. Allosaurus
4. Elephant
5. Giant Boar
6. Lion

# Part Two: Location EngOUNTERS 

HE ENCOUNTERS BELOW INTRODUCE complications at specific locations within Waterdeep. Use them when your group visits one of the locations numbered on the Waterdeep: City Encounters map or passes nearby while travelling through the city.

## Castle Ward Locations

"You want bilge-water, go drink in the Dock Ward. We've got class up here in the Castle."

- Durnan, Proprietor of the Yawning Portal.

The Castle Ward is the governmental heart of Waterdeep, encompassing the city's courts and municipal halls. Castle Waterdeep overlooks the ward from a rocky bluff at its southern end.

## 1. Blackstaff Tower

This tower is home to Blackstaff Academy, a school for mages run by the current Blackstaff, Vajra Safahr.
When the characters arrive, two bandit captains named Stowe and Barrell are questioning an apprentice wizard (see appendix 2) named Rollina Metrel outside the tower's entrance. The pair have been hired by the assassin Clevey Sandster to distract Rollina while Clevey aims a crossbow at her from the corner of an adjacent ally 80 feet away.
Clevey has been hired to murder Rollina and retrieve from her body an orb that the apprentice uses as a spell focus when performing magic. Clevey's employers, the

Cassalanter family, believe that the orb is magical and confers on its wielder a connection to the infernal magic of the underworlds.
While the orb is magical, it's not what anyone thinks. If the person attuned to the orb dies, it explodes in a flash of radiant energy, dealing 22 (4d10) radiant damage to all creatures within 10 feet of the orb.

## 2. Castle Waterdeep

This mighty fortress houses the garrison for the City Guard and serves as an impenetrable redoubt for the citizenry to retreat to in times of war.
The characters arrive just as an execution is about to take place. A small crowd has gathered before the gallows, with only the criminal's family (five commoners) and four City Watch (two guards and two veterans) in attendance. The guilty party is Asteppa Northmoss, a half-elf commoner, convicted of senselessly murdering two patrons at the tavern where she worked, in front of at least twenty witnesses.
As the characters pass the scene, a family member begs for their help, insisting that there must have been extenuating circumstances behind her murders. As the noose is tightened around Asteppa's neck, the ghost inhabiting her body takes possession of one of the guards, who sets to slaughtering everyone in attendance!
The ghost is the spirit of Agnes Trotter, a famous Waterdhavian murderess who poisoned customers at her bakery. Any character who sees the ghost in incorporeal form can attempt a DC 15 Intelligence (History) check to

---

recognize her. If Agnes is named aloud, she dissolves into nothingness. The characters, however, might have some explaining to do, especially if Agnes possessed one of them and forced them to attack an innocent.

## 3. FONT OF KNOWLEDGE

The Font of Knowledge is Waterdeep's temple to Oghma and its largest public library. If the characters delve into the lore contained therein, they discover the facts below in the order listed.

1. A record of property exchanges between Waterdhavian nobles, with each exchange happening as the result of the previous noble's death. On a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Insight) or Intelligence (Investigation) check, the characters realize that the names are merely anagrams of each other. These trades repeat every 40 years to the day and have been occurring for a little over 200 years. The record notes that the nobles are buried in the City of the Dead. If the characters enquire at the House of Headstones they can learn the plot (see location 12, the "House of Headstones.")
2. A map showing a series of chambers in Undermountain. One of the rooms has the phrase "Touch not the leftmost skull" scrawled across it in Dwarvish. Characters who've visited Undermountain recognize the rooms as being among those located near the well in the Yawning Portal.
3. A record of known and suspected Harper and Zhentarim agents active in Waterdeep, but the list is almost 50 years old. None of the names look familiar, save for one: Elminster. A note in the margin next to his name reads "Harper? Not a surprise".
4. A long list of Waterdhavian noble families who are rumored to have consorted with devils. House Cassalanter is chief among the most recent entries.

## 4. Halls of Justice

This temple to the god Tyr serves as the city's municipal court. Human priest Umfrey Lawgiver and his three acolytes are leaving the temple when they spot the group approaching. Believing that the characters have broken the Code Legal, Umfrey and his followers attempt to detain them. All the while, Umfrey screams out a litany of the characters' crimes, which he claims to have seen in a divine dream sent to him by the Even-Handed himself.
Umfrey and his acolytes avoid actual combat and flee inside the Halls of Justice if attacked. If the characters surrender, they're marched inside and tried before a court. The characters must succeed on a DC 12 group Charisma (Persuasion) check to avoid criminal charges.
Regardless of the outcome, Umfrey makes it his mission to tail the characters around the city. He can become a frequent annoyance as he shows up with his acolytes: organizing demonstrations against the characters, investigating their wrongdoings, and pointing them out to the City Watch whenever possible. Umfrey's disappearance would certainly draw suspicion on the characters, so they'd best make things right with him quickly or their enemies might just arrange his death to inconvenience them.

## 5. Mirt's Mansion

Famed adventurer and raconteur Mirt the Merciless has retired to Waterdeep to join the Masked Lords. His rambling mansion has seen better days but remains impressive in size and stature - much like the Old Wolf himself.
While passing Mirt's Mansion, the characters witness an odd occurrence. Four men and a halfling arrive to unload a wagonload of spirits, and after signing for the consignment, one of Mirt's servants helps three of the men roll the barrels into the cellar. While they're downstairs, the halfling pops the lid on a barrel and crawls inside while the fourth man seals him in and then rolls his barrel downstairs.
The four human bandits have been paid off by the halfling: a weretiger named Winfredd the Cat. Winfredd in turn has been hired by Jarlaxle Baenre to snoop about Mirt's home for any details he might have about the Stone of Golorr. Of course, once night falls and the household go to sleep, Winfredd plans to add some larceny to his snooping (for more details on Jarlaxle, see chapter 7, "Maestro's Fall" of Waterdeep: Dragon Heist).
If the characters foil the plot, they earn a favor from Mirt. He could introduce them to an important public figure, reveal a piece of choice gossip from the Waterdeep Rumors table, or even take the characters on a raucous night out on the town.

## 6. New Olamn's Academy of Music

The academy offers regular concerts, performances, rentable rehearsal spaces, and more. When the characters visit, choose an encounter that matches your chosen season:
Spring. A haunting fey-inspired string piece drifts through the academy. If tracked to its source, the instruments appear to be playing by themselves: in fact, the musicians are fairies resident in the feywild. Any character who hears the music gains the following flaw: "I can't help stop myself from tapping my toes and humming along whenever I hear music."
Summer. Four dwarves play jaunty tavern tunes. They wear tunics bearing the holy symbol of Hanseath - dwarven deity of festivity, brewing, and song - embroidered with their own names: Bhailee, Bharnum, Garriden, and Thaeldrun. A banner above them reads "Hanseath's Most Handsome". Any character who hears the dwarves play must succeed on a DC 12 Charisma saving throw or gain the following flaw: "I must have a frothy mug of ale every hour or else I become distracted." This effect lasts for a tenday or until dispelled by a remove curse spell.
Fall. A trio of Chultan musicians pluck at strangelooking stringed instruments while an aarakocra bangs on a leather-topped drum. Their entrancing rhythm sounds like a rainstorm and has a magical charm effect. Any character that hears the musicians must succeed on a DC 12 Charisma saving throw or become stunned for 2 d 4 minutes or until the musicians stop playing. Meanwhile, a Zhentarim spy sneaks through the entranced crowd (DC 16 passive Perception to spot) and steals 1d6 gp from each person.

---

Winter. A series of long, low tones emanate from a group of musicians playing brass wind instruments. Their notes are sonorous and resonate around the chamber; leaving those who hear the music with a feeling of cold dread and hollow loss. A nearby sign indicates that the musicians are practicing traditional Kelemvorite funeral dirges.

## 7. Palace of Waterdeep

The Palace of Waterdeep - as known as Piergeiron's Palace - is the lavishly decorated home of the ruler of Waterdeep. The palace contains many audience chambers and meeting halls for guild and city business.
When the characters arrive here, a carriage bearing the coat of arms of Neverwinter roars down the street and skids to a stop in front of the main gates. Characters in its path must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or be struck by the frothing horses, taking 14 (4d6) bludgeoning damage and falling prone. A young human scribe is bowled over by the carriage and falls to the floor unconscious and dying.
Girt the shield dwarf driver leaps down from his bench, hysterical with worry, while his ambassador passenger strides inside the palace on urgent business. Copies of the scribe's governmental documents - intended for the Open Lord's eyes only - flutter about on the breeze. This provides an excellent opportunity to draw the characters into city politics as they come into possession of documents they were never meant to see.

## 8. Spires of the Morning

The temple of Lathander is called the Spires of the Morning, as its seven tall, thin towers of copper, silver, and gold gleam in the morning sunshine.
As the characters are passing the temple, they witness acolyte Harber Boke struggle and then fall from the balcony of the tallest tower, screaming throughout his 100 -foot descent. If the adventurers save Harber or cast a speak with dead spell on his corpse, they learn that he was pushed by a cloaked female figure: elven by the look he got just before he fell.
The elf, Confor Teabough, a spy for Manshoon's sect of the Zhentarim, was attempting to steal some relics from the tower when Harber interrupted her. If the characters give chase, they can engage in a game of cat-and-mouse throughout the Spires of the Morning as they try to corner and capture the wily Confor before she escapes.

## 9. Temple of the Seldarine

This beautiful temple to the elven gods has spires that reach high above the surrounding rooftops. When the characters visit, a moon elf acolyte of Corellon Larethian named Amedee Liaxisys dashes into the temple's nave from the back rooms. She loudly proclaims that she's seen a ghost ascending the forbidden stairs from the crypts below!
Beneath the Temple of the Seldarine are crypts from the ancient elven city of Aelinthaldaar: the site on which Waterdeep was built, whose magic still protects the Waterdeep Plateau from ever collapsing. The acolytes are forbidden from entering the crypts and rumors of powerful wards and restless spirits abound among their ranks.

There is no ghost. A moon elf mage and follower of Erevan Ilesere named Sylmae Beifaren feels the young acolyte is too serious and is using her illusions to have a little fun at her expense. If the characters don't intervene, Amedee's haunt soon becomes the talk of the Castle Ward.

## 10. Yawning Portal Tavern

The Yawning Portal is famed for the open well in its taproom that plunges down into the dungeon of Undermountain! Retired adventurer Durnan runs the tavern, which is packed with adventurers drinking up courage for their own dungeon delves.
Approaching the tavern, a pair of veteran bodyguards summon the characters to a covered carriage parked on a nearby street. Inside, Durnan's old adventuring companion Mirt sits with a casket containing many potion bottles. He offers a potion of heroism to each character as an advance for helping him play a trick on his old friend Durnan. For more details on these two adventurers, see appendix B of Waterdeep: Dragon Heist.
Mirt wants the characters to get roaring drunk in the tavern and then descend into Undermountain. Durnan is sure to offer very low odds on them surviving, so he'll be surprised when they quaff their potions to counterattack their drunkenness and return with piles of riches! Mirt says he'll bet against them and split the pot with the group $50 / 50$ when they return.
Sadly, the joke is on the characters. "Mirt" is in fact a doppelganger working for the Xanathar Guild and the magic potions do nothing. Five of the Xanathar's bugbears wait at the bottom of the well to ambush the drunken explorers and rob them of their riches.

## City of the Dead Locations

"It's best that some things stay buried - or aren't buried to begin with."

- Sir Ambrose Everdawn, champion of Kelemvor

The City of the Dead is a sprawling cemetery on the eastern side of the city. Its manicured lawns, fine statuary, and picturesque woodlands make it more of a park than a graveyard.

## 11. Warrior's Monument

The lawns around this 60 -foot-high statue fountain are crowded with people. If the characters visit during the day, they find families having picnic lunches. At night, lovers meet for late-night trysts amid some of the most beautiful artwork in the city.
When the characters first visit the Warriors' Monument, the water pouring from the statue turns red as ogre blood, and some of the more monstrous portions of the statue come to life. The living statues wade into the crowd, slamming onlookers with fists and stone weapons. The monsters used can be adjusted based on the strength of the party: hobgoblins, orcs, trolls, and even human berserkers are represented in statue form as marauding invaders of the city.
Any character who tries to figure out how the statues came to life can attempt a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check as an action to discern an arcane

---

![img-8.jpeg](assets/Waterdeep%20City%20Encounters_img-8.jpeg)
rune etched on each statue that causes it to animate. As an action, a character can suppress a rune with a DC 18 Intelligence (Arcana) check. Characters who've previously met Luva Peersak at the House of Wonder (location 18) recognize the rune from her tablet.

## 12. House of Headstones

The House of Headstones is the local shrine to Jergal, god of undertakers and graveyard keepers. The shrine contains detailed but incomplete records of those buried in the City of the Dead.

While digging a grave, a priest of Jergal named Victus Payne recently unearthed a strange, geometric tablet made of sickly green stone, which he took back to his quarters in the House of Headstones. Each night, the stone radiates powerful necromantic magic that affects the City of the Dead (see the "Unearthed Evil" encounters in "Random City Encounters.")
As the characters pass by the shrine, they witness a young acolyte of Jergal named Ophemar Reil banging on the doors and calling out Victus's name. Victus has chosen to lock the shrine from within and refuses to allow anyone to disturb his studies. If the characters question Ophemar, they learn of Victus's odd behavior in recent days.
If confronted, Victus is unwilling to part with the tablet and lashes out violently if the characters use force to retrieve it. The evil of the tablet has warped him into a necromancer (see appendix 2).
Once Victus is dealt with, characters who've visited the Font of Knowledge in the Castle Ward (location 3) can enquire after the anagrammed nobles they found in the records. They discover that they are all buried in a nearby plot (see location 13, "Tombs of the Anagrammed Nobles.")

## 13. Tombs of the Anagrammed Nobles

Prerequisite: To play this encounter, the characters must visit the House of Headstones to learn the location of the plot.
The tombstones of five nobles stand adjacent to each other. The deceased were clearly wealthy and influential, judging by the materials used to craft their headstones. If the characters exhume the graves, they discover that each interned skeleton clutches a sliver of metal in its hand. If all five slivers are placed next to each other, they magically clip together to form a mystery key. The key is inscribed with the name "Caryn Jung Kiel" on one side, and the holy symbol of Tymora on the other.
If the graves are exhumed at night, removing the final fragment of the mystery key causes the bones in all five graves to animate as skeletons with the Lucky feat. Even if the bones are smashed before removing the fragment, they recombine and attack as soon as the final piece is disturbed. Dousing the skeletons with holy water before taking the fragment prevents this from happening.
Unless the characters take great care to hide their activities, a patrol of four veteran City Watch officers approaches them during the exhumation. Characters who lack the proper paperwork needed for exhuming bodies - available only to members of the Gravedigger's Union, clerics of Kelemvor, or by bribing a gravedigger with at least 5 gp - are arrested and charged with a tomb-robbing violation (article III of the Code Legal).

## Dock Ward Locations

"They say you're never more than five feet away from a rat in the Dock Ward. Right now, I'd say you're about five seconds away from getting bitten by one."

- Roscoe Underbough, wererat halfling

The steep, winding slums of the Dock Ward are home to the poor and the needy. Visitors to this ward are advised to return home before dark, lest they end up with a dirk between their shoulder blades.

---

## 14. Aurora's Realms Shop

Aurora was an adventurer sorceress who quested the globe before retiring to Westgate to found a lucrative business in exotic goods. Teleportation circles connected her Emporium to outlets across Faerûn, including this one in the Dock Ward of Waterdeep.
When the characters visit the shop, halfling shopkeeper Murianna Swindleheart casually tells them of a ship being held by the port authorities in the Great Harbor. The Merry Mermaid is carrying treasures from the Tomb of the Nine Gods in distant Chult, but the captain doesn't have proper paperwork to unload her cargo. Murianna hints that she'd pay a pretty penny to get her hands on those treasures.
If the character break onboard, use the sailing ship map from appendix C of the Dungeon Masters Guide to manage their progress. At night, the ship is defended by four veteran guards. The jungle curios stored in the hold are worth $1,000 \mathrm{gp}$ to a collector such as Murianna, but anyone venturing inside risks enraging the caged tyrannosaurus rex held within.

## Field Ward Locations

"And if you can't pay, I'll chop off your face and feed it to your friends. That's how we roll around here."

- Thrakkus, dragonborn butcher

The muddy ghettos at the north end of Waterdeep aren't considered part of the city proper, except to those who dwell in them. There's no law out here: the City Watch monitors the slums from the surrounding walls, but rarely ventures inside.

## 15. Endshift Tavern

This tavern is a popular drinking hole for off-duty members of the City Guard. As the characters enter, they hear cries of alarm. A crowd has gathered around teenager Kilar Tanwith, who is choking on a bite of his meat pie and turning blue in the face. A successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check prevents the boy from choking to death. If the characters save Kalir, he spits out a small bone, which a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Medicine) check identifies as part of a human finger.
If asked where he bought the pie, Kilar indicates a nearby food stall run by a market trader named Nellie Amoret. The purchase of a meat pie for 5 cp or a successful DC 12 Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) check gets Nellie to reveal she buys her ground meat from a dragonborn butcher named Thrakkus who lives in the Field Ward (see "Converted Windmill: Winter" in chapter 4, "Dragon Season," of Waterdeep: Dragon Heist).

## Sea Ward Locations

"Blue blood and brown earth, that's my family. I can trace my line through a hundred generations, but we still stink of the horse dung that built our fortunes."

- Teleos Eagleshield, Scion of House Eagleshield

The wealthy manors and boutique stores of the Sea Ward proudly exhibit where the old money resides in Waterdeep. Anyone who's anyone wants to live here: but not everyone can afford it.

## 16. Field of Triumph

The vendors outside the Field of Triumph enjoy a nearconstant footfall of customers, as the coliseum is an architectural wonder to behold. On days when gladiatorial battles take place, the vendors' carts and stalls crowd the street between the arena and the House of Heroes.
On this day, the Xanathar Guild is looking to stir trouble by rigging a sweetbread cart to explode amid the throngs of people gathered outside the coliseum. As the characters enter, a half-orc bandit named Gouge approaches them and warns them that one of the carts is going to explode very soon. Gouge is a member of the Xanathar Guild who recently grew a conscience. He knows that a cart is rigged but doesn't have any other details. The cart in question is operated by halfling vendor Doley Frufast.
The characters have just one minute to locate Doley's cart, which is trapped with the explosive runes version of the glyph of warning spell. The rune goes off when Doley opens a drawer in her cart to resupply. Characters who observe the crowd and succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom (Insight) check notice Doley suspiciously inspecting the strange mark on her cart a few rounds before the spell goes off.

## 17. House of Heroes

This grand sanctuary to Tempus is the largest temple in the city. Statues of Waterdhavian champions decorate its halls, from both military and ward competition backgrounds.
When the characters arrive, the temple priests are searching for a missing family who came here to pray for luck in the upcoming ward games. If the characters join the search, they notice that three of the statues are missing from their plinths: not entirely odd, as they could be in for repair.
Venturing into the crypts they discover that the three statues have come to life and are now beating up the missing father in front of his horrified family. Use the statistics of animated armor for the living statues. Any character who tries to figure out how the statues came to life can attempt a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check as an action to discern an arcane rune scratched on each statue that causes it to animate. As an action, a character can suppress a rune with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check. Characters who've previously met Luva Peersak at the House of Wonder (location 18) recognize the rune from her tablet.
If the characters rescue the family, the father reveals that the statues depict heroes from a rival ward. He says they came to life when they saw the ward colors he wears on his scarf.

## 18. House of Wonder

This glorious temple to the gods of magic is enhanced by illusions and magical displays. When the characters arrive, a mage named Luva Peersak is performing a presentation to a gathering of priests. Luva believes that any artistic rendition of an object or person absorbs a small part of its essence, which magicians can harness to bring it to life. A painting of an enemy, for example, could be interrogated as though it were the enemy themselves.

---

Her presentation is met with skepticism, and Luva swears that the priests will "learn the truth" of her words. As she angrily packs up her tablets, the characters catch a glimpse of the experimental runes she presented. Luva refuses to discuss her work with strangers.
If the characters encounter the living statues in location 11, the Warrior's Monument, or location 17, the House of Heroes, they may recognize Luva's runes. The mad mage has been etching runes into various statues around the city to prove her theories. If confronted with this, she attacks the characters to silence them about her crimes.

## 19. Sculpture Garden

Prerequisite: To play this encounter, the characters must recover the mystery key from the Tombs of the Anagrammed Nobles (location 13).
In the Castle Ward, there is a sculpture garden opposite the temple to Tymora. At the heart of the garden, a statue of a regal-looking halfling woman bears the inscription "Caryn Jung Kiel". If the inscription plate is removed, a keyhole is revealed beneath. The magic lock within can't be picked, nor can it be affected by the knock spell or similar magic.
If the characters determine that "Caryn Jung Kiel" is an anagram for "Lucky Jernigan", the statue animates, smiles at them, and rattles the nameplate. It then reverts to its normal position.
Inserting the mystery key into the keyhole causes the statue to animate. The halfling looks at the character that used the key and magically produces a set of playing cards. You can use your own cards to play a short game of blackjack or use a series of low-DC ability checks to simulate it. Should the characters win, the cards magically form into the deed for a wealthy Waterdhavian mansion. The first character to touch the deed finds that their name is listed upon its face.

## 20. Tower of Luck

The temple of Tymora sports a large dragonchess set in its courtyard, with each piece depicting the face of a priest of Tymora that previously held office. The characters can challenge each other or other passers-by to a game.
A five-foot marble post nearby sports the smiling face of a halfling woman, with an inscription underneath that reads "Lucky Jernigan. She loved to watch chess but lived for playing cards. Heep luvs Sozzled." If the players can't figure it out themselves, a DC 14 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals that 'heep luvs Sozzled' is an anagram of 'She loved puzzles'.
Anyone who deciphers the anagram or proves to be a good sport while playing dragonchess is given a blessing by the statue of Lucky Jernigan. Any character so blessed adds a d 4 to the next die roll they make for an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw. A character can receive this blessing only once.
The statue of Lucky Jernigan curses any character who cheats at dragonchess while in its sight. Any character so cursed subtracts a d 4 from the next die roll they make for an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw.

## 21. House of the Moon

As the characters gaze up at the temple of Selûne, they notice a griffon and its rider moving erratically in the sky. Griffon cavalry rider (see appendix 2) Kiri Xian is having
a bad first day on the job. She's lost control of Frigidbeak, her griffon mount, and is flying dangerously at a height of roughly 50 feet above the street. Any character that can get within 10 feet of the griffon, perhaps by climbing a nearby building with a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check, can calm Frigidbeak with a successful DC 13 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. The characters could also use magic, nets, or ropes to calm or restrain Frigidbeak and prevent disaster.
If the characters are unable to control the griffon within one minute of noticing it, Frigidbeak gets tangled in her harness and crashes to the ground below. One character on the ground, chosen randomly, must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 17 (5d6) bludgeoning damage as the griffon slams into them. Kiri and Frigidbeak also take this damage. After crashing, the temple acolytes can help Kiri restrain the griffon so she can get it under control.

## 22. House of Inspired Hands

The temple to Gond, god of craft and smithwork, is a working factory filled with experimental invention. When the characters first pass by the temple, they witness a group of five acolytes struggling to unload a huge crate from the rear of a goods wagon. Something inside the crate thumps about and roars in rage. Characters who offer to help the acolytes must succeed on a DC 12 group Strength (Athletics) check to maneuver the crate safely inside. If they fail, the crate falls to the floor and shatters, unleashing an angry gorgon onto the street.

## 23. Temple of Beauty

The marbled spas of the temple of Sune offer all manner of beauty treatments to visitors. When the characters first arrive, they learn that a young member of Sune's faithful has broken out in a terrible rash and is spreading rumors that they were caused by a jealous rival within the temple.
Characters who confront the rival clergyman and succeed on a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion, Deception, or Intimidation) check manage to goad a confession out of him.

## 24. Shrines of Nature

These beautiful garden shrines are tended by the worshipers of nature gods such as Mielikki and Silvanus. One of these groundskeepers, Skrewurl Yewheart, has recently disappeared, which is especially unusual given that he never leaves his shrine. When the characters arrive, the groundskeepers are dashing around in a panic trying to find Skrewurl.
If the characters search the gardens, they spot a parchment pinned to a tree by a bloody dagger, with a single copper coin lying on the ground below it. The unaddressed letter is signed with an "X" and speaks of a long-owed debt. Any character who succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence (History) check can assume that the letter was sent by the Xanathar. the beholder leader of the local Skullport thieves' guild.
If questioned, eye witnesses report that they saw a loutish-looking man flee into the rose garden, chased by four half-orcs. A search of the rose garden soon unearths the thug's body hurriedly hidden under a pile of leaves. He was fatally stabbed.

---

A thorough search of Skrewurl's quarters uncovers a letter from a local woman claiming to have birthed a child after a tryst with the missing cleric. Judging from the state of his chambers, Skrewurl left in a hurry.

## 25. Heroes' Garden

The statuary in this secluded garden depicts important figures from the city's history. Residents report strange sights in the garden at night: specifically, the ghostly apparition of a human mage. Those brave enough to confront the apparition were rebuked when it issued a "great shout" that sent them reeling!
The ghost is the spiritual manifestation of Ulthorn, a long-dead wizard whose tower once stood where the Heroes' Garden is today. Characters who approach the spirit peacefully are led to a plain patch of grass. Digging a foot down reveals a skeletal hand clutching a wand of pyrotechnics: Ulthorn's own wand. If the characters use the wand regularly to cause surprise, the ghost gradually fades away.

## North Ward Locations

"As has been said before, the people of Waterdeep are Waterdeep."

- Volothamp Geddarm, "Volo's Guide to Waterdeep"

The North Ward is home to most of the middle classes in the city. Its streets are quiet and peaceful, with frequent City Watch patrols.

## 26. Holyhands House

Holyhands House is a temple located in the former villa of House Maernos. When Ultas Maernos died without heirs, he left his lands to be used as temple grounds. His temple now has shrines for many different faiths, but halfling, dwarf, and gnome gods are particularly well represented.
When the characters arrive, a man standing in front of Holyhands House proudly proclaims that he is Urien Maernos, the grandson of Ultas Maernos. Any character who succeeds on a DC 17 Intelligence (History) check recalls that Ultas Maernos was a Waterdhavian nobleman who, after a life of debauchery and butchery, renounced his ways and lived the remainder of his years in pious reflection of his misdeeds. However, his wife and children were lost to a plague in Amn, leaving him with no heirs.
While the city initially dismissed Urien's claims, they've begun taking him more seriously since he's started disclosing facts about his grandfather that aren't so widely known. What's worse, some of the seedier elements of the ward are beginning to take notice: which may not bode well for the heir.

## 27. Hospice of St. LaupSENn

The faithful of Ilmater erected this hospice as a refuge for lepers, the poor, and the cursed. Charitable contributions and tithes from the Church of Tyr keep the hospice afloat, but money is always short.
Father Ozmir, an old priest of the hospice, has recently begun a secret fundraising operation: recruiting prior patients as thieves and muggers. Thanks to their
earnings, Ozmir has managed to keep the hospice afloat these past months and has even turned a tidy profit for a rainy day.
When the characters arrive, they witness a group of three thugs delivering a bag to Father Ozmir. As they hand it over, the bag splits and jewelry clatters onto the floor. If questioned, Father Ozmir explains the riches away as a donation from a wealthy lord.
Characters who watch the building see lowlifes coming and going at all hours to drop off their earnings to Father Ozmir. The characters also aren't the only ones spying: five bandits from the Shadow Thieves are watching the hospice, hoping to ascertain the size of Ozmir's operation.

## Southern Ward Locations

"I've been everywhere, man."

- Unnamed Calishite stall owner, Southern Ward

The Southern Ward is home to folk who traveled here from other lands to stake their claim in the North. Its maze-like streets are a riot of rich colors, smells, and magnificent sights.

## 28. Helm's Hall

This shrine to the god of guardians and protectors serves as an orphanage for the poor and needy.
Today, the orphans have taken over the orphanage to celebrate Children's Day. For one day each year, they can dress in adults' clothing and boss their elders about without fear of retribution. Something very odd has happened this year: the adults have all disappeared! Nobody saw them leave, and their clothes lie in heaps where they last stood.
The children have formed a monarchy around Little Kaz, the youngest and smallest of their number. Anybody who wishes to speak with the priests must first seek an audience with Queen Kaz. Her majesty allows them to search the building but insists that they don't enter one of the bedrooms. If anyone touches the sinister mirror inside this room, they hear distant cries for help from beyond the pane.
If the characters question the other orphans about the room, they eventually learn that Kaz bought a wish from the "lady in the mirror", which she used to make Children's Day last for a whole year. As payment for the deal, she permitted the night hag living inside the mirror to kidnap the adults for a year. To free the adults, the characters must cut their own deal with the hag.

## 29. Jade DANGER

This festhall takes its name from the eight-foot-tall jade statue of a woman that magically animates to entertain the patrons. When the group visits, one of the characters is snatched away by the dancer and made to dance a waltz around the festhall.
At the end of the dance, the jade dancer leans closer and whispers the word "Taacoro" into its partner's ear. Almost at once, patrons loyal to the four villainous factions attempt to find out what the characters heard by any means necessary: these include a drow from the Bregan D'aerthe, a pair of half-orc berserkers from the Xanathar Guild, a spy for House Cassalanter, and a pair of bandits loyal to Manshoon's Zhentarim.

---

Each group has staked out the festhall on the suspicion that the dancer knows something about the location of the Stone of Golorr. Whether it does or not is entirely up to you.

# Trades Ward Locations 

"Money, my duck! You can fluff up those feathers all you like, but you won't sit on the king's table if you've got no dough."

- Mirt the Moneylender

The bustling stalls and shopfronts of the Trades Ward are the mercantile hub of the North. Everything is available here for a price, if you know where to look.

## 30. House of Light

The hall of the Guild of Chandlers and Lamplighters is noted for the mountainous heap of waxed candles that is kept lit outside the building at all hours.
Down-on-his-luck candlemaker Ivar Roamswell recently fell on hard times and petitioned his guild for aid. Unfortunately, his pleas fell on deaf ears. He's returned with a dagger and two vials of poison to exact his revenge on the official who dismissed him. Ivar plans to poison his dagger with one of the vials and down the contents of the second after he slides the blade between the official's ribs. The characters happen upon him applying the poison in a side alley outside of the guildhall.
A successful DC 17 Charisma (Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion) check talks Ivar down from his crime, but unless he's arrested, the Waterdeep Wazoo newssheet reveals that he accomplishes the deed anyway two days later. If the characters prevent the crime entirely, Ivar contacts them daily to pester them with philosophical questions and share his latest conspiracy theories.

## 31. Court of the White Bull

This courtyard is the site of a spell battle that tore a hole in the Weave, causing magic to behave peculiarly. To this day, spellcasting is forbidden within the perimeter of the square.
When the characters arrive, they spot three wizard's familiars perched on nearby fountain: a cat, a rat, and a toad. The familiars are arguing in the Celestial language and trying to cast spells with their paws. The trio meet up while their masters are sleeping and seek to break the magical hold they have over them.
Unless the characters intervene, the familiars' crude attempt at magic has unpredictable results. Roll once on the Sorcerer's Wild Magic table to determine what happens.

# Appendix 1. Waterdeep Weather 

The City of Splendors enjoys milder weather than the norm due to unusually warm ocean currents and shelter from northern storms by Mount Waterdeep. Despite these advantages, strong westerly winds often beset the city, making it a damp and misty place.

## Random Weather Tables

While some encounters require specific weather conditions as part of their story, the weather is frequently overlooked. Use this appendix to generate random weather effects to give life to your encounters. Based on the season, roll a d20 to determine the current weather. All temperatures are given in Fahrenheit.

## Winter

Winters in Waterdeep often range from 0 to 45 degrees and snow is not uncommon. The warm westerly winds frequently lead to melting snow which only adds to foggy conditions. Snow from bitter northern winds is generally preferred by most locals, as a frozen road is easier to traverse than a muddy one.

## Weather Effects

Each result on the Random Weather Tables possesses one or more of the following weather effects.
Cold. The temperature ranges between 0 and 32 degrees. This functions as Extreme Cold from Chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide, except the saving throw is made with advantage.

Extreme Cold. This functions as Extreme Cold from Chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide.
Hail. Hailstones plummet from the sky, causing disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing. Creatures caught without shelter for ten minutes or more must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or suffer 1d3 bludgeoning damage.
Heavy Fog. A blanket of heavy fog makes it impossible to see across the street. The entire area is heavily obscured, and creatures suffer from the blindness condition when attempting to see anything beyond five feet of them.
Heavy Rain or Snow. As Heavy Precipitation from Chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide. If it has been snowing for an hour or more, exterior locations in the city count as difficult terrain.
Hot. The temperature ranges between 85 and 100 degrees. Characters without shelter or water suffer effects as per Extreme Heat from Chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide, except their saving throws are made with advantage.
Ice. As Slippery Ice from Chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide.
Light Fog. A light fog lightly obscures the area, causing Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight to be made with disadvantage.
Lightning. Extreme weather has generated perfect conditions for lightning strikes. For every ten minutes that a creature spends in the open, it has a cumulative $2 \%$ chance of being caught in a lightning strike. A creature struck by lightning must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, suffering 18 (4d8) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Characters wearing metal armor or in high places such as roof or treetops suffer disadvantage on this saving throw.
Light Rain or Snow. A steady light precipitation covers the area, providing disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. Light rain has a $50 \%$ chance per hour of extinguishing an open flame.
Strong Wind. As Strong Wind from Chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide.
Windy. Howling winds gust through the streets, providing disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing. Open flames have a $50 \%$ chance of being extinguished for every 10 minutes they're exposed to the wind, and fog effects are automatically dispersed.
