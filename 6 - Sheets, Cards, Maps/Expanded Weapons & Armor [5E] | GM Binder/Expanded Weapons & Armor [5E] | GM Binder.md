# Armor Properties

The armor table shows the cost, weight, and other properties of the common types of armor worn in the worlds of D\&D. Adamantine. An adamantine suit of armor is reinforced with adamantine, one of the hardest substances in existence. The adamantine version of an armor costs 10000 gp more than the normal version. While you're wearing it, any critical hit against you becomes a normal hit. Armor Class (AC). Armor protects its wearer from attacks. The armor (and shield) you wear determines your base Armor Class. Armor Proficiency. If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can't cast spells. You cannot be disarmed of your armor. Damage. A creature wearing spiked armor of any variant or wielding a shield can use a bonus action to make one melee weapon attack with the armor spikes or shield at a target within 5 feet of it, and at the start of each of their turns, they can deal damage while wearing spiked armor to one creature grappled by them with the armor spikes. The damage equals the damage die in the damage column, and you use your Strength modifier for the attack and damage rolls. Mithril. Mithral is a light, flexible metal. A mithral chain shirt or breastplate can be worn under normal clothes. The mithril version of an armor costs 1000 gp more than the normal version. If the armor normally imposes disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks or has a Strength requirement, the mithral version of the armor doesn't. Shields. A shield is made from wood or metal and is carried in one hand. Wielding a shield increases your Armor Class by the amount stated in the armor class column. You can only gain the armor class increase from one shield at a time. If your character starts with a shield, that shield is a round shield. Stealth. If the Armor table shows "Disadvantage" in the Stealth column, the wearer has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. Strength. Armor can interfere with the wearer's ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely. If the strength score is less than the score in the Strength column for an armor type, the armor reduces the wearer's speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score. Battlerager. The battlerager barbarian can use all spiked armor variants for its class features, and can rage while wearing heavy armor, ignoring the restriction. The damage for all of its subclass features is reflected in the damage column of the respective armor types, replacing the damage the features normally deal.

## Improved Weapons

Sometimes characters don't have their weapons and have to attack with whatever is at hand. An improvised weapon includes any object you can wield in one or two hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a frying pan, a wagon wheel, or a dead goblin. Often, an improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be treated as such. For example, a table leg is akin to a club. At the DM's option, a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it were that weapon and use his or her proficiency bonus.
An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4 damage (the DM assigns a damage type appropriate to the object). If a character uses a ranged weapon to make a melee attack, or throws a melee weapon that does not have the thrown property, it also deals 1d4 damage. An improvised thrown weapon has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.

## Special Weapons

Weapons with special rules are described here.
Bowblade. The bowblade can be transformed into a scimitar or back again as a bonus action.
Harpoon. When you score a hit with a thrown ranged attack with the Harpoon against a Huge creature or smaller, the target cannot move further than 30 feet away from you as long as you hold the rope or tie it to an immovable object. They can free themselves with a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check to rip the rope or use their action to pull out the harpoon, dealing 1d6 piercing damage to themselves unless they succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check to pull it out safely.
Net. A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 20 slashing damage to the net (AC 20) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net. When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, you can make only one attack with the net regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.
Quadflail. When you hit an attack with this flail, roll a d4. The number rolled determines how many heads will hit the target. You roll the damage die and add your ability modifier as well as any other modifiers a number of times equal to the number rolled on the d4.
Whipblade. When you make a thrown ranged attack with the Whipblade, the blade gets pulled back into your hand as part of the attack.

## Uncommon Weapons

Adamantine. An adamantine weapon or piece of ammunition overcomes resistance and immunity to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing or slashing damage that isn't adamantine. Any hit made with an adamantine weapon against an object is a critical hit, and adamantine armor is treated as normal armor. The adamantine version of a melee weapon or of ten pieces of ammunition costs $\mathbf{5 0 0} \mathbf{g p}$ more than the normal version, whether the weapon or ammunition is made of the metal or coated with it.
Advanced. Advanced weapons are difficult to master, and as a result require more specialised training than even martial weapons. Characters gain proficiency in Advanced Weapons when they have proficiency in all Martial Weapons. If a character gains proficiency in Martial Weapons at a later level, then they also gain proficiency in Advanced Weapons. If you gain the Weapon Master feat, you can also choose an advanced weapon as one of the weapon proficiencies you gain.

---

Firearms. In some worlds, firearms are common and widespread among those unaffine to magic. As an optional rule, they cost $1 / 100$ th of their cost in their respective table and deal an additional damage die instead of adding your ability modifier to the damage rolls. If you gain the Gunner feat, you also gain proficiency in the advanced ranged weapons, and when you use the Attack action and attack with a one-handed weapon with this feat, you can use a bonus action to attack with a blackpowder pistol you are holding.
Silver. A silvered weapon or piece of ammunition overcomes resistance and immunity to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing or slashing damage that isn't silvered. The silver version of a melee weapon or of ten pieces of ammunition costs 100 gp more than the normal version, whether the weapon or ammunition is made of the metal or coated with it.

# Weapon Properties 

Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Weapons tables.
Armor Piercing (E). You have advantage on attack rolls with an Armor Piercing weapon or ammunition when attacking a creature that has an AC of 20 or higher.
Blessed (E). When a creature is hit with a Blessed weapon or ammunition, the target cannot take reactions until the end of their next turn.
Blinding (E). When a creature is hit with a Blinding weapon or ammunition, the target is affected by the blinded condition until the end of their next turn.
Disabling (E). When a creature is hit with a Disabling weapon or ammunition, the target's speed is reduced by 10 feet until the end of their next turn.
Distracting (E). When a creature is hit with a Distracting weapon or ammunition, the next saving throw the target makes before the end of the wielder's next turn is made with disadvantage.
Elemental (E). When you hit a creature with an Elemental weapon or ammunition, the target takes an additional 2d4 of one of the following damage types (chosen when gaining this property): acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison or thunder.
Exotic (E). When you hit a creature with an Exotic weapon or ammunition, the target takes an additional 1d8 of one of the following damage types (chosen when gaining this property): force, necrotic, psychic, or radiant.
Glowing (E). As a bonus action on your turn, you can have your Glowing weapon or ammunition shed bright light in a 30 foot radius, and dim light for an additional 30 feet. You can deactivate this effect with another bonus action on your turn.
Slaying (E).

Switching (E). When you hit a creature with an Switching weapon or ammunition, you can use a bonus action immediately afterwards to switch places with the target.
Adaptable. When you make an opportunity attack with this weapon, you have advantage on the attack roll.
Agile. When making an attack with an agile weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls when you wield the weapon in two hands. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.
Ammunition. You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon).
At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield. If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used this way.
Blackpowder. When fired, Blackpowder weapons emit a deafening crack audible 300 feet away. If a Blackpowder weapon is exposed to heavy rain, submerged, or drenched in water by a similar means, then it cannot fire. A character cannot use this weapon again until they complete a short rest in dry conditions. Blackpowder bullets and grenades are destroyed after being used.
Bludgeon. If you make an attack with this weapon and score a critical hit against a creature wearing armor, you can roll one additional damage die when determining the extra damage it takes.
Brawler. If you attack with this weapon as part of the attack action on your turn, you can use a bonus action immediately after to shove or grapple your opponent.
Brutal. When you score a critical hit against a creature with a Brutal weapon, you can add an additional weapon damage die to the damage dealt.
Bulky. When using this weapon to attack a target within 10 feet, you have disadvantage on the attack roll.
Bypass. When you attack a creature wielding a shield with a bypassing weapon, you can ignore the bonus to its AC from its shield.
Covert. If you are hidden, a missed attack with a covert weapon does not reveal you.
Cumbersome. When making an attack with a cumbersome weapon, you must use your Strength modifier for both the attack and damage rolls.
Defensive. While you are wielding a defensive weapon and no tower shield, you gain a +1 bonus to your AC. You can add this bonus only once.

---

Disarm. You can use the Attack action to make a special melee attack with a disarm weapon, a disarming attack. If you're able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them. The target of your disarming attack must be no larger than one size larger than you and must be within range if your weapon.
Make an attack roll contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) check or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If you win the contest, the attack causes no damage or other ill effect, but its weapon lands in an unoccupied square within 10 feet of it. You have disadvantage on the attack roll if the target is holding the item with two or more hands. The target has advantage on its ability check if it is larger than you, or disadvantage if it is smaller.
Drag. You can use the attack action to make a special melee or ranged attack with a dragging weapon, a dragging attack. If you're able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them. The target of your dragging attack must be no larger than one size larger than you and must be within range of your weapon. Make an attack roll contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) check or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If you win the contest, the attack causes no damage or other ill effect, but the target gets pulled up to 10 feet in a direction of your choice.
Execute. If you make an attack with an executing weapon and score a hit against an incapacitated, paralyzed, restrained, surprised or unconscious creature, you can roll one additional damage die when determining the damage it takes.
Finesse. When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.
Flexible. When you take the Attack action and attack with a flexible weapon, you can use a bonus action to make another attack, dealing bludgeoning, piercing or slashing damage (your choice) equal to the value in parentheses, on the property description.
Glove. A glove weapon is worn on your hand or forearm, and you cannot be disarmed of it. You can hold objects, wield weapons, and cast spells with a hand fitted with a glove weapon, but you can only attack with the glove weapon if that hand is unoccupied. It takes an action to don or doff a glove weapon.
Heavy. Small or Tiny creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. Small and Tiny creatures may craft versions of these weapons that are more suited to them, with the size of all damage dice reduced by one die size (3d4/2d6/1d12 -> 1d10 -> 2d4/1d8 -> 1d6 -> 1d4 -> 1d1).
Hidden. Your weapon is hidden inside a boot, gauntlet, sleeve, staff, hat, cane or another possible location on your person and can be pulled out, ejected via a mechanism or reinserted as a bonus action. The weapon remains hidden unless a creature succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence (investigation) check to search you.

Scatter. When you take the attack action and successfully hit a creature with a scattering weapon, measure the weapon's Scatter range from the square (or point of impact) that the target you hit occupies. All creatures other than the original target that fall within the weapon's scatter range must make a Dexterity saving throw against your Scatter DC. Upon a failed save, they take damage equal to 2d6 of the same type as the weapon that you hit with.

A weapon's Scatter range and shape are mentioned in its statistics. For example, a Flame Bellows has a range of 15 feet and a Scatter range of 15 feet. This means the weapon can hit a target within 15 feet, and upon a hit, a 15 -foot cone extending beyond the target will determine those hit by the Scatter effect, up to a total distance of 30 feet.

Scatter Save DC $=8+$ your proficiency bonus + the ability score modifier that you use to determine damage for this weapon.

Special. A weapon with the special property has unusual rules governing its use, explained in the weapon's description (see "Special weapons" earlier in this section).

Swift. When you miss an attack with a swift weapon, you gain advantage on the next attack roll you make with that weapon against the same target.

Thrown. If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon.

For example, if you throw a hand axe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.

Two-Handed. This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.
Unwieldy. Due to being incredibly oversized, having an awkward shape, or any other number of ergonomic problems, swinging or firing this weapon is an incredible commitment. You cannot attack more than once in a single turn with this weapon, regardless of how many attacks you could normally make, unless your strength score equals 24 or higher.

Variable. A variable weapon is multifaceted and lets you use any part of it effectively to deal damage.
You can switch the damage type of the a variable weapon to bludgeoning, piercing or slashing damage (your choice) any time you attack with a variable weapon.

Versatile. This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

# Expanded Weapons \& Armor 

I started this project to expand on the 5 e weapons \& armor available in the Player's Handbook, as I found them too one-dimensional or stymied in progress in many cases, and the choice you made at character creation was often a given, if you didn't just flat-out ignored the mechanics for flavor, so this is supposed to help solve that problem without going too much into the level of depth that was normal in earlier editions while expanding on what already is there. The additional armors are also supposed to continue progress at higher levels, so that you still have something to work towards.

Thank you all once again for your input, and the time you took to analyse my homebrew, I appreciate it more than I can bring across in this comment. Feel free to use what you like, and leave out what you don't. I also don't mind if you want to use any of this in your own homebrew revamps. Enjoy the Expanded Weapons \& Armor [SE]!
