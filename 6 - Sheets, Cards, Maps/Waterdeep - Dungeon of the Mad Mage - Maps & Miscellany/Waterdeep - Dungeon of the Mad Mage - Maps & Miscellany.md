## ANARATH

Elder Rune of Protection and Sacrifice
Bane Effect: The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or it can't regain hit points until a remove curse or greater restoration spell is cast on it.

Boon Effect: The target is immune to the blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, and stunned conditions. In addition, the target stabilizes immediately when it drops to 0 hit points. This boon effect lasts for 24 hours.

## ANGRAS

Elder Rune of War
Bane Effect: The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or it gains vulnerability to all damage and a -2 penalty to death saving throws for 24 hours.

Boon Effect: When the target hits with an attack, the target can turn that hit into a critical hit, after which this boon effect ends.

## HAIaSTER

Elder Rune of the Mad Mage
Bane Effect: The target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 20d6 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Boon Effect: The target recovers its expended spell slots of 6th level and lower. If the target has no spell slots to recover, a magical shield surrounds the target for 1 hour instead. This shield grants the target resistance to all damage and can't be dispelled, though contact with an antimagic field destroys it.

## LOEBOS

Elder Rune of Fire
Bane Effect: The target must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d10 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful save.

Boon Effect: The target gains a pool of ten d6s. Up to two of these dice can be expended at a time and added to any damage roll the target makes when it hits with a weapon attack. The damage added by these dice is fire damage.

## LAMMATH

Elder Rune of Security
Bane Effect: For the next 24 hours, the target can't gain advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, or saving throws.

Boon Effect: Once within the next 24 hours, the target can use its reaction to reduce the damage it takes from one source by 10 d 6 .

## NCHASME

Elder Rune of Decision
Bane Effect: The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be incapacitated for 1 hour. While incapacitated in this way, the target gains the following personality flaw, which supersedes any opposing flaw: "I fundamentally disagree with everything anyone else says."

Boon Effect: The target can cast the augury spell as an action three times, requiring no components and with no chance of a random reading.

## SAVAROS

Elder Rune of Goblinkind
Bane Effect: All nonmagical coins and gems on the target's person vanish.

Boon Effect: The rune magically summons a goblin (use the goblin stat block in the Monster Manual), which appears in an unoccupied space within 20 feet of the target. The goblin is rude to everyone except the target and obeys the target's commands. The goblin vanishes in a puff of smoke if it drops to 0 hit points.

## ULLATHAR

Elder Rune of Passage
Bane Effect: The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be restrained for 24 hours.

Boon Effect: For the next 24 hours, the target gains the following benefits:

- The effects of the freedom of movement spell
- The ability to cast the knock spell at will, requiring no components

## Guild of Many Eyes

A thieves' guild that was driven from Waterdeep long ago still lurks in Undermountain, waiting and scheming to win back power in the city above. These villains make the sewers unsafe for honest folk to venture into. They have recently taken over Skullport, a subterranean town connected to Undermountain.

## InMORTAL Insanity

The Mad Mage of Undermountain has destroyed himself or been destroyed many times, but his demise is always short-lived. Folk say the dungeon cannot exist without him, and so it magically re-creates the archmage whenever he meets his end within its crumbling halls. Each time Halaster returns, less of his sanity remains.

## Skullport

Skullport overlooks the Sargauth River, a watery thoroughfare that cuts through the third level of Undermountain. Pirates once used the subterranean settlement as a trade port, but now it's a monster-infested haunt where spies and assassins hone their craft. Beware the fortress overlooking the river! Its garrison is commanded by an evil knight with a wyvern mount.

## TANGLED WEB

Secret temples exist in great numbers in Undermountain, particularly those of evil gods not welcomed in the city above. The vile servants of these deities are locked in an endless war for supremacy in the dark dungeon. Lolth, the Demon Queen of Spiders, is the fiendish mastermind behind many of these bloody conflicts.

## Arcturiadoom

One of Halaster's apprentices was a human transmuter named Arcturia, who created all manner of new monsters and often made herself the subject of her own horrid magical transformations. She claimed an entire level of Undermountain as her lair and polymorphed prisoners into monsters to guard it. It's likely that Arcturia resides in Undermountain still, in one form or another.

## What Drow Fear

Part of Undermountain was carved out by the drow. Muiral, said to be a former bodyguard and apprentice of Halaster's, claims this domain and hunts trespassers for sport. These halls are littered with the bones of the slaughtered. Even the dark elves speak of Muiral in hushed tones. Anyone who can terrify the drow should be avoided at all costs.

## Dwarfcraft

Much of Undermountain was built long ago by the shield dwarves of the Melairkyn clan. These dwarves were masters of stonework and hid many of their rooms behind secret doors. They also dug deep in search of precious metals. These mines were later stripped by duergar invaders, leaving a maze of worthless tunnels and caverns for monsters to inhabit.

## School of Magic

Rumor has it that a wizards' academy has opened on one of Undermountain's levels. It's not known who runs this academy-perhaps one of Halaster's apprentices or the Mad Mage himself-but many mages have been drawn down to it. What wizard wouldn't want to glimpse the powerful magic gathering dust in the depths of Undermountain?

## Mad House

The Shadowdusks were a Waterdavian noble family whose quest for political supremacy ended centuries ago after Shadowdusk wizards opened portals to the Far Realm. Twisted by madness and driven from their home, they sought assistance from Halaster and sank into the depths of Undermountain, never to be seen againyet vestiges of the noble house undoubtedly remain.

## Underground Forest

The River of the Depths connects the fourth and fifth levels of Undermountain, skirting the edges of vast caverns filled with trees, shrubs, birds, other animals, and sunlight. An entire forest, as real as any found on the surface, waits to be explored, but an archdruid protects it. And explorers traveling downriver have seen a huge green dragon as well, perched on a tower near a bridge that spans the river.

## Scavenger

The Sea of Swords has borne its share of pirate ships, none stranger than the Scavenger. This vessel could travel below the waves and through the air. No one has seen it in years. Perhaps it sank or was lost in the starry maelstrom of the night sky, but divination spells suggest it found its way into Undermountain. Others have searched for it below Waterdeep, but no one has found it and lived to tell the tale.

## TRObRIAND'S ARMY

Trobriand was one of Halaster's most promising and demented apprentices. Fascinated by machines, he carved out a level of the Mad Mage's dungeon for himself and set to work building an army of constructs there. It is said that Trobriand controls his creations with a metal ring, and that he crafted similar rings of lesser power for his apprentices, to protect them in the event that his constructs went insane.

## Death Tyrant

The Mad Mage has transformed an entire level of Undermountain into a proving ground for adventurers who seek to reach the deepest layers of the dungeon and the treasures hidden within. At the end of this underground obstacle course waits the greatest challenge of all: Netherskull the Death Tyrant, an undead beholder that hates wizards above all.

## Nester's Fate

Halaster brought seven apprentices with him to Undermountain. One of them, Nester, became a lich using spells and methods of his own devising. But his process was flawed, and over time Nester's phylactery and body disintegrated until only his floating skull and skeletal arms remained. Driven mad by his failure to achieve true lichdom, Nester continues to haunt Undermountain in this weakened form.

## Dark Elf Menace

Recent conflicts in Menzoberranzan have left weakened drow houses fearing for their future. Drow are coming to Undermountain in droves to carve out sanctuaries for one house or another. Halaster can't be happy to see them return in force, but who knows? Maybe the Mad Mage orchestrated the upheaval to bring the dark elves scurrying back for reasons beyond the comprehension of the sane.

## Emerald Blade

Waterdeep was erected atop the bones of a dwarven kingdom built on the dust of a much older elven kingdom. It is said that a relic of the elves still waits to be found in Undermountain: a magic sword so sharp that its edge can slice through stone. Many adventurers have vanished during their hunt for the weapon, which, it is said, the elves blessed with the heart of a warrior and the soul of a poet.

## Gith Who's Coming to Dinner?

Githyanki have invaded Undermountain. Perhaps they seek to destroy a mind flayer colony hidden in the depths of the dungeon, or perhaps they are planning to attack and plunder Waterdeep. There's one other possibility: the githyanki might be building a crÃ¨che-a stronghold away from the timeless Astral Plane where they can raise their young and train them in the art of war.

## Spire and Snail

Deep within Undermountain is a vast cavern containing a giant stalagmite that has been hollowed out to serve as a wizard's tower, perhaps even a refuge for the Mad Mage himself. The tower is guarded by stone constructs. No one knows what dwells inside. Not far from this tower lurks a most peculiar creature: a giant snail with a shell of pure gold.
