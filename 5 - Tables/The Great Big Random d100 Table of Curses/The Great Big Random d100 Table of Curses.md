Restoring the shrine would have been quick and easy, but she felt only greed. | Whenever your target's modified AC exceeds your modified attack roll by 5 or more, you can no longer hold the weapon that missed in the hand that you used. For magical weapons you can negate the effect by making an INT save of DC (12 + the number of weapons you can still use in any hand). For twohanded weapons, you first get disadvantage when attacking with it, and if the curse is invoked again, you cannot use it, both stages can be saved against if it's magical. To be able to use a weapon again, make a religion check with disadvantage during a long rest, or instead of a short rest. Pick a die with sides equal to or fewer than the result of your check. Roll it to determine how many weapons you can "forgive". Magical weapons cost double.
Clarification: Identical consumables like darts or throwing axes are considered one weapon by the curse. | When you make the religion check to regain use of weapons, if you cannot currently use any of the weapons you carry, take the result of your religion check against DC (25 - the number of weapons affected by the curse).

Some may be able to return from such a fate- others may find they no longer care. | Roll a d8 to determine which cursed Sin takes hold; 1 is Lust, 2 is Gluttony, 3 is Greed, 4 is Sloth, 5 is Wrath, 6 is Envy, and 7 is Pride. Exhibition of this particular Sin then supersedes other Personality Traits, Ideals, Bonds, and Flaws.

|  9 | Curse of Hom-
O-Nymphs | Nymphs, while not necessarily of cruel or wicked nature, are very alluring, such that one may become rather lost in their gaze towards them. As a result, the gazer may begin to act in rather odd stupors, slurring their words, saying the wrong things, and hearing the wrong things. As a means of punishing others for their braah actions and poor word choices in the name of love, they developed this curse. | Whenever a character does an action that could be misinterpreted as another action, at any time if applicable, roll a wisdom check to make sure you understood your own command to yourself; otherwise do an action that sounds the same. I.E.: Upon trying to lie someone, you might instead "Lie" on the floor when a bright light flashes and your eyes blink fast, you might instead accidentally cast the spell "Blink", or if you're trying to break something, instead have it come to halt by "braking" it, or maybe instead of knocking and "rapping" on a door, you begin rapping and spouting some sick rhymes. | Remove curse spell or taking a vow celibacy; if the vow of celibacy is broken, instead a wish spell is necessary to remove it and the curse returns. | Reddit User Stomo  |

She was accompanied by a boastful and proud gang of street thugs known only to history as the Crazy 88. On that same night a vengeful warrior came to slay the assassin for being an accomplice to the death of their unborn child. She effortlessly worked her way through the Crazy 88, rendering the once confident thugs as if they were blades of grass. And so, the Crazy 88 failed to stop the warrior killing the assassin. Unsatisfied with their unfulfilling deaths, the spirits of the Crazy 88 are sometimes reborn to solely attack those afflicted by the Curse of the Blue Leaves. Perhaps the Crazy 88 will slay their target and once again be cool. | Roll 22d4 to determine how many members of the Crazy 88 will attack the afflicted player.

Entropy | There once was a rogue who was offended by a wizard he knew. So to get back at him, he designed a curse that displaced his belongings. The displacement is subtle to have the afflicted think they were the one that put it there. | Every time the afflicted player goes to take a long rest, while they are asleep 1d4 of the player's belongings smaller than 1/8 cubic foot/2 lbs. get displaced by the curse. For each item, roll a d6. On a 1-3, the item changes place with another item of the player's belonging of similar size. On a 4-5 an item moves to an unoccupied place that would make sense for it to be closest to a location 2d10 feet in a random direction. On a 6, the item is transported 2d20 feet in a random direction. A successful DC 15 Wisdom check reveals the item was most definitely not placed there by the player.
