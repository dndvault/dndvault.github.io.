|  1 | Medusa's Kiss | Contact | Some know of the fabled Gorgon having the power to turn adventurers to stone by one look, but what they don't know is that this property is also obtained by harvesting the eyes of the creature itself. Merely making Contact with the fluids within the eyes will cause the same effect. This was first used by a Cult of a Gorgon in order to get revenge on the hero that slayed their patron. To this day that adventurer makes a fine addition to someone's garden estate. | DC 14 Constitution saving throw. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is instantly petrified. Otherwise, a creature that fails the save begins to turn to stone and is Restrained.

The petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the greater restoration spell, other magic, or once an hour passes. | 500 GP | Curt S.  |
|  2 | Cerberus | Ingested | The Cerberus poison is created from the blood of a devil, a demon, and a celestial being. This three ingredient combination creates a potentially lethal poison against outsiders and mortals as well. Luckily it is an ingested poison that when metabolized causes long term problems that could be lethal. | DC 17 Constitution saving throw. Failure causes internal bleeding that is painful and crippling. Any creature ingesting the poison and failing will lose 1d4 Constitution points and becomes fatigued within an hour. After 24 hours of that initial internal burn and bleeding the poison Continues to go through the body. Fatigue remains throughout the whole process until purged. The poison lasts 3 more days after this in which the DC goes up by 1 every 24 hours. If failed another 1d4 Constitution damage happens. Once one save is passed or 3 days from the initial saving throw pass the body purges it but the victim remains fatigued for 6 more hours. If the poison runs its course and does not bring Constitution to 0 the victim survives albeit hurt from the ordeal. A victim that reaches a score of 0 on Constitution dies of internal bleeding and organ failure. | 750 GP | Leo N.  |
|  3 | Dragon Farts | Inhaled | Despite what its name implies, the poison Dragon Farts is not created with Dragon farts at all. It is crafted from an extremely high density toxin created from the neck glands of a dragon where it draws its breath weapon from. Most of the poison is abstracted from young dragons, although it would be the most powerful found in an ancient Dragons neck gland. Most harvesters of this poison steal eggs from a dragons neck, or capture baby dragons when they are first leaving their mother's nest. It is an extremely dangerous occupation, but extremely rewarding if done successfully. A young dragon can make one use of this poison. The gland is compressed and combined with compressed air in a glass vial to give it the exploding nature that it is known for. It is easily smelled from up to 200 feet away, but nearly invisible, which is why it is known as a fart. | DC 17 Constitution saving throw or speed is reduced by 30 to a minimum of 5 feet, the targets cannot take actions and they take 2d10 damage of the type that the dragon the poison is made from corresponds to (Ex: Red would be 2d10 Fire Damage). The targets take half as much damage on a successful save. The poison can be thrown 60 feet, and expands into a 20 foot cloud. Dragons and Dragonborne are immune to the effects of this. | 110 GP | TheLordRuler02  |
|  4 | Wizard Bane | Injury
Ingested | This particular poison is made from the juices from the eye of a Beholder. The juices of this can be turned into a poison that once in the bloodstream of its victims, negates any ability for them to cast any Magic until the poison runs its course.
Legend has it, the poison was first used by complete accident as a band of adventurers were dealing with a mighty Wizard. The wizard was protected by Beholder and during the battle between the adventures, one lone fighter was able to end the beholders life by stabbing his greatsword deep through its middle eye. After this, the fighter then charged the wizard and was able to gash him with the same sword. As the wizard reeled away from this and attempted to cast a powerful spell that should end the fighter's life, nothing happened. The adventurers then overcame this wizard and noticed in his eyes, that he was completely powerless for the first time in his life. | DC 16 Constitution Saving Throw. On a failed save, a creature/character can not cast any Magic for the duration of the effect. This includes Cantrips. The effect lasts for 1d4 hours | 2500 GP | Curt S.  |

In addition, when the affected creature makes an action Contrary to their changed alignment, they must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw, or take 2d6 psychic damage. A lesser restoration spell or other similar effect dispels this poison. | 850 GP | /u/Elsthar  |
|  41 | Dragon's Kiss | Inhaled | Dragon's Kiss is harvested from the glands that create a chromatic dragon's breath weapon shortly after it dies. The glands are dried and crushed into a powder, which can be blown into a victim's face. There are many kinds of this poison, as it's effects differ with the type of dragon it is harvested from. This powder can be transferred safely in a normal bag, just don't get it wet. | After inhaling, the victim must make a DC 20 Con save. On a fail or success, the creature takes the amount of damage and type of damage equal to the color of the dragon's breathe weapon the poison is made from. On a save, the creature takes half of the damage. | Average price on the black market is 2000 GP for a dose | /u/galacticConquer er03  |

|  42 | Wanderer's
Fate | Ingested | Partially named after the plant it is harvested from, Wanderer's Fate is drawn from the shoots of Wanderlust, a stout and clover-like plant. It's historically used as a deterrent for vermin, but applications on larger creatures should not be ignored. | Once ingested, the Consumer must make a DC 15 Con save. If failed, the Consumer takes a -3 penalty to Wis and Cha rolls. In addition, the Consumer begins to lose their sense of direction; any time they wish to navigate somewhere alone or unaided, the target must succeed on a DC 17 investigation check, or become lost. These effects last for 1d10-Con mod hours. | House-use doses for vermin can be purchased for 3-6 SP; doses for use on humanoids cost around 10 GP | Tay  |
|  43 | Legionary's
Lament | Ingested | A recipe initially devised by the Twenty-eighth Archcotare of Midmarch, this toxin is usually mixed with other uncolored, odorless liquids -- such as water. Although there is no known lethal dose, it remains a potent and well-known tool in the repertoires of saboteurs and military spies everywhere due to its extremely low minimum effective dose. Deviously designed by the Archcotare specifically not to kill its victims, he instead intended to halt the advance of a superior army into Midmarch's capital region by bringing its provisioning needs into crisis. Ingredients: black pearl (powdered), drake spleen (cured), leather from a boot that has seen 20 years' campaigning, and tears of laughter. | DC 14 Con save is taken four hours after imbibing a fluid mixed with Legionary's Lament. Characters succeeding suffer a stomachache with minor mechanical effect at GM's discretion. Characters failing are affected and will, over the next twelve hours, become at once increasingly irritable and increasingly lethargic. This tendency will coincide with an enormous increase in appetite and somewhat lesser increase in metabolism. Affected characters, as may be surmised, are ultimately detrimental to groups or societies that they are members of for 48-60 hours after symptoms reach full pitch, as they are nearly Constantly either arguing, squabbling, complaining, eating, sleeping, defecating, or resting. Perhaps the most important mechanical effect, though, is that affected characters must Consume triple rations of food and water or feel that they are starving (and to some extent they are), with all the usual effects. | Only commonly produced in capital cities for state use. 15 GP for enough black pearl to poison a well; the alchemist risking producing this for the black market, though, may charge hundreds for her service. | /u/sapphon  |
|  44 | Bergeron's
Doom | Inhaled,
Ingested | This potent paralytic compound is derived from the bright blue bloom of the Poison Berrik vine. It is said that the Berrik vine was cursed long ago by a court jester named Bergeron who could not get the nobles of his court to so much as crack a smile. Now, Bergeron's Doom does what the hapless jester could not, and the results are so gruesome, they're almost funny. | DC 18 Con saving throw. On a success, the affected creature experiences some sinus irritation and mild hiccups for 1d4 hours. On a failure, the affected creature falls prone and begins laughing unControllably. Every round, the creature must repeat the saving throw to end the effect, with the DC reduced by 1/2 (rounded up) for every failed check. If this seCond check is failed, the creature takes 1d6 Necrotic damage for every failed check (1d6 after the first failure, 2d6 after the seCond, etc). If the affected creature drops to 0 hit points, they fall unConscious and the poison's effect ends. After the poison wears off, the affected creature suffers 1 level of exhaustion for every 4 failed checks. | 2500-3500 GP | /u/Shamus_Aran  |

It is said that the venom causes all affected by it to have an allergic reaction to their hands, causing massive swelling and pain. | Make a DC 17 CON save. On a success, a creature is overcome with a short bout of weakness, causing it to drop whatever it is holding. On a failure, a creature's hands turn into puffy, useless blobs totally incapable of holding anything. This effect lasts for one minute. A creature may save against the poison at the end of each of its successive turns. | 50 GP | Anonymous  |
|  46 | Blue Water | Ingested | Found in caves deep underground, often surrounded by luminescent mushrooms. These pools of water are rare, and only found in deep caves in rocky areas. The natural stones give off some kind of unknown power to the water, making it glow light blue. | Once ingested, the Consumer must succeed a DC 15 Con save or suffer a point of poison. Repeat each day for 2d4 days. If the Consumer fails half of the saves he/she suffer a permanent -2 to their Constitution. Poison points and negative affect can be removed with greater restoration. | 5000 GP
(Extremely rare) | /u/Dramary  |
|  47 | Plane's Mist | Inhaled | An ever swirling purple-ish and thick liquid used by both poisoners and addict for its surprising effects. The substance is made by magic with distilled water from other planes infused with blood. Plane's Mist can only be taken as some sort of incense, You boil it and the vapors, aka the mist, give the effect. Because of the weak potency of the mist you must be in an enclose room to feel the effects Drinking it has never been done before but could only be something bad and interesting. | DC 12 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save the target falls into a trance of sort after feeling a kind of dizziness. During the trance it appears that you can see in a random plane (roll on a table of the number of planes in your game) as if your head was breaking the water surface and pearing in a pool. The memories of the trip are always fuzzy and absent of details. After the trance you are poisoned for a d6 hours and gain one level of exhaustion. People who succeed on the saving throw only gains the level of exhaustion and are Considered poison for 1d4 minutes because of the smoke. | 350 GP | Dunwel  |

Dust | Inhaled | Created from glowing mushrooms spores found in deep in caves or dungeons, this poison is commonly unknowingly inhaled by adventurers only for the effects to be revealed later. | DC 12 Con save. However, effects only trigger with Contact with bright light. After absorbing said light, entering an otherwise shadowy or dark area will cause a release of light as the Light spell, fading over the same period of time (maximum 10 minutes).

|  49 | Glassblood | Injury | Favoured by drow torturers, this clear syrupy liquid, rapidly spreads within the victim's bloodstream causing debilitating pain when struck with blunt objects. Ideal for long sessions of "information gathering" when drow are thought to be planning escapes to the surface. It's manufacture is known only to the Priestesses of Lolth, who distill the substance from Phase Spider venom and mix it with the rendered fat of those who betray the Queen of Webs. The victim usually becomes the latter. | DC 16 Con save. On a failure, for the next hour the victim gains resistance to Piercing Damage but is Stunned for 1 Round if it takes Bludgeoning Damage unless it succeeds another DC 16 Con save. If the Bludgeoning Damage is dealt by a Critical Hit, the victim must make a DC 16 Con save or be Stunned for 1 Minute as their body suffers the horrible agony of their blood breaking into thousands of . | Average price on the black market is 500GP for a dose. | Eggs_Maledict  |
|  50 | Gambit | Ingested | Originally developed as a deadly poison by assassins of the Dragon's Claw, Gambit was quickly discovered to occasionally enhance the target's abilities instead of causing their demise. For that reason, the assassin's guild quickly abandoned use of the poison in favor of more reliable ones. However, some people today still use the substance as both a risky performance enhancing drug or as an equally risky toxin. The process to create this substance is a well guarded secret, but the materials used are suspected to include both things of great healing properties and natural toxicity. | The target must make a DC 15 CON saving throw. On a failed save the target is poisoned for 1d8 hours. While poisoned in this way, roll 1d6. If the result is even, the target takes 1d8 poison damage every minute and suffers a -1 penalty to all checks using WIS. If the result is odd, the target instead gains a +2 bonus to both STR and DEX and has a passive wisdom of 15 (if it wasn't at least that high beforehand). On a successful save, the target is not poisoned. | 50 GP | Huulkinat  |
|  51 | Prestidigitator's Patois-
Paralyzing
Pepper Potion | Ingested | Prepared from a particularly pungent patch of alpine peppers, the Prestidigitator's Patois-Paralyzing Pepper Potion was produced primarily as a provincial product of the parish of a specific potentate. Previously presented by a potluck participant, it's pure potent power was repurposed as a poison specifically planned to put the palates of particular prestidigitators past their purposes. | DC 15 Con save. If failed, the creature's mouth goes tingly and numb for roughly 10d6 minutes, rendering speech awkward and difficult. An affected creature has a disadvantage on any actions that require vocalization to enact/activate. Spells cast that require a vocal component suffer a -5 to their spell save DC. If the affected creature currently has an active Concentration spell or ability, they must make a DC 15 saving throw to maintain it. | 10 GP (often purchased as a gag gift or a prank to play on friends) | /u/Lestenna  |
|  52 | Meklor's Toad
Juice | Contact | Created with a mixture of toxins extracted from various venomous toads this poison dramatically slows and relaxes the victim. It's glassy, clear, and quite viscous. It sticks easily to skin, and to clothing. Invented not as a poison, but as a medicinal anesthetic, the touch of the poison rapidly numbs the skin and the mind. Those exposed report tingling in their extremities, and powerful, though benign, hallucinations. | DC 10 Con save. On success, victim moves to the bottom of the initiative order. If they have already acted this round, they do not act again until the following round. Upon failure, the creature is dramatically slowed. Movement speed is halved, and all attacks made by them have disadvantage. All attacks against them have advantage. This effect is ended with another DC 10 CON saving throw made at the end of their turn. If raging, target must make DC 10 WIS save or be so calmed by the effects of the poison that the rage ends. | 20 GP | /u/NPCmiro  |
|  53 | The Harpy's
Tears | Ingested | A slightly opaque, white liquid, distilled, as the name implies, from the tears of a male harpy wept under a full moon. | DC 15: Wisdom Save. On a failed save, the target is entranced by melodies inside their own mind, and will immediately begin to travel in a random direction. The target stays moving in that direction, unless prevented by an obstacle, at which time the direction will change at random again. The target can make one saving throw each hour that passes. While under the effects, the target cannot speak or hear others speaking to them. The effects of the poison wear off after 12 hours. | 800 GP | Ricky W.  |

|  54 | Mariner's Bane | Ingested /
Injury/
Contact | A clear liquid, almost indistinguishable from salt water,
this poison was often used to eliminate naval targets of
opportunity by less than savoury pirates, assassins, and
admirals. The chief ingredients are salt water, wood
collected from the hold of a wrecked ship- usually one
sunk in battle, the bloodier the better, but any suitably
tragic accident will suffice-and any one of a number of
slightly more Conventional poisons (the inventors swear
by distilled Wyvern or Manticore venom for the best
results). The poison is added to the salt water and a ritual
calling on the vengeance of the sea for the victims of the
shipwreck performed, at which point the wood from the
wreck is added. The result is a poisonous substance that
is almost impossible to determine as a poison, instead
taking on the characteristics of fresh seawater. | Although indistinguishable from salt water by any normal inspection,
a detect Poison and Disease spell will reveal the true nature of this
substance. The target must make a DC 15 WIS saving throw. On a
failed save the target becomes obsessed with water (especially the
ocean) for 1 hour. The target must use its action to move towards or
into the nearest large source of water that it knows of. Once
submerged in water, the target must make a DC 13 WIS saving
throw on each turn spent submerged and poisoned. On a failed save
the target attempts to breath in water and drown itself resulting in
3d10 necrotic (?) damage. On a successful save the target is no
longer under the influence of the obsession with water. | 250 GP | C0LdP5yCh0

of Korb
Nagglebrek's
Slimy Limes of
Time | Contact | A viscous substance with a bright green hue that vibrates
slightly as it comes into Contact with the victim's skin. The
substance is the brainchild of one Korb Nagglebrek; a
perverse halfling alchemist who dabbled in the dangerous
field of time-travel. Discovered as Nagglebrek attempted
to Convert a lime into the ideal time-travel fuel, the
substance causes the victim to revert to an age where
they felt the most joy in life. This sensation feels like the
greatest release of pain and grief the victim has ever felt,
as if one has not been able to cry for a decade. However
this lasts only briefly, as then the substance catapults the
victim forward in time, leaving them in their last moments
of death. Korb has said of the substance that it is "not his
worst work". | DC 18 Con save, then - if applicable - a DC 14 Wis save. If the Con
save is failed, the afflicted character is aged back to the age they
determine to be the happiest in their life. However, the GM may
choose to overrule any decision made by the player to an age more
reasonable or suitable, at the GM's discretion. After 1d6 minutes the
character is then aged rapidly to within the age of their death, as
determined by their race. If the character in question fails the Con
save, then a WIS Save is required. If this too is failed, then the
character receives the mind of the age they have been aged to. If the
Constitution save is successful, then the character feels a slight
sense of nostalgia and no other adverse effects. | 1 PP | Joseph Crook

|  57 | Poison of
Poisons
Laira's Poison
of Mystery | Ingested | This poison was once made by Laira, when she found herself in a mischievous mood. The poison has a different colour to each person who lays their eyes on the vial. Some see it as a light pink with glitters, some as an oozy black with chunks. It is said that no two individuals will ever see the same thing inside the vial, but that is yet to be proved. Taste, smell, texture, and even at times sound the poison makes, also changes per person. All these attributes also change after Consuming one of the dosages. The downside is, the poison isn't simply made by mortals, and can only be done so by deities. The ingredients are unknown, but they are all imbued with divine energy. This is an extremely rare poison not often found. | Each poison vial comes with 4 doses.
Roll 1d100, and the poison that corresponds to that number on THIS list gets applied (even if the poison type is different).
The DM, if they so wish, can add and/or remove effects such as Consequences for using the poison. All the effects of the poison will be at double the power. Including Consequences, effects added or removed, both against and for the PCs interest. Saving throws remain the same, however, the effect gets doubled. If dice are involved such as 1d4 it will become, up to the DMs decision, 2d4, 1d8 or 2d8. In case Poison of Poisons (PoP) is rolled again, they will be effected with an Poison of Poisons (II). In this case, the Consumer of the poison re-rolls a 1d100, and repeats the previous steps; however, any and all effects will be doubled again in power, so four times the original power. If Poison of Poisons is rolled again for a third time, it becomes a Poison or Poisons (III), in which all powers are octupled. For every additional PoP roll, the effect power doubles twice from the previous amount. PoP (III) doubles the power of Pop (II) while a PoP (V) doubles the power of PoP (IV), which in itself is a double of the previous. The effects the player gains after Consuming the poison are unbeknownst to the player, unless clearly visible. An example being: The PoP ended up giving PC +5 to Strength. When doing a strength check, the DM will add the +5 strength to their throw without telling the player of this. However, if the player feels nauseous, they will immediately be able to tell. If they become resistant to fire, they will not know until they are set ablaze. The PC can attempt to figure out the effects of the poison by doing a saving roll for the closest attribute to the effect of the poison (Con, Dex, Int, Etc.). The DM can at any time change any of the above to be more fitting to what they need. The DM, if they so wish, can also provide players with a Poison of Poisons (I/II/III/IV/V etc) The strength of the effect will equal to: $2^{k} x$, where $x$ is number prescribed in the PoP (I/II/III/etc.). | 500 GP | Anonymous  |

Depending on the degree of success, the target believes they will suffer harm or some setback, either physical or mental, which the players and DM decide between themselves. Once the poison is somehow applied or ingested, the target must make a DC 8 wisdom saving throw to see if they actually feel like something is happening. | 10 SP to 2 GP (dependant on quality of jelly and amount of raisins) | Nick P  |
|  60 | Dreammist | Ingested | A rainbow coloured, viscous liquid, made with the tail of a coati. Its vapours permeate the air around it with an uncanny sweetness. The poison is taken as a recreational drug by those desperate enough to want to do so, but runs the risk of corrupting their bodies long-term. It is often used by assassins or rogues as a non-lethal means of bypassing their foes, or forcing them to have terrible visions that haunt them in the future. | The target who ingests this poison experiences vivid hallucinations of their wildest desires. If failing a DC 13 wisdom saving throw, the target promptly falls asleep for 6d6 minutes, and on waking, their visions turn into a nightmare, dealing 3d6 psychic damage. Successfully saving against this poison allows the target to experience these hallucinations but otherwise maintain their faculties. Each ingestion of dreammist before a long rest increases the saving throw DC by 3. | 50 GP | Jamie M  |

|  61 | Clockmaker's
Bane | Injury | A black, oily substance that looks almost exactly like mechanical grease or lantern oil, it was originally devised by the gnomish assassin, Perticulo, in response to a request from a friend to dispose of a rival artificer. Magically refined from a mixture of lycanthrope blood, displacer beast saliva and black jelly residue, coupled with stabilizing agents, it was specifically designed to kill slowly and appear to be natural progression of a disease while remaining non-magical in nature, so as not to alert the artificer and allied mages as to its nefarious purpose. Given its unusually persistent effectiveness, Perticulo refined and honed the recipe over many years and used it repeatedly as a subtle way to dispose of magically attuned folk and those prone to low vitality. His refinements caused it to lose some of it's potency and ease of deliverance, but remained a niche and effective tool in his arsenal for many years until he was eventually killed by a werebeaver, trying to procure more. The poison disappeared from use for decades before his notes were eventually unearthed, and the Thieves Guild began manufacturing and distributing it more abundantly. | Must be applied with slashing or piercing damage only. The victim must make a DC 8 CON save. On a failure, they gain one level of fatigue. On a success, they gain -1 CON. The Constitution penalty cannot be restored or avoided without the use of a 5th level spell or higher (such as Greater Restoration). Fatigue inflicted by this poison cannot be cured through rest. This roll is repeated every 24 hours from the time of injury. The poison does not do damage, nor inflict the poisoned Condition, and so cannot be resisted, and will not be detected by Detect Magic, nor will it be revealed by Detect Poison and Disease, unless the character specifically targets the viscous poison itself (note: once inside a victim, it will not be revealed in this fashion either, unless the character has knowledge of the poison and it's effects.) Once the victim has reached a -10 modifier to CON (10 successful saves, or more if Greater Restoration is used), the poison loses potency, and they regain 1 CON every 24 hours after for the next 10 days until they are back to their normal modifier, as well as recovering 1 level of exhaustion induced by the poison each day. The poison can be delayed indefinitely through Greater Restoration, but can only be neutralized before it's end through directed use of a curing or restorative spell with specific knowledge of the poison (cannot be cured randomly with magic or non-specific antitoxins), or a 9th level spell (such as Power Word Heal, or Wish directed at curing the ailments of the victim.) The victim dies only if they reach 0 CON, or Level 6 Exhaustion. | 350 GP per vial from select, anti-arcane branches of the Thieves guild. It is not difficult to manufacture, but its knowledge and recipe are carefully guarded secrets, found only in specialty books and known to master poisoners. (vial Contains 100 doses)  |
|  62 | Whiz-o-wisp | Contact | Made from Will-o-Wisp urine collected on the Ethereal Plane. Usually made by night hags or other creatures that frequently harvest souls. Comes in a fist sized clay pot that is thrown at target. Clay pot is warm to the touch and has a static charge that tends to raise the wielder's hair. | On Contact the target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save takes 3d6 lightning damage and until the end of it's next turn, sheds bright light in a number of feet equaling the number of damage taken. On a successful save the target takes half damage and becomes invisible until the end of its next turn. If target is wearing metal armor the Constitution save is made with disadvantage. | 300 GP  |
|  63 | Stirge Nectar | Contact | Most commonly used by swamp dwelling creatures such as Lizardfolk, Stirge Nectar is a foul smelling and sticky substance made from rotting fruit of the quince tree mixed with stagnant swamp water. Often thrown in thin pouches or clay pots at targets, or used in traps to ward off trespassers. | Upon Contact target must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save the target becomes incapacitated (by nausea). The target remains incapacitated until it succeeds a saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save it does not become incapacitated. Regardless of saving throw result, the smell of nectar will attract a pack of $1 \mathrm{~d} 4+3$ Stirges within 1d4 rounds, that immediately attack the target. | 3 GP per half gallon "splash"  |
|  64 | Purple Pollen | Inhaled /
Contact with
Eyes | Made from the spores of Violet Fungus mixed with powdered peppers. Often found in areas close to Underdark entrances. Comes in a vellum pouch roughly the size of a fist. Once mixed this powder loses all potency after 4 days. | Once inhaled or thrown into eyes of target, target must make a DC 20 Constitution save. On a failed save target takes 1d8 Necrotic damage, and suffers a random short-term madness (DMG pg #259). On a successful save target takes half damage and no madness effect. | 250 GP  |
|  65 | Faerie Fire | Contact | The exact formula is a secret known only to a certain band of forest gnomes, but it is believed to be distilled from the breath of Faerie Dragons and extracts of several types of fungi mixed with extremely potent distilled spirits. The forest gnomes use it as a prank to test the mettle of non-gnomes who visit them, mixing it into a drink, or offering it as an aperitif. | DC 15 Con saving throw. On a success, creature experiences a mild and pleasant euphoria lasting 1d4 hours. During this time, all rolls are made with disadvantage and movement rate is half normal. On a failure, the creature experiences hallucinations and paranoia - treat as being under the effects of a Confusion spell - for 1d4 hours. Regardless of the save, after the effect wears off, treat as suffering a level of exhaustion until a long rest is taken. | Not commonly sold to outsiders (but often used to dose them as a prank). It might be given to those who have done a service to the gnome band  |

|  67 | Angel's Breath | Inhaled | Discovered accidentally after a couple of lovers wandered deep into a forest and smelled the wrong wild flower, this bright, royal blue powder is made from the pollen of those flowers. It needs to be refined in order to be maximally effective (as described here). It is now used by criminal organizations to rob naive travelers, especially when they are few in number. It is so potent, that all a criminal needs to do is take a handful out of his pocket when close to his mark, unfold his hand not far from the victim's face, and blow the powder in their direction. | The target must make a DC 15 WIS saving throw or else enter a pleasant twilight state for 1d4 hours, during which the body is still fully functional, as if the mind wandered off somewhere and the body became a functional zombie. While in this state, the target is extremely open to suggestion, as if under the effects of a Charm Person spell. When the effect wears off, the target has no memory of anything that occurred during the episode. This only affects Humanoid types, regardless of immunity to Charm since the mechanisms of action are different from spells. | Its refined form is only available for purchase from a Thieves' Guild or other similar criminal organization. Price varies depending on perceived level of need, usually charging 500 GP or more per dose. | DAE  |

The red, opaque gemstone is mined in areas of volcanic activity and can then be crushed into a fine powder, easily mixed with water (tasteless), or heated to a vapor (smells like rotten eggs). | The target must make a DC 16 CON saving throw. On a failed save the target takes 3d6 poison damage and becomes poisoned. When poisoned like this, the target has an itching sensation all over and experiences profuse sweating. Additionally, the target experiences impaired vision resulting in a -1 penalty to all attack rolls and skill checks that require sight. After 1 day without treatment, the target suffers insomnia and cannot complete a full rest. After 2 days without treatment, the target is overcome with weakness and memory impairment resulting in a -2 penalty to both STR and INT. | 500 GP | Huulkinat  |
|  69 | Quadruple
Foul | Ingested | A poison made by mixing a variety of other poisons to achieve devastating effects | The target must make 4 DC16 CON saving throws, and will receive the effects of whichever ones fail. Multiple effects will not be active at the same time, and instead will activate when the previous effect ends. 1st: Poisoned for 1d2 hours. 2nd: Paralyzed for 1d2 hours. 3rd: deafened for 1d2 hours. 4th: Blinded for 1d2 hours. | Received from quest asking for one potion of each effect it inflicts.

Special | Ingested | Originally a cantrip designed by magical entertainers, the Smokeball Special was a spell for Conjuring and directing a small ball of smoke. However, after audience members who accidentally inhaled the smoke fell ill, the spell was banned. A few unscrupulous performers who had been involved in the practise sold the secret of the cantrip to a hooded figure. A few months later, word among thieves' guilds spread of a poison that could suffocate a target long after they had been poisoned. The Smokeball Special is now most easily procured from hooded figures who peddle their wares on new moons at midnight. | The Smokeball Special comes in capsule form, and when opened, releases a fine grey powder. The powder can be added to food or drink, and leaves a hint of campfire smoke once mixed. If the food/drink was not prepared on/near a cooking fire, DC 13 Perception to detect that the food/drink has been interfered with (DC 18 if fire was involved). 3 hours after ingestion of Smokeball Special, the affected creature feels like vomiting. However, the only thing their stomach is capable of ejecting is a viscous cloud of dark grey smoke. This smoke flows into the lungs, and fills the creature's nose and mouth. The creature spends 1d6+3 rounds coughing out the smoke. The creature can not take any other actions during this period. The creature must make a DC 15 Constitution save each round. On a failure, they take 1d10 fire damage as their respiratory system is ravaged. On a success, take half damage. Once all the smoke is expelled, the creature is free of the smoke and can act as normal from the following round. If the poisoned creature is asleep at the time the poison takes effect, they are woken up and have disadvantage on their first save. | 200 GP | /u/ApertureJunkieZ

|  74 | Slight
Discomfort | Inhaled | Developed by the cursed Wizard Pal'zerus, whose luck was always decided by a coin toss, he stumbled upon a secret recipe to create a distracting poison that would render opponents in battle unable to concentrate. Made from mosquito saliva, poison ivy, rose hip, ground feathers of a Griffon and strained through the roughest sheep wool, Slight Discomfort was made as a nonviolent way to help turn the tide of battle. Slight Discomfort was adopted by many city guard garrisons as a way to help disperse gathering delinquent crowds as well as break up riots in progress. | One dose of Slight Discomfort can be thrown to cause a 10ft burst that affects all creatures caught within the effect. (Additional doses added increase the radius by 5ft for a maximum of 25ft) A creature caught in the effect must succeed at a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or become affected by Slight Discomfort. While under the effects of Slight Discomfort, creatures begin to notice an itching sensation in their palms, or what may Constitute their palms Effects: Every attack made by the creature is at a disadvantage as they become too focused on the desire to scratch the litch.
Save: In order to not be at a disadvantage, a creature must make a DC 7 Will Saving throw to overcome the desire to scratch. In doing so, they are not affected by the Slight Discomfort. The save must be made every round and increases by 1 for every successful save made. If a creature spend their action to scratch the litch however, the DC resets back to 7 and the affected creature does not have to make another saving throw for 1d4+1 rounds. Slight Discomfort runs its course after 5 minutes, but a DC 15 Constitution saving throw can be made every minute to end the effect early. | 350 GP | /u/HosturCarcosa  |

Those administering the poison would be standing by in order to dispatch them quickly. Usually created in mass quantities and produced for large meals and to be mixed with food and drink. Usually made from unknown substances found in the fire plane. | The target must succeed on a DC 17 Con Save or becomes paralyzed until lesser restoration is cast on the victim. If lesser restoration is cast within 4 hours of drinking the poison, the target must make a DC 15 Wis Save or will become dependent on the poison and must find more or suffers 1d12 psychic damage every day without ingesting the poison. This cycle can only be broken by casting greater restoration on the target and then all effects are removed. | 750 GP | Boomdabah  |
|  76 | Dwarven
Resilience | Ingested | When dwarven ale brewers took things a little too far, Dwarven Resilience was made. Too potent for even the hardiest dwarves, it was banned from most meaderies, but with the right words to the right people, you may get your hands on some. | A single dose of Dwarven Resilience can be mixed into any beverage or liquid, leaving an earthy stench. A creature can attempt a DC 15 perception check to notice that their drink has been tampered with. A creature that drinks Dwarven Resilience must succeed a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 hour.

Lasts for 1 hour, then fades back to normal vision over 10 minutes. | Why would anyone sell this? Because I'd buy it. | DorkMage  |
|  78 | Viper Weed | Inhaled | Viper Weed usually grows in swamps where the veil between dimensions is unusually weak, Viper Weed is a small, red, tube shaped plant often mistaken for cinnamon at first, but when curious adventurers get too close it spits a cloud of spores into the air blinding the adventurer, and causing intense coughing if inhaled. Assassins started harvesting the spores by placing a cup on the plant before it releases the spores, and started using it to debilitate targets. | DC 18 Con save: on a fail the target is blinded and rendered incapacitated for 10 minutes. | 250 gp | Evan L  |

|  79 | Moradin's
Tears | Ingested | It was one of the most popular dwarven drinks long ago. Now, however, it is feared throughout the known world. It was found out that the sumptuous beverage can actually kill many of the races of the land. Dwarves, as well as most ground-dwellers are immune to this potent poison. However, races with weaker bodies, such as elves or humans, can sometimes be killed instantly. Not much is known about how to prepare this dreaded abomination of an ale. However, it is theorized that, in order to achieve such potency a higher power of some sort was involved somehow. Many people, at this point, bring up the story of Nak'til the Wild. This half-orc was born during the great segregationist movement in the human and elf kingdom and thus was shunned by society as a whole. So he moved to one of the great dwarven mine-cities. There, he found affection and love that he never truly could in the world he was born in. He later became an adventurer and, by luck, was granted a small favor by Asmodeus himself. He chose to reward his friends, the dwarves by granting the thing they loved most - ale. So he told Asmodeus "I wish there was a drink which was easy to get and which only the dwarves could truly enjoy." And Asmodeus made sure that only the dwarves would enjoy it. | DC 20 Con Sav. On a fail, the drink slowly kills the target from inside. It presents itself as a harmless, bubbly, yellow ale. It has an incredible sweet taste and, if mixed with most ale, it will blend in, making it the perfect poison. However, if drunk by any race susceptible to it, it will deal 1d4 acid damage which cannot be prevented to them at the first dawn. You see, it is a highly caustic poison and as it burns through one layer of flesh, it gets more potent. At the second dawn, the person takes 1d6 damage. Then 1d8, 1d10, 1d12, 1d20, until finally, on the dawn of the seventh, it deals 1d100 caustic damage then and on any dawn thereafter, if any. A person dying from Dwarf's Poison may not be healed while the poison is in their system. If the person dies from the poison, the liquid, now turned a sickly green first pokes through the front of the belly, bursting through what little flesh the creature will have at that point. Once activated by (turned green) by ingestion by a non-dwarf, it will essentially turn into a highly dangerous acid. It may be neutralized by a holy ritual toward a good deity, but not while in a creature. The only magical way to get the poison out of a person is the use of a Wish spell. | Depending on where you go, it may cost nothing or, quite literally, your soul and then some. It is most abundant in dwarf cities, where it can be bought from many apothecaries as "Dragon Unguent". There, the general price is somewhere around 50-100 GP for one dose, which is about one third of a dwarven cup (125 mL). It can also be found in the human world for double the price and Asmodeus may sell it to you himself, but his prices differ. Finally, you may be able to find some in your own cup, and that's free. | Hidrog  |

Could be objects of sentimental value, remains of a loved one or pet, something crafted with love and care, or expensive jewelry. Sacrifice is the name of the game. If objects of tremendous importance or great amounts of revenge are put into the making of the potion, the effects should amplify appropriately. Often made with a target in mind. | Must be applied to a weapon a few hours (4ish) in advance; If not, the effects are halved. The target must succeed a DC 18 Con save or sprout a small limb out of the wound or bruise. The limb is a bonethin white arm with a small hand on the end of it. The hand has three long pointy fingers and a thumb that grip a small dagger made of bone. It is squishy to the touch. It 'lives' for 24 hours and Constantly makes +1 attacks on its host and does $1 \mathrm{~d} 2+2$ damage if successful. This attack happens on the turn of the host during combat. Can be cut off with a sharp weapon; DC 14 Con save 4d4 damage on fail, half on success. If ripped off bare handed, the wound it leaves remains open and does not heal without the aid of magic along with doing 4d4 damage. If ignored for the full 24 hours, it starts drying out and wilts off the host like a dying leaf but no other damage is taken. It can also be held immobile with one's hand (str 6 grapple) or bound with rope and it will struggle to free itself until it does so or dies off. Can be removed by a restoration spell or quality healing potion without worry. The little arm is also affected by any Condition the host is; if the host is knocked unConscious so is the little arm.

|  81 | Viral Mite | Ingested | A small insect that procreates through parasitism. It latches itself onto food. Once entered the host, the insect slowly multiplies inside the body until enough of the host body has been Consumed by the insect.

Upon Consumption, inflicted target must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On success, the target vomits out the recently Consumed item and bug.

The moment he entered he was overwhelmed by the bitter smell of decay, mingled with blood's tinny odor. However, he remained and won the 10 gold. It was only once he had grown older that he realized that that was the Lair of a Hag. He spent hours trying to replicate the dizzying effect of the inside of the smell, to no avail. Breakthrough came when he Considered that the smell came from the perversion of beauty. Hags whiff is created by dissolving the flower of a lilac in a mixture of 1 part honey to 2 parts milk. After letting the mixture sit for 4 days in the sun, a cup of the blood of a twice dead animal is added and the mixture is brought to a boil. The final ingredient are the spores of the shrieker. The mixture is placed in a barrel and left to sit in the sun for 1 month. | Constitution DC: 14 In a single dose the effects of this poison is a -3 to perception and nature rolls, the subject will be impotent for one month, as well as a lingering fascination with corruption.

|  96 | Thief's
Revenge | Ingested | It is one of the most popular suicide poisons. It is often used by spies who cannot afford getting caught. In order to make this poison, one must put together a pinch of onyx, as well as a dash of chestnut, caustic slime ooze and dragon's flame. The final step in the creation process is also the most important: piece of skin from the afflicted. The piece must be about 5x5 cm and must be dissolved in the potion. | Once ingested, the poisoned must make a DC 5 Constitution saving throw, which they may choose to fail. If the saving throw is not failed, nothing happens. If it is, the poisoned dies instantly by internal bleeding. After death, the poison quickly dissolves the body from the inside out, over the course of about five minutes. After those five minutes, the corpse violently explodes, dealing 5d10 force damage to creatures within 30 meters of it. One may take half damage if he or she succeeds a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. Any structures within the area are badly damaged and the body is destroyed. The soul of the victim is scattered by this poison, requiring nothing less than a Wish spell to even bring it back. | 200 GP for about 5 ml of the potent substance.

|  98 | Guilt | Any - comes in many forms | Roll another poison. This batch of Guilt is indistinguishable from the specified poison. Made by treating the specified poison with a purifying anti venom from the Feywild. The powder that makes Guilt was the brainchild of a Sprite named Gillywug the Gleeful as a prank. | Guilt mimics the effects of the specified poison, but requires a DC 14 Con save instead. Any damage dealt on a fail is psychic, and the target's physical body otherwise suffers no ill effects (though it may perceive otherwise). On a success, the poison has no effect. | Cannot be bought. Must be procured or produced in the Feywild, commonly in exchange for a deal with the seller, the terms of which vary. | /u/TheOtherGuy52  |

Inhaled | A powder distilled from dried Ankheg venom. Commonly used in desert regions as its appearance is similar to grains of sand, hence the name.

Regardless, the target's mouth and throat become numb for 1d6 hours, causing slurred speech. In lower doses, this numbing is the only effect, and is prevented with a successful save. | 50 GP for a 10oz bag. Safe dose is anything less than a pinch. | /u/TheOtherGuy52  |

Slight Tongue
Discomfort | Contact | Used to cause numbness to the tongue, causing brief
discomfort and speech impediments. Commonly used by
jesters to appease their majesty. Originally created by a
mad food tester in a royal court, due to him hating the
royalties diet and the chef's recipes. Requires the blood of
a boar, root of tamarinds, and the saliva of a sleeping
goblin.

every 24 hours, after 3 days the effects are permanent. Effects: first
Contact, minor numbed tongue and swelling. Second day, tongue
turns purple as swelling Continues, loses all taste and character

inflated balloon is in your mouth. Characters tastebuds have been
ravished with almost no hope of tasting again (roll a DC 15 INT save
after eating to taste temporarily, just for the meal. Fourth day, effects
are permanent, (with DM's discretion.) | Price 150 GP,

Submissio
n | Loviatar's Folly | Ingested | Loviatar's Folly is a carefully guarded recipe reserved for
the greatest of Loviatar's enemies and for those that truly
desire seeing their enemy suffer. Loviatar's Folly is made
from the secretions of carrion crawler tentacles, the heart
of a flame snake and the animating spores of a myConid
sovereign suspended in a syrupy alchemical solution. | Despite its horrific components, it has a sticky sweet syrupy
composition that can be hard to detect when administered in sweet
mead, honey or winter wine. Those that ingest this poison suffer no ill
effects other than a tingly sensation on the tongue with a earthy
sweet aftertaste. 1d4 minutes later they become paralyzed (1 minute
duration) with a failed DC 13 CON save, beginning to sweat as their
temperature rises. The victim may repeat the saving throw at the end
of each of its turns to end the paralysis effect. At the same moment
the paralysis sets in, they feel an intense and excruciating burning
sensation that causes 1d8 fire damage to them and anyone that
comes within 5'. The victim may make a DC 17 CON save at the end
of each round to end the effect, but if the victim fails to save after 3
rounds, it explodes in a 20' radius 6d8 fireball centered on itself. (No
save for half damage) All that drop below 0 HP from the damaging
fireball are then animated as zombies attacking the nearest creature
within their line of sight. | This poison is
extremely rare
and its recipe a
well guarded
secret. A single
dose of this
ingested poison
costs no less
than 2,000gp if
the seeker is
lucky enough to
find it. | G Wolfe  |
