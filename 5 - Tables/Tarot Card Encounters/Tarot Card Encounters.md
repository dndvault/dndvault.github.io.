# BOUND BY CARDS The Tarot Encounter Deck 

IT IS A TRUTH UNIVERSALLY acknowledged that cards with the power to summon monsters are among the best things in life. Cards and monsters are already linked in too many media to recount, and this is by all accounts a great thing. For this reason, the tarot encounter deck was created to provide GMs an amusing and rewarding way of creating random combat encounters.

## Why a Random EnCOUNTER DECK?

The inspirational power of an encounter deck is not to be underestimated. A single "reading" of random monsters can inspire an entire dungeon or adventure, in case you need a fresh idea to start designing your next dungeon. Taken to the extreme, one can even generate a random dungeon and populate it with the encounter deck. (This is a fun choice for solo adventures and Halloween one-shots.)

If one of the players uses the cardcaster class*, creating encounters every so often using leftover tarot cards gives a sense of narrative control to the player who does not always have full control over their character's powers. Since tarot cards are aligned with the classical four elements, they also benefit characters and campaigns with elemental themes. Furthermore, if your campaign has an broad theme of divination, fate, or magical cards, you can use the options below to generate random encounters that enhance these motifs.

## Forbidden Fates

Those who use a tarot deck put their fate on the line with every draw. While a cardcaster's techniques wield the tarot safely, more casual readings may unleash forces beyond control. At the GM's option, a character performing a tarot reading can cast any divination spell of any level. Once the spell is cast, generate a tarot encounter of a tier appropriate for the spell cast (for example, generate a Paragon-tier encounter for a 6th-level divination spell). Those creatures appear within 1 d 4 miles of the fortune-teller and (unless friendly) seek to do them harm.

This may result in an encounter where a fortune-teller agrees to a reading, and the PCs must defend her. It may also result in a sly villain who intentionally distorts reality, and forces his enemies to pay the price. Players too are sure to tempt fate with this deadly rule, so be sure to ruthlessly capitalize on the creatures' collateral damage factor.

## Bound Beasts

Cardcasters who focus on the Jack of Beasts** specialize on unleashing monsters bound within their tarot cards. At your option, this tradition has troubling implications for the entire multiverse. In this variant, "monster tarot" cards are extremely rare and potent, and some spellcasters spend their arcane career creating such a deck. Many monster decks are incomplete-or scattered for fear of their power. Others lay sealed in secret tombs, a secret their wielder hoped would be forgotten.

When the PCs find a monster tarot card or an incomplete monster tarot deck in a treasure hoard, create a tarot encounter. The creatures appear within 5 miles of the PCs and (unless friendly) seek to harm them.

Once claimed, a character can permanently sacrifice a monster tarot card and arcane reagents worth $1,000 \mathrm{gp} \times$ the CR of the creature contained within the card. If the card summons multiple creatures, determine the effective experience total and round to the nearest CR. The creatures appear at the end of the sacrifice and will obey a single order issued by the character, as though the creature failed its saving throw against gees.

Alternatively, players might make it their personal objective to reconstruct a monster tarot deck, or return the cards to their rightful master. The GM can use these plot hooks to begin a new adventure, or interweave the threads into an ongoing adventure. Maybe the rightful owner of the monster tarot is an important spellcasting NPC, or a new cardcaster PC. Perhaps high-level operatives within certain organizations seek to keep the power of monster tarot a secret, and hunt those spellcasters who create them? What if a well-meaning operative in such an organization hears about the forbidden cards, and foolishly attempts to wield them for good?

## Making Tarot Encounters

Taking your real-life tarot deck, separate out all the high arcana cards. If you have a player using the cardcaster class, this means that you can each split one tarot deck. Shuffle the deck, and place a small number of cards in front of you. The number you should reveal are based on the number of PCs the encounter is designed for.

## Size of Tarot Encounter

| Number of PCs | Tarot Cards Revealed |
| :--: | :--: |
| $1-2$ | 1 |
| 3 | 2 |
| $4-5$ | 3 |
| $6+$ | 4 |

Each card revealed adds creatures to the encounter. The creatures generated per card are dependent upon the tier, or average level threshold, of the party.

## Tiers:

- Novice—Levels 1 through 4
- Veteran—Levels 5 through 10
- Paragon—Levels 11 through 16
- Legendary—Levels 17 through 20

If, once you calculate the experience total (including scaling for the number of creatures in combat) and you find that the combat is too weak, reveal another card. If the creature fits with the others-be that the budget total or your design goal for the encounter-then throw it in the bunch. You can also replace one of the first cards with the extra one revealed, or even throw out the lot favor of a single card.

If there are four or five party members, and their characters are in the upper levels of their. tier, you may consider upping the challenge even further. Do this by drawing one more card and refer to the creature list for the next highest tier. Using the next highest tier is also a great option if you prefer to run an many-versus-one encounter instead of a many-on-many combat.

## Modifying the Generator

This encounter deck was created with a few things in mind. It assumed that the encounters should all be land-based. It also assumed that the best assortment of creatures to draw from was the widest array possible, while still conforming to themes of each suit. If you campaign has other specific assumptions, or you want to include monsters outside the core game, you can modify the generation list. Simply replace creatures with those of a similar effective XP totals.

## The Minor Arcana

Each card entry, in addition to its tiered monster lists, also has a word or short phrase appended to it. This is a concise expression that approximates each of the cards' meanings in a tarot reading. If your random encounter generation occurs in front of players' eyes, you can create a sense of anticipation or foreboding by alluding to each card's meanings.

Many entries have special notations. Some entries require you to roll dice. Some entries produce a different creature if the card you reveal is right side up (upward) or upside-down (reversed). A creature denoted as friendly will be non-hostile to the player characters at first meeting; if it determines the PCs are basically or mostly Good-aligned, the creature will become friendly toward the party.
