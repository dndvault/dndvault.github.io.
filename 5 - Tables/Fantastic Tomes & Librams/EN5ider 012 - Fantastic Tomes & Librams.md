Fvery once in a while adventurers stumble across the study of an archmage, a long-lost library, a university, or even just a wizard's bedchamber. What book does a wizard have in his bedside table? What's on the shelves of the archmage's secret study? Which book is being talked about in the streets and taverns of the wealthy district?
Traditionally fantasy roleplaying games have included spellbooks and scrolls in treasure hoards. Sometimes a plot-important diary or journal may be featured, containing a vital clue or letter for the adventure. But what of all the other books, the ones that do not contain spells and aren't critical storywise?
You can use this article to generate a library of magical and non-magical books and tomes suitable for use in any fantasy roleplaying game. Until you've read Nori the Dark's
Resplendent Creed of Volatile Illusion, Dolin the Accursed's Dangerous Guide of Unknown Magics, and Bili the Umbral's Telestic Manual of Demented Divinity, you haven't lived! That's not to mention The Fine Handbook Of Divination and Husbandry, The Lexicon Of Illuminated Alchemy By Finor The Infernal, and the critically panned Transformation and Gambling: A Tome By Nofur The Numinous.
Simply roll 1d100. Each entry contains the book's name, its author, a short description, and an optional notation indicating its rarity, relative value, and number of pages.
